    cGAMP programs intestinal tolerance

    Description: Tissues are exposed to diverse inflammatory challenges that shape
    future inflammatory responses. While cellular metabolism regulates immune function,
    how metabolism programs and stabilizes immune states within tissues and tunes
    susceptibility to inflammation is poorly understood. Here, we describe an innate
    immune metabolic switch that programs long-term intestinal tolerance. Intestinal
    interleukin-18 (IL-18) stimulation elicited tolerogenic macrophages by preventing
    their proinflammatory glycolytic polarization via metabolic reprogramming to fatty
    acid oxidation (FAO). FAO reprogramming was triggered by IL-18 activation of SLC12A3
    (NCC), leading to sodium influx, release of mitochondrial DNA, and activation
    of stimulator of interferon genes (STING). FAO was maintained in macrophages by
    a bistable switch that encoded memory of IL-18 stimulation and by intercellular
    positive feedback that sustained the production of macrophage-derived 2''3''-cyclic
    GMP-AMP (cGAMP) and epithelial-derived IL-18. Thus, a tissue-reinforced metabolic
    switch encodes durable immune tolerance in the gut and may enable reconstructing
    compromised immune tolerance in chronic inflammation.

    towards carotenoid metabolism in tomato fruit. (Zeaxanthin metabolism)

    Description: Carotenoids are important secondary metabolites, which have been
    recognized as an essential component of the human diet because of their valuable
    beneficial health effects. With this rationale, there is a continuous aim to define
    the distribution of these compounds in plants, to better understand their metabolism
    and to increase their concentration levels in fruits and vegetables. This study
    aimed at deepening the knowledge on the regulatory role of phytohormones in carotenoid
    metabolism. More specifically, it was envisaged to reveal the phytohormones involved
    in the metabolism of alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, lycopene, lutein and zeaxanthin.
    To this purpose, the phytohormone profiles of 50 tomato fruits were determined
    by high-resolution Orbitrap mass spectrometry and evaluated towards the associated
    carotenoid levels. Data mining was performed by differential expression and orthogonal
    partial least squares analyses. This metabolomics approach revealed 5 phytohormonal
    metabolites, which significantly influenced (Variable Importance in Projection
    scores =0.80) carotenoid metabolism. These metabolites were identified as cis-12-oxo-phytodienoic
    acid, cucurbic acid, 2-oxindole-3-acetic acid, 1-acetylindole-3-carboxaldehyde,
    and cis-zeatin-O-glucoside. The involvement of the individual phytohormones towards
    carotenoid metabolism was investigated by regression analysis (P values =0.05,
    R2 varying between 0.280 and 0.760) and statistical correlation (P values =0.01,
    correlation varying between 0.403 and 0.846). It was concluded that these phytohormones
    all have significant contributing value in the regulation of carotenoid metabolism,
    thereby exhibiting down- and up-regulating influences. As a result, this knowledge
    encloses the potential for improving tomato fruit nutritional quality by targeted
    control of agronomic conditions, exogenous use of plant bioregulators, or genetic
    engineering.

    Description: Health effects of pesticides are not always accurately detected using
    the current battery of regulatory toxicity tests. We compared standard histopathology
    and serum biochemistry measures and multi-omics analyses in a subchronic toxicity
    test of a mixture of six pesticides frequently detected in foodstuffs (azoxystrobin,
    boscalid, chlorpyrifos, glyphosate, imidacloprid and thiabendazole) in Sprague-Dawley
    rats. Analysis of water and feed consumption, body weight, histopathology and
    serum biochemistry showed little effect. Contrastingly, serum and caecum metabolomics
    revealed that nicotinamide and tryptophan metabolism were affected, which suggested
    activation of an oxidative stress response. This was not reflected by gut microbial
    community composition changes evaluated by shotgun metagenomics. Transcriptomics
    of the liver showed that 257 genes had their expression changed. Gene functions
    affected included the regulation of response to steroid hormones and the activation
    of stress response pathways. Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of the same
    liver samples showed that 4,255 CpG sites were differentially methylated. Overall,
    we demonstrated that in-depth molecular profiling in laboratory animals exposed
    to low concentrations of pesticides allows the detection of metabolic perturbations
    that would remain undetected by standard regulatory biochemical measures and which
    could thus improve the predictability of health risks from exposure to chemical
    pollutants.

    from a low-dose pesticide mixture in rats

    Description: Health effects of pesticides are not always accurately detected using
    the current battery of regulatory toxicity tests. We compared standard histopathology
    and serum biochemistry measures and multi-omics analyses in a subchronic toxicity
    test of a mixture of six pesticides frequently detected in foodstuffs (azoxystrobin,
    boscalid, chlorpyrifos, glyphosate, imidacloprid and thiabendazole) in Sprague-Dawley
    rats. Analysis of water and feed consumption, body weight, histopathology and
    serum biochemistry showed little effect. Contrastingly, serum and caecum metabolomics
    revealed that nicotinamide and tryptophan metabolism were affected, which suggested
    activation of an oxidative stress response. This was not reflected by gut microbial
    community composition changes evaluated by shotgun metagenomics. Transcriptomics
    of the liver showed that 257 genes had their expression changed. Gene functions
    affected included the regulation of response to steroid hormones and the activation
    of stress response pathways. Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of the same
    liver samples showed that 4,255 CpG sites were differentially methylated. Overall,
    we demonstrated that in-depth molecular profiling in laboratory animals exposed
    to low concentrations of pesticides allows the detection of metabolic perturbations
    that would remain undetected by standard regulatory biochemical measures and which
    could thus improve the predictability of health risks from exposure to chemical
    pollutants.

    Description: Phosphorus limitation is pervasive in the oligotrophic surface ocean
    and marine microorganisms use different strategies to survive, and thrive, at
    these low nutrient levels. Eukaryotic algae such as diatoms are extremely sensitive
    to phosphorus limitation and recent transcriptomics work has suggested that multiple
    cellular processes are affected under these growth conditions. Metabolomics is
    the systematic study of intra- and extracellular metabolites, i.e. the end products
    of microbial metabolism. As such, metabolomics complements genomics and transcriptomics
    through the identification and quantification of metabolic intermediates that
    reflect cellular physiology. Here, we applied intracellular metabolomics to examine
    the differential response of the model diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana to phosphate-replete
    and phosphate-limited growth conditions. We focused on metabolites from the purine
    and pyrimidine biochemical pathways, due to their role in phosphorus cycling associated
    with nucleic acid synthesis. Under phosphate-replete conditions, T. pseudonana
    stored nucleotides with phosphate moieties such as adenosine 5''-monophosphate
    (AMP) and, to a lesser extent, inosine 5''-monophosphate (IMP). In contrast, under
    phosphate-limited conditions, T. pseudonana had higher concentrations of adenine,
    inosine, and adenosine all of which lack phosphate moieties. Furthermore, based
    on previously published transcriptomics data, T. pseudonana differentially regulates
    select genes that can alter these nucleic acid precursors through the gain or
    loss of the phosphate moiety. Thus, our analysis of the metabolomics and transcriptomics
    data converged upon the sensitivity of the purine biochemical pathway to phosphorus
    availability.

    \ in barley\nDescription: <p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> Genomic prediction (GP)\
    \ based on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) has become a broadly used tool\
    \ to increase the gain of selection in plant breeding. However, using predictors\
    \ that are biologically closer to the phenotypes such as transcriptome and metabolome\
    \ may increase the prediction ability in GP. The objectives of this study were\
    \ to (i) assess the prediction ability for three phenotypic traits using different\
    \ omic datasets including sequence variants (SV), deleterious SV (dSV), tolerant\
    \ SV (tSV), expression presence/absence variation (ePAV), gene expression (GE),\
    \ transcript expression (TE), and metabolites (M) as single predictors in comparison\
    \ to those using a SNP array; (ii) investigate the improvement in prediction ability\
    \ when combining multiple omic datasets information to predict phenotypic variation\
    \ in barley breeding programs; (iii) explore the relationship between genes and\
    \ metabolites to unravel the metabolic pathway of the three above mentioned phenotypic\
    \ traits.</p><p><strong>RESULTS:</strong> The prediction ability from genomic\
    \ best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP) for the three traits using dSV information\
    \ was higher than when using tSV, all SV information, or the SNP array. Any predictors\
    \ from the transcriptome (GE, TE, as well as ePAV) and metabolome provided higher\
    \ prediction abilities compared to the SNP array and SV on average across the\
    \ three traits. In addition, some (di)-similarity existed between different omic\
    \ datasets, and therefore provided complementary biological perspectives to phenotypic\
    \ variation. Optimal combining the information of dSV, TE, ePAV, as well as metabolites\
    \ into GP models could improve the prediction ability over that of the single\
    \ predictors alone.</p><p><strong>CONCLUSIONS:</strong> The use of integrated\
    \ omic datasets in GP model is highly recommended. Furthermore, we evaluated a\
    \ cost-effective approach generating 3\u2019end mRNA sequencing with transcriptome\
    \ data extracted from seedling without losing prediction ability in comparison\
    \ to the full-length mRNA sequencing, paving the path for the use of such prediction\

      \ the gain of selection in plant breeding. However, using predictors that are\
      \ biologically closer to the phenotypes such as transcriptome and metabolome\
      \ may increase the prediction ability in GP. The objectives of this study were\
      \ to (i) assess the prediction ability for three phenotypic traits using different\
      \ omic datasets including sequence variants (SV), deleterious SV (dSV), tolerant\
      \ SV (tSV), expression presence/absence variation (ePAV), gene expression (GE),\
      \ transcript expression (TE), and metabolites (M) as single predictors in comparison\
      \ to those using a SNP array; (ii) investigate the improvement in prediction\
      \ ability when combining multiple omic datasets information to predict phenotypic\
      \ variation in barley breeding programs; (iii) explore the relationship between\
      \ genes and metabolites to unravel the metabolic pathway of the three above\
      \ mentioned phenotypic traits.</p><p><strong>RESULTS:</strong> The prediction\
      \ ability from genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP) for the three\
      \ traits using dSV information was higher than when using tSV, all SV information,\
      \ or the SNP array. Any predictors from the transcriptome (GE, TE, as well as\
      \ ePAV) and metabolome provided higher prediction abilities compared to the\
      \ SNP array and SV on average across the three traits. In addition, some (di)-similarity\
      \ existed between different omic datasets, and therefore provided complementary\
      \ biological perspectives to phenotypic variation. Optimal combining the information\
      \ of dSV, TE, ePAV, as well as metabolites into GP models could improve the\
      \ prediction ability over that of the single predictors alone.</p><p><strong>CONCLUSIONS:</strong>\
      \ The use of integrated omic datasets in GP model is highly recommended. Furthermore,\
      \ we evaluated a cost-effective approach generating 3\u2019end mRNA sequencing\
      \ with transcriptome data extracted from seedling without losing prediction\
      \ ability in comparison to the full-length mRNA sequencing, paving the path\
      \ for the use of such prediction methods in commercial breeding programs.</p>"

    metabolite analysis (FIA-MS) (C.saccharolyticum;E.coli;L.plantarum;L.lactis;S.salivarius

    Description: <p>Bacteria in the gut can modulate the availability and efficacy
    of therapeutic drugs. Interactions at this level have only recently started to
    being systematically mapped and the main underlying mechanism proposed is chemical
    transformation of drugs by microbes (biotransformation). Here, we investigated
    the depletion of 15 structurally diverse drugs by 25 representative gut bacterial
    strains. This revealed 70 bacteria-drug interactions, 29 of which had not been
    reported before.</p><p>Over half of the new interactions can be ascribed to bioaccumulation,
    that is bacteria storing the drug without chemically modifying it, and in most
    cases without their growth being affected. As a case in point, we studied the
    molecular basis of bioaccumulation of the widely used antidepressant duloxetine
    by using click-chemistry, thermal proteome profiling and metabolomics. We find
    that duloxetine binds to several metabolic enzymes and changes metabolite secretion
    of the respective bacteria. When tested in a defined microbial community of accumulators
    and non-accumulators, duloxetine markedly altered the community composition through
    metabolic cross-feeding. We further validated our findings in an animal model,
    showing that bioaccumulating bacteria attenuate the behavioral response of Caenorhabditis
    elegans to duloxetine.</p><p>Taken together, bioaccumulation by gut bacteria might
    be a common mechanism that alters drug availability and bacterial metabolism,

    (GC-MS assay; Wood ring and extraxylary tissue)

    Description: <p>Wood, or secondary xylem, is the product of xylogenesis, a developmental
    process that begins with the proliferation of cambial derivatives and ends with
    mature xylem fibers and vessels with lignified secondary cell walls. Fully mature
    xylem has undergone a series of cellular processes, including cell division, cell
    expansion, secondary wall formation, lignification and programmed cell death.
    A complex network of interactions between transcriptional regulators and signal
    transduction pathways controls wood formation. However, the role of metabolites
    during this developmental process has not been comprehensively characterized.
    To evaluate the role of metabolites during wood formation, we performed a high
    spatial resolution metabolomics study of the wood-forming zone of Populus tremula,
    including laser dissected aspen ray and fiber cells. We show that metabolites
    show specific patterns within the wood-forming zone, following the differentiation
    process from cell division to cell death. The data from profiled laser dissected
    aspen ray and fiber cells suggests that these two cell types host distinctly different
    metabolic processes. Furthermore, by integrating previously published transcriptomic
    and proteomic profiles generated from the same trees, we provide an integrative
    picture of molecular processes, for example, deamination of phenylalanine during
    lignification is of critical importance for nitrogen metabolism during wood formation.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>GC-MS

    Large-Scale Multianalyte Metabolomics Platform

    Description: The exposome, defined as the cumulative measure of external exposures
    and associated biological responses throughout the lifespan, has emerged in recent
    years as a cornerstone in biomedical sciences. Metabolomics stands out here as
    one of the most powerful tools for investigating the interplay between the genetic
    background, exogenous, and endogenous factors within human health. However, to
    address the complexity of the exposome, novel methods are needed to characterize
    the human metabolome. In this work, we have optimized and validated a multianalyte
    metabolomics platform for large-scale quantitative exposome research in plasma
    and urine samples, based on the use of simple extraction methods and high-throughput
    metabolomic fingerprinting. The methodology enables, for the first time, the simultaneous
    characterization of the endogenous metabolome, food-related metabolites, pharmaceuticals,
    household chemicals, environmental pollutants, and microbiota derivatives, comprising
    more than 1000 metabolites in total. This comprehensive and quantitative investigation
    of the exposome is achieved in short run times, through simple extraction methods
    requiring small-sample volumes, and using integrated quality control procedures
    for ensuring data quality. This metabolomics approach was satisfactorily validated
    in terms of linearity, recovery, matrix effects, specificity, limits of quantification,
    intraday and interday precision, and carryover. Furthermore, the clinical potential
    of the methodology was demonstrated in a dietary intervention trial as a case
    study. In summary, this study describes the optimization, validation, and application
    of a multimetabolite platform for comprehensive and quantitative metabolomics-based
    exposome research with great utility in large-scale epidemiological studies.

- input: 'Title: The use of metabolomics to monitor simultaneous changes in metabolic
    variables following supramaximal low volume high intensity exercise

    Description: High intensity exercise (HIE) stimulates greater physiological remodeling
    when compared to workload matched low-moderate intensity exercise. This study
    utilized an untargeted metabolomics approach to examine the metabolic perturbations
    that occur following two workload matched supramaximal low volume HIE trials.
    In a randomized order, 7 untrained males completed two exercise protocols separated
    by 1 week; (1) HIE150%: 30 x 20 s cycling at 150% VO2peak, 40 s passive rest;
    (2) HIE300%: 30 x 10 s cycling at 300% VO2peak, 50 s passive rest. Total exercise
    duration was 30 min for both trials. Blood samples were taken at rest, during
    and immediately following exercise and at 60 min post exercise. Gas chromatography-mass
    spectrometry analysis of plasma identified 43 known metabolites of which 3 demonstrated
    significant fold changes (HIE300% compared to the HIE150% value) during exercise,
    14 post exercise and 23 at the end of the recovery period. Significant changes
    in plasma metabolites relating to lipid metabolism [fatty acids: dodecanoate (p=0.042),
    hexadecanoate (p=0.001), octadecanoate (p=0.001)], total cholesterol (p=0.001),
    and glycolysis [lactate (p=0.018)] were observed following exercise and during
    the recovery period. The HIE300% protocol elicited greater metabolic changes relating
    to lipid metabolism and glycolysis when compared to HIE150% protocol. These changes
    were more pronounced throughout the recovery period rather than during the exercise

    study: The use of metabolomics to monitor simultaneous changes in metabolic variables
      following supramaximal low volume high intensity exercise
    description: 'High intensity exercise (HIE) stimulates greater physiological remodeling
      when compared to workload matched low-moderate intensity exercise. This study
      utilized an untargeted metabolomics approach to examine the metabolic perturbations
      that occur following two workload matched supramaximal low volume HIE trials.
      In a randomized order, 7 untrained males completed two exercise protocols separated
      by 1 week; (1) HIE150%: 30 x 20 s cycling at 150% VO2peak, 40 s passive rest;
      (2) HIE300%: 30 x 10 s cycling at 300% VO2peak, 50 s passive rest. Total exercise
      duration was 30 min for both trials. Blood samples were taken at rest, during
      and immediately following exercise and at 60 min post exercise. Gas chromatography-mass
      spectrometry analysis of plasma identified 43 known metabolites of which 3 demonstrated
      significant fold changes (HIE300% compared to the HIE150% value) during exercise,
      14 post exercise and 23 at the end of the recovery period. Significant changes
      in plasma metabolites relating to lipid metabolism [fatty acids: dodecanoate
      (p=0.042), hexadecanoate (p=0.001), octadecanoate (p=0.001)], total cholesterol
      (p=0.001), and glycolysis [lactate (p=0.018)] were observed following exercise
      and during the recovery period. The HIE300% protocol elicited greater metabolic
      changes relating to lipid metabolism and glycolysis when compared to HIE150%
      protocol. These changes were more pronounced throughout the recovery period
      rather than during the exercise bout itself. Data from the current study demonstrate
      the use of metabolomics to monitor intensity-dependent changes in multiple metabolic
      pathways following exercise. The small sample size indicates a need for further
      studies in a larger sample cohort to validate these findings.'

    study: Proteomic analysis validates previous findings on wounding-responsive plant
      hormone signaling and primary metabolism contributing to the biosynthesis of
      secondary metabolites based on metabolomic analysis in harvested broccoli (Brassica
      oleracea L. var. italica)
    description: "The plant wound-response is a complex process that generates physiological\
      \ modi\uFB01cations for protecting the wounded tissue. In this study, tandem\
      \ mass tag (TMT)-based quantitative proteomic analysis was performed to clarify\
      \ the comprehensive molecular mechanism for the wound-response of broccoli subjected\
      \ to two wounding intensities (0.04 and 1.85 m2 kg\u22121 for florets and shreds,\
      \ respectively). Furthermore, integrated proteomic and metabolomic analysis\
      \ was performed to reveal the interaction among the critical metabolic pathway\
      \ responses to wounding. The results show that a total of 399 proteins and 266\
      \ proteins were identified as differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in florets\
      \ and shreds broccoli compared to control, respectively. Bioinformatic analysis\
      \ indicated that the DEPs were mainly involved in metabolism, genetic information\
      \ processing, cellular process, environmental information processing and organismal\
      \ systems. Salicylic acid (SA) and ethylene (ET) biosynthesis were more susceptible\
      \ to being induced by wounding with lower intensities, whereas, jasmonic acid\
      \ (JA) biosynthesis was more susceptible to being activated by wounding with\
      \ higher intensities. Some carbohydrate metabolic pathways and amino acid biosynthesis-related\
      \ pathways such as phenylalanine, cysteine and methionine metabolic pathways\
      \ were significantly up-regulated, which promotes the precursor levels for phenolic\
      \ substances and glucosinolate synthesis. Biosynthesis of secondary metabolites\
      \ was activated by wounding through regulation of critical proteins involved\
      \ in the corresponding metabolic pathways."

    untargeted metabolomics

    Description: Tomatoes are one of the most consumed vegetables in the United States,
    making them an economically and nutritionally important crop. Previous epidemiological
    and intervention studies have suggested positive health outcomes associated with
    tomato consumption. To more conclusively understand the relationship between tomato
    intake and health benefits, an accurate measurement of tomato consumption is required.
    Current methods rely on self-report dietary assessments which suffer from recall
    bias or, plasma lycopene analysis which lacks reliability. Urine sampling allows
    an objective, non- invasive assessment of dietary intake, resulting in a more
    robust determination of consumption. Untargeted metabolomics allows for detection
    of differences in small molecules between groups without preconceived bias, allowing
    for several classes of compounds to be evaluated as potential biomarkers. The
    objective of this study was to discover putative urinary biomarkers of tomato
    consumption using untargeted metabolomics. Healthy subjects (n=11) were evaluated
    on two separate days: on each day they consumed a controlled diet with either
    red or tangerine tomato juice with breakfast. Two varieties of tomato juices were
    included in order to understand how variation in tomato source contributes to
    intake biomarkers observed. Urine was collected at baseline, 3, 6, 9, 12, and
    24 hours. UHPLC-QTOF-MS was used to compare osmolality-normalized urine samples
    at each time point. Data was collected in both positive and negative modes for
    comprehensive coverage of metabolites. Raw data was processed using MZmine2. Univariate
    and multivariate statistical approaches were applied to understand which metabolites
    were significantly different between urine pre- and-post-tomato consumption. Feature
    lists were reduced to those that met all three of the following criteria: the
    compound was significantly different (p<0.05) at every timepoint compared to baseline;
    the compound had a fold change greater than 2 at every timepoint compared to baseline;
    the compound had a VIP score greater than 1 for the Partial Least Squares Regression
    model. We found 99 metabolites in ESI (+) and 46 metabolites in ESI (-) that met
    these criteria. Online databases were consulted as a first attempt at identifying
    unknown compounds. Data-independent MS/MS analysis was conducted to generate fragmentation
    patterns to support feature identification. Authentic standards for naringenin-4-O-glucuronide
    and naringenin-7-O-glucuronide confirmed their identities in both modes compared
    to pooled 6 hour urine. Previously reported compounds in urine after tomato consumption,
    N-caprylhistidinol and N-caprylhistidinol glucuronide were also identified in
    positive mode with a level 2 confidence, giving more support for future investigation
    into these compounds as biomarkers. Several compounds from the features of interest
    reduced lists could be tentatively identified as metabolites that had undergone
    phase II reactions prior to urinary excretion. Additional studies will need to
    be done to test the robustness, analytical performance, stability, and reliability
    of these compounds.

    Description: Animal African Trypanosomiasis (AAT) is a debilitating livestock

    parasite Trypanosoma congolense. In comparison to the well-studied T. brucei,
    there is a major paucity of knowledge regarding the biology of T. congolense.
    Here, we use a combination of omics technologies and novel genetic tools to characterise
    core metabolism in T. congolense mammalian-infective bloodstream-form parasites,
    and test whether metabolic differences compared to T. brucei impact upon sensitivity
    to metabolic inhibition. Like the bloodstream stage of T. brucei, glycolysis plays
    a major part in T. congolense energy metabolism. However, the rate of glucose
    uptake is significantly lower in bloodstream stage T. congolense, with cells remaining
    viable when cultured in concentrations as low as 2 mM. Instead of pyruvate, the
    primary glycolytic endpoints are succinate, malate and acetate. Transcriptomics
    analysis showed higher levels of transcripts associated with the mitochondrial
    pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, acetate generation, and the glycosomal succinate
    shunt in T. congolense, compared to T. brucei. Stable-isotope labelling of glucose
    enabled the comparison of carbon usage between T. brucei and T. congolense, highlighting
    differences in nucleotide and saturated fatty acid metabolism. To validate the
    metabolic similarities and differences, both species were treated with metabolic
    inhibitors, confirming that electron transport chain activity is not essential
    in T. congolense. However, the parasite exhibits increased sensitivity to inhibition
    of mitochondrial pyruvate import, compared to T. brucei. Strikingly, T. congolense
    exhibited significant resistance to inhibitors of fatty acid synthesis, including
    a 780-fold higher EC50 for the lipase and fatty acid synthase inhibitor Orlistat,
    compared to T. brucei. These data highlight that bloodstream form T. congolense
    diverges from T. brucei in key areas of metabolism, with several features that
    are intermediate between bloodstream- and insect-stage T. brucei. These results
    have implications for drug development, mechanisms of drug resistance and host-pathogen
    interactions.

    study: Divergent metabolism between Trypanosoma congolense and Trypanosoma brucei
      results in differential sensitivity to metabolic inhibition
    description: Animal African Trypanosomiasis (AAT) is a debilitating livestock
      disease prevalent across sub-Saharan Africa, a main cause of which is the protozoan
      parasite Trypanosoma congolense. In comparison to the well-studied T. brucei,
      there is a major paucity of knowledge regarding the biology of T. congolense.
      Here, we use a combination of omics technologies and novel genetic tools to
      characterise core metabolism in T. congolense mammalian-infective bloodstream-form
      parasites, and test whether metabolic differences compared to T. brucei impact
      upon sensitivity to metabolic inhibition. Like the bloodstream stage of T. brucei,
      glycolysis plays a major part in T. congolense energy metabolism. However, the
      rate of glucose uptake is significantly lower in bloodstream stage T. congolense,
      with cells remaining viable when cultured in concentrations as low as 2 mM.
      Instead of pyruvate, the primary glycolytic endpoints are succinate, malate
      and acetate. Transcriptomics analysis showed higher levels of transcripts associated
      with the mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, acetate generation, and
      the glycosomal succinate shunt in T. congolense, compared to T. brucei. Stable-isotope
      labelling of glucose enabled the comparison of carbon usage between T. brucei
      and T. congolense, highlighting differences in nucleotide and saturated fatty
      acid metabolism. To validate the metabolic similarities and differences, both
      species were treated with metabolic inhibitors, confirming that electron transport
      chain activity is not essential in T. congolense. However, the parasite exhibits
      increased sensitivity to inhibition of mitochondrial pyruvate import, compared

    Description: Atypical myopathy (AM) is a severe rhabdomyolysis syndrome that occurs
    in grazing horses. Despite the presence of toxins in their blood, all horses from
    the same pasture are not prone to display clinical signs of AM. The objective
    of this study was to compare the blood metabolomic profiles of horses with AM
    clinical signs with those of healthy co-grazing (Co-G) horses. To do so, plasma
    samples from 5 AM horses and 11 Co-G horses were investigated using untargeted
    metabolomics. Metabolomic data were evaluated using unsupervised, supervised,
    and pathway analyses. Unsupervised principal component analysis performed with
    all detected features separated AM and healthy Co-G horses. Supervised analyses
    had identified 1276 features showing differential expression between both groups.
    Among them, 46 metabolites, belonging predominantly to the fatty acid, fatty ester,
    and amino acid chemical classes, were identified by standard comparison. Fatty
    acids, unsaturated fatty acids, organic dicarboxylic acids, and fatty esters were
    detected with higher intensities in AM horses in link with the toxins'' pathological
    mechanism. The main relevant pathways were lipid metabolism; valine, leucine,
    and isoleucine metabolism; and glycine metabolism. This study revealed characteristic
    metabolite changes in the plasma of clinically affected horses, which might ultimately
    help scientists and field veterinarians to detect and manage AM. The raw data

    study: Metabolomic signatures discriminate horses with clinical signs of atypical
      myopathy from healthy co-grazing horses
    description: Atypical myopathy (AM) is a severe rhabdomyolysis syndrome that occurs
      in grazing horses. Despite the presence of toxins in their blood, all horses
      from the same pasture are not prone to display clinical signs of AM. The objective
      of this study was to compare the blood metabolomic profiles of horses with AM
      clinical signs with those of healthy co-grazing (Co-G) horses. To do so, plasma
      samples from 5 AM horses and 11 Co-G horses were investigated using untargeted
      metabolomics. Metabolomic data were evaluated using unsupervised, supervised,
      and pathway analyses. Unsupervised principal component analysis performed with
      all detected features separated AM and healthy Co-G horses. Supervised analyses
      had identified 1276 features showing differential expression between both groups.
      Among them, 46 metabolites, belonging predominantly to the fatty acid, fatty
      ester, and amino acid chemical classes, were identified by standard comparison.
      Fatty acids, unsaturated fatty acids, organic dicarboxylic acids, and fatty
      esters were detected with higher intensities in AM horses in link with the toxins'
      pathological mechanism. The main relevant pathways were lipid metabolism; valine,
      leucine, and isoleucine metabolism; and glycine metabolism. This study revealed
      characteristic metabolite changes in the plasma of clinically affected horses,
      which might ultimately help scientists and field veterinarians to detect and
      manage AM. The raw data of metabolomics are available in the MetaboLights database
      with the access number MTBLS2579.

    \ irritable bowel syndrome and depression comorbidity\nDescription: <p>Irritable\
    \ bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the functional gastrointestinal disorders characterized\
    \ by chronic and/or recurrent symptoms of abdominal pain and irregular defecation.\
    \ Changed gut microbiota has been proposed to mediate IBS; however, contradictory\
    \ results exist, and IBS-specific microbiota, metabolites, and their interactions\
    \ remain poorly understood. To address this issue, we performed metabolomic and\
    \ metagenomic profiling of stool and serum samples based on discovery (<em>n</em>\u2009\
    =\u2009330) and validation (<em>n</em>\u2009=\u2009101) cohorts. Fecal metagenomic\
    \ data showed moderate dysbiosis compared with other diseases, in contrast, serum\
    \ metabolites showed significant differences with greater power to distinguish\
    \ IBS patients from healthy controls. Specifically, 726 differentially abundant\
    \ serum metabolites were identified, including a cluster of fatty acyl-CoAs enriched\
    \ in IBS. We further identified 522 robust associations between differentially\
    \ abundant gut bacteria and fecal metabolites, of which three species including&nbsp;<em>Odoribacter\
    \ splanchnicus</em>,&nbsp;<em>Escherichia coli</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Ruminococcus\
    \ gnavus</em>&nbsp;were strongly associated with the low abundance of dihydropteroic\
    \ acid. Moreover, dysregulated tryptophan/serotonin metabolism was found to be\
    \ correlated with the severity of IBS depression in both fecal and serum metabolomes,\
    \ characterized by a shift in tryptophan metabolism towards kynurenine production.\
    \ Collectively, our study revealed serum/fecal metabolome alterations and their\
    \ relationship with gut microbiome, highlighted the massive alterations of serum\
    \ metabolites, which empower to recognize IBS patients, suggested potential roles\
    \ of metabolic dysregulation in IBS pathogenesis, and offered new clues to understand\
    \ IBS depression comorbidity. Our study provided a valuable resource for future\
    \ studies, and would facilitate potential clinical applications of IBS featured\

    Description: Panax ginseng roots are well known for their medicinal properties

    However, the medicinal value of P. ginseng fruits remain poorly characterized.
    Using gas chromatography-time of flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF MS), 66 metabolites
    including amino acids, sugars, organic acids, phenolic acids, phytosterols, tocopherols,
    and policosanols were identified and quantified. Some of these are well known
    medicinal compounds and were not previously identified in ginseng. Interestingly,
    the concentration of almost all metabolites was higher in the Chunpoong and Gumpoong
    cultivars. Parallel comparison of the four cultivars also revealed higher amounts
    of the medicinal metabolites in Chunpoong and Gumpoong cultivars. Taken together,

      \ were not resolved) despite a significant increase in the production of a cell\

      \ Conclusions: This work provides the first insight into the mechanism of action\
      \ of yerba mate extract on S. Typhimurium by revealing a major impact on central\
      \ carbon metabolism, catalase activity, and possible metabolic links to interference\
      \ in energy production and membrane integrity. The putative identification of\
      \ the antibacterial compound yohimbine and the many unidentified compounds provides\
      \ additional avenues for future investigations of novel yerba mate compounds\
      \ capable of traversing or binding to S. Typhimurium\u2019s membrane."

    Description: Renal interstitial fibrosis is a common pathological process in the
    progression of kidney disease. A nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) based metabolomics
    approach was used to analyze the kidney tissues of renal interstitial fibrosis
    (RIF) rats, induced by unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO). The combination
    of a variety of statistical methods was used to screen out 14 significantly changed
    potential metabolites related with multiple biochemical processes including amino
    acid metabolism, adenine metabolism, energy metabolism, osmolyte change and induced
    oxidative stress. The exploration of the contralateral kidneys enhanced the understanding
    of the disease, which was also supported by serum biochemistry and kidney histopathology
    results. In addition, the pathological parameters (clinical chemistry, histological
    and immunohistochemistry results) were correlated with the significantly changed
    differential metabolites related with RIF. This study shows that target tissue
    metabolomics analysis can be used as a useful tool to understand the mechanism
    of the disease and provide a novel insight in the pathogenesis of RIF.

    Description: <p>The composition and changes of the fungal population and of the

    one of the major components of the Amarone musts, were dissected aiming at the
    identification of constant characteristics possibly influenced by the productive
    process. The fungal populations and metabolomic profiles were analyzed in three
    different vintages. 454-pyrosequencing on the ribosomal ITS1 region has been used
    to identify the fungal population present in Corvina grapes and fresh must. Samples
    were also subjected to metabolomics analysis measuring both free volatile compounds
    and glycosylated aroma precursors through an untargeted approach with comprehensive
    two-dimensional gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Albeit strongly
    dependent on the climate, both the mycobiota and metabolome of Corvina grapes
    and fresh musts show some characteristics recursive in different vintages. Such
    persistent characteristics are likely determined by the method adopted to produce
    Amarone or other dry wines made from partially dried grapes. In particular, the
    harsh conditions imposed by the prolonged withering appear to contribute to the
    shaping of the fungal populations. The fungal genera and metabolites present in
    different vintages in V. vinifera L. cv. Corvina grapes and fresh musts represent
    core components of the peculiar technique of production of Amarone. Their identification

    protein and lipid composition

    Description: <h4><strong>Summary</strong></h4><p>Primary cilia are key sensory
    organelles whose dysfunction leads to ciliopathy disorders such as Bardet-Biedl
    syndrome (BBS). Retinal degeneration is common in ciliopathies, since the outer
    segments (OSs) of photoreceptors are highly specialized primary cilia. BBS1, encoded
    by the most commonly mutated BBS-associated gene, is part of the BBSome protein
    complex. Using a new bbs1 zebrafish mutant, we show that retinal development and
    photoreceptor differentiation are unaffected by Bbs1-loss, supported by an initially
    unaffected transcriptome. Quantitative proteomics and lipidomics on isolated OSs
    show that Bbs1 is required for BBSome-entry into OSs and that Bbs1-loss leads
    to accumulation of membrane-associated proteins in OSs, with enrichment in proteins
    involved in lipid homeostasis. Disruption of the tightly regulated OS lipid composition
    with increased OS cholesterol content are paralleled by early functional visual
    deficits, which precede progressive OS morphological anomalies. Our findings identify
    a new role for Bbs1/BBSome in OS lipid homeostasis and suggest a new pathomechanism

    aimed to expand the baseline knowledge of using metabolic end points in environmental

    was measured using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and mussel tissue
    chemical contaminants were analyzed using gas or liquid chromatography coupled
    with mass spectrometry. All Maumee River sites had a distinct mussel metabolome
    compared to the reference site and revealed changes in the energy metabolism and
    amino acids. Data also highlighted the importance of considering seasonality or
    handling effects on the metabolome at the time of sampling. The furthest upstream
    site presented a specific mussel tissue chemical signature of pesticides (atrazine
    and metolachlor), while a downstream site, located at Toledo''s wastewater treatment
    plant, was characterized by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and other organic
    contaminants. Further research into the dreissenid mussel''s natural metabolic

    and survival

    Description: Surprisingly little is known about the critical metabolic changes
    that neural cells have to undergo during development and how even mild, temporary
    shifts in this program can influence brain circuitries and behavior. Inspired
    by the discovery that mutations in SLC7A5, a transporter of metabolically-essential
    large neutral amino acids (LNAAs), lead to autism, we employed metabolomic profiling
    to study the metabolic states of the cerebral cortex across different developmental
    stages. We found that the forebrain undergoes significant metabolic remodeling
    throughout development, with certain groups of metabolites showing stage-specific
    changes. But what are the consequences of interfering with this metabolic program?
    By manipulating Slc7a5 expression in neural cells, we found that the metabolism
    of LNAAs and lipids are interconnected in the cortex. Deletion of Slc7a5 in neurons
    perturbs specifically the postnatal metabolic state leading to a shift in lipid
    metabolism and a stage- and cell- type-specific alteration in neuronal activity
    patterns, resulting in a long-term circuit dysfunction.

    and survival

    Description: Surprisingly little is known about the critical metabolic changes
    that neural cells have to undergo during development and how even mild, temporary
    shifts in this program can influence brain circuitries and behavior. Inspired
    by the discovery that mutations in SLC7A5, a transporter of metabolically-essential
    large neutral amino acids (LNAAs), lead to autism, we employed metabolomic profiling
    to study the metabolic states of the cerebral cortex across different developmental
    stages. We found that the forebrain undergoes significant metabolic remodeling
    throughout development, with certain groups of metabolites showing stage-specific
    changes. But what are the consequences of interfering with this metabolic program?
    By manipulating Slc7a5 expression in neural cells, we found that the metabolism
    of LNAAs and lipids are interconnected in the cortex. Deletion of Slc7a5 in neurons
    perturbs specifically the postnatal metabolic state leading to a shift in lipid
    metabolism and a stage- and cell- type-specific alteration in neuronal activity
    patterns, resulting in a long-term circuit dysfunction.

      that neural cells have to undergo during development and how even mild, temporary
      shifts in this program can influence brain circuitries and behavior. Inspired
      by the discovery that mutations in SLC7A5, a transporter of metabolically-essential
      large neutral amino acids (LNAAs), lead to autism, we employed metabolomic profiling
      to study the metabolic states of the cerebral cortex across different developmental
      stages. We found that the forebrain undergoes significant metabolic remodeling
      throughout development, with certain groups of metabolites showing stage-specific
      changes. But what are the consequences of interfering with this metabolic program?
      By manipulating Slc7a5 expression in neural cells, we found that the metabolism
      of LNAAs and lipids are interconnected in the cortex. Deletion of Slc7a5 in
      neurons perturbs specifically the postnatal metabolic state leading to a shift
      in lipid metabolism and a stage- and cell- type-specific alteration in neuronal
      activity patterns, resulting in a long-term circuit dysfunction.

    and survival

    Description: Surprisingly little is known about the critical metabolic changes
    that neural cells have to undergo during development and how even mild, temporary
    shifts in this program can influence brain circuitries and behavior. Inspired
    by the discovery that mutations in SLC7A5, a transporter of metabolically-essential
    large neutral amino acids (LNAAs), lead to autism, we employed metabolomic profiling
    to study the metabolic states of the cerebral cortex across different developmental
    stages. We found that the forebrain undergoes significant metabolic remodeling
    throughout development, with certain groups of metabolites showing stage-specific
    changes. But what are the consequences of interfering with this metabolic program?
    By manipulating Slc7a5 expression in neural cells, we found that the metabolism
    of LNAAs and lipids are interconnected in the cortex. Deletion of Slc7a5 in neurons
    perturbs specifically the postnatal metabolic state leading to a shift in lipid
    metabolism and a stage- and cell- type-specific alteration in neuronal activity
    patterns, resulting in a long-term circuit dysfunction.

    We investigate color morph-enriched Asian vine snakes (<em>Ahaetulla prasina</em>),

    association study and RNA sequencing reveal a conservative amino acid substitution
    (p.P20S) in <em>SMARCE1</em>, which may be involved in the regulation of chromatophore
    development initiated from neural crest cells. <em>SMARCE1</em> knockdown in zebrafish

    Description: The diversity and number of species present within microbial communities
    create the potential for a multitude of interspecies metabolic interactions. Here,
    we develop, apply, and experimentally test a framework for inferring metabolic
    mechanisms associated with interspecies interactions. We perform pairwise growth
    and metabolome profiling of co-cultures of strains from a model mouse microbiota.
    We then apply our framework to dissect emergent metabolic behaviors that occur
    in co-culture. Based on one of the inferences from this framework, we identify
    and interrogate an amino acid cross-feeding interaction and validate that the
    proposed interaction leads to a growth benefit in vitro. Our results reveal the
    type and extent of emergent metabolic behavior in microbial communities composed
    of gut microbes. We focus on growth-modulating interactions, but the framework
    can be applied to interspecies interactions that modulate any phenotype of interest
    within microbial communities.

    \ conditioning programs involving exercise sessions of various types, distances\
    \ and intensities. These programs aim to optimize both their physical and mental\
    \ capabilities, which are essential to achieve maximal performance. Conventional\

    \ study was conducted to comprehensively assess the metabolic responses triggered\
    \ by exercise sessions routinely used in TB conditioning. To accomplish this,\
    \ we employed an untargeted metabolomics approach. Blood samples were collected\
    \ from 10 racehorses at rest and after completing a routine exercise session.\
    \ The population was subsequently divided into two groups based on the intensity\
    \ of the exercise performed: a high-intensity group (n = 6, gallop at \xB1 13.38\
    \ m/s, 1400 m) and a moderate-intensity group (n = 4, soft canter at \xB1 7.63\
    \ m/s, 2500 m). The exercise intensity was evaluated through monitoring of speed,\
    \ heart rate, and targeted hematological and biochemical parameters (e.g., lactatemia,\
    \ hematocrit, etc). Resting and 30 min post-exercise plasma samples were analyzed\
    \ using an untargeted metabolomics approach based on ultra-performance liquid\

    and genes expression of aroma-related enzymes in oriental melon fruit

    Description: <p>Grafting is widely applied in the cultivation of melon. In this
    study, ''Qinmi No.1'' [<em>Cucumis melo </em>L.<em> </em>(QG)] and ''Ribenxuesong''
    [<em>Cucurbita maxima</em> Duch. (RG)] were used as rootstocks for ''QingxinYangjiaocui''
    (<em>Cucumis melo</em> L.). The results showed that grafting with muskmelon rootstocks
    had no significant effect on fruit aroma, but grafting with pumpkin rootstocks
    significantly reduced the odor intensity and odor preference scores of melon fruits.
    Compared with the fruits from self-grafted plants (SG), four new aromatic volatiles
    with a sweet smell were detected, the alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) activity was
    significantly decreased at 30 DAP, but unaffected at 42 DAP in QG fruits. There
    was no difference for alcohol acetyltransferase (AAT) activity between QG and
    SG fruits. The expression level of CmADH2 was significantly higher at 30 DAP and
    42 DAP, but CmAAT2 was significantly lower at 42 DAP in QG fruits compared with
    SG fruits. In RG fruits, the main aroma compounds including butanoic acid ethyl
    ester, 2-methyl-2-butenal and 2-methylheptan-1-al were absent, while the volatile
    compounds with unpleasant odor characteristics including trans, cis-2,6-nonadien-1-ol,
    (E,E)-2,4-heptadienal, octanoic acid and styrene were detected. Compared with
    SG fruits, 1-nonanol and 1-heptanol with green odor characteristics were significantly
    increased, but eucalyptol and farnesene with fruity aroma characteristics were
    significantly decreased in RG fruits. The ADH activity of RG fruits was significantly
    lower than that of SG fruits at 30 DAP and the AAT activity was significantly
    lower than that of SG fruits at 42 DAP. In addition, the expression levels of
    CmADH and CmAAT homologs in RG fruits were significantly lower than those in SG
    or QG fruits. These results show that grafting with pumpkin rootstocks affected
    the main aroma components, reduced ADH and AAT activities, and down-regulated
    the expression levels of CmADHs and CmAATs in the melon fruits. This study reveals
    the mechanism of different rootstocks on melon fruit aroma quality, and lays a
    theoretical foundation for the selection of rootstocks in melon production. Future
    studies using overexpression or CRISPR/CAS system to obtain stable transgenic
    lines of genes encoding key aromatic volatiles, would be promising to effectively
    improve the flavor quality of melon.</p>

- input: 'Title: The accumulation profiles of terpene metabolites in three Muscat
    table grape cultivars through HS-SPME-GCMS

    Description: Aroma is an important parameter for table grapes and wines; terpenes
    are typical compounds in Muscat-type grape cultivars and can be easily perceived
    by humans because of their low olfactory threshold. Volatile terpenes contribute
    directly to the aroma character, while glycoside-bound terpenes are potential
    aromatic compounds and can be changed to their volatile forms via hydrolysis.
    With gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and a solid-phase microextraction method,
    an automatic data analysis platform was constructed; terpene compounds were identified
    and quantified from three table grape cultivars at three stages during berry development,
    and the raw data were deposited in MetaboLights. Terpene metabolite accumulation
    profiles are presented in this article for integrative analysis with the transcriptome
    data and phenotypic data to elucidate the important candidate genes and mechanism
    for terpene biosynthesis. Our method has applications in the identification and
    quantification of terpene compounds with very low or trace concentrations.
