"Title: A metabolic switch orchestrated by IL-18 and the cyclic dinucleotide cGAMP programs intestinal tolerance
Description: Tissues are exposed to diverse inflammatory challenges that shape future inflammatory responses. While cellular metabolism regulates immune function, how metabolism programs and stabilizes immune states within tissues and tunes susceptibility to inflammation is poorly understood. Here, we describe an innate immune metabolic switch that programs long-term intestinal tolerance. Intestinal interleukin-18 (IL-18) stimulation elicited tolerogenic macrophages by preventing their proinflammatory glycolytic polarization via metabolic reprogramming to fatty acid oxidation (FAO). FAO reprogramming was triggered by IL-18 activation of SLC12A3 (NCC), leading to sodium influx, release of mitochondrial DNA, and activation of stimulator of interferon genes (STING). FAO was maintained in macrophages by a bistable switch that encoded memory of IL-18 stimulation and by intercellular positive feedback that sustained the production of macrophage-derived 2'3'-cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) and epithelial-derived IL-18. Thus, a tissue-reinforced metabolic switch encodes durable immune tolerance in the gut and may enable reconstructing compromised immune tolerance in chronic inflammation.

The study describes how IL-18 stimulation in the intestine leads to a metabolic reprogramming of macrophages towards fatty acid oxidation (FAO) instead of glycolysis, resulting in a tolerogenic state. The enrichment of fatty acid anions, monocarboxylic acid anions, and fatty acids is consistent with the increased FAO pathway activity. The enrichment of tricarboxylic acids could be related to the involvement of the TCA cycle in supporting FAO. 

The cation and quaternary ammonium ion enrichment could be linked to the described role of sodium influx via SLC12A3 in triggering the metabolic switch. Monosaccharides may be enriched due to potential changes in glycolytic flux or other sugar metabolism pathways affected by the metabolic reprogramming.

Overall, the enriched chemical classes align well with the described metabolic changes and mechanisms involved in establishing intestinal tolerance through FAO reprogramming in macrophages."	YES, the enrichment results make sense. The study focuses on metabolic reprogramming towards fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and how it maintains intestinal tolerance. The enriched chemical classes such as fatty acid anion, fatty acid, and fatty alcohol align with this reprogramming since FAO involves the breakdown of fatty acids. Additionally, classes like monocarboxylic acid anion and tricarboxylic acid relate to metabolic pathways and intermediates that are relevant to cellular metabolism and energy production, such as the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. The presence of monosaccharides could relate to alternative metabolic pathways and energy sources, while quaternary ammonium ions and cations can be linked to the alterations in cellular ions like sodium in the FAO process. Overall, the enriched chemical classes are consistent with the proposed mechanism of how IL-18 and cGAMP drive the metabolic switch for intestinal tolerance through FAO.	1.0	1.0	YES	Tissues are exposed to diverse inflammatory challenges that shape future inflammatory responses.

"Title: Mechanisms of hepatic steatosis in chickens: integrated analysis of the host genome, molecular phenomes and gut microbiome
Description: <p>Hepatic steatosis is the initial manifestation of abnormal liver functions and often leads to liver diseases such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in humans and fatty liver syndrome in animals. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of a large chicken population consisting of 705 adult hens by combining host genome resequencing, liver transcriptome, proteome and metabolome analysis, as well as microbial 16S rRNA gene sequencing of each gut segment. The results showed the heritability (h2 = 0.25) and duodenal microbiability (m2 = 0.26) of hepatic steatosis were relatively high, indicating a large effect of host genetics and duodenal microbiota on chicken hepatic steatosis. Individuals with hepatic steatosis had low microbiota diversity and a decreased genetic potential to process triglyceride output from hepatocytes, fatty acid Î²-oxidation activity and resistance to fatty acid peroxidation. Furthermore, we revealed a molecular network linking host genomic variants (GGA6: 5.59-5.69 Mb), hepatic gene/protein expression (PEMT, phosphatidyl-ethanolamine N-methyltransferase), metabolite abundances (folate, S-adenosylmethionine, homocysteine, phosphatidyl-ethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine) and duodenal microbes (genus Lactobacillus) to hepatic steatosis, which could provide new insights into the regulatory mechanism of fatty liver development.</p>

The enrichment includes several classes related to lipids and fatty acids, such as fatty acids, glycerophospholipids (e.g., phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine), sphingomyelins, and icosanoids. These classes are relevant as hepatic steatosis involves the accumulation of lipids, particularly triglycerides, in the liver.

The enrichment also includes classes like monosaccharides, alditols (sugar alcohols), and oligosaccharides, which could be related to the metabolic dysregulation associated with fatty liver disease.

Additionally, classes like nucleosides, nucleoside phosphates, and flavins could be linked to the molecular pathways and processes involved in hepatic steatosis, such as energy metabolism and oxidative stress.

Overall, the enriched chemical classes align with the study's focus on understanding the molecular mechanisms and metabolic dysregulation underlying hepatic steatosis in chickens."	"YES, the enrichment results make sense in the context of a study on hepatic steatosis. 

Hepatic steatosis involves the accumulation of fat in the liver, which is linked to metabolism disorders in lipids and other molecules. The presence of enriched fatty acids, glycerophospholipids, phosphatidylcholine, glycerophosphocholine, and phosphatidylethanolamine makes sense as these are all involved in lipid metabolism and are key components of cellular membranes and lipid droplets. The presence of quaternary ammonium ions, which could include molecules related to choline metabolism, is also relevant, as choline is an essential nutrient for liver function and fat metabolism.

Moreover, folate metabolism is mentioned in the study description, aligning with enriched metabolites like S-adenosylmethionine and homocysteine, which are related to methylation processes and one-carbon metabolism where folate plays a critical role.

The enrichment of other classes like dipeptides, nucleosides, and nucleoside phosphates could be associated with cellular turnover, metabolic stress responses, or signaling pathways involved in hepatic steatosis progression. Sphingomyelins and icosanoids, while not directly highlighted in the study description, are involved in cellular signaling and inflammation, processes often involved in developing liver diseases.

The integration of these different metabolic classes suggests a comprehensive disruption in metabolic pathways associated with hepatic steatosis, aligning with the complex nature of the condition as described."	1.0	1.0	YES	<p>Hepatic steatosis is the initial manifestation of abnormal liver functions and often leads to liver diseases such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in humans and fatty liver syndrome in animals.

Previous investigations have suggested that vaginal microbes and metabolites may be implicated in sPTB.

We find multiple associations between vaginal metabolites and subsequent preterm birth, and propose that several of these metabolites, including diethanolamine and ethyl glucoside, are exogenous.

We investigate these associations using metabolic models. We use machine learning models to predict sPTB risk from metabolite levels, weeks to months before birth, with good accuracy (area under receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.78). These models, which we validate using two external cohorts, are more accurate than microbiome-based and maternal covariates-based models (area under receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.55-0.59).

Corvina.

The enriched classes include various lipids (fatty alcohols, alkanes, fatty acids, fatty aldehydes, diols, prenols, fatty acid methyl esters, diterpenoids, triglycerides, diradylglycerols), which are naturally present in grape berries and can contribute to wine aroma and flavor. Monosaccharides and alditols are also expected, as grapes contain sugars and their derivatives.

The presence of short-chain and long-chain fatty acids, as well as icosanoids (oxidized metabolites of certain fatty acids), could be related to the withering process described in the study, which may induce lipid oxidation reactions.

Alkanethiols and mononitrophenols could potentially be associated with the fungal populations identified in the grapes and musts, as some fungi are known to produce these types of compounds.

Overall, the enriched chemical classes align well with the study's focus on characterizing the metabolome of grapes and musts used for producing a specific wine (Amarone), taking into account the influence of the production process and associated fungal populations."	YES. The enrichment results make sense in this study about Vitis vinifera L. cv. Corvina grapes and musts. The presence of several fatty acid-related classes (such as fatty alcohol, fatty acid, fatty aldehyde, short-chain fatty acid, and long-chain fatty acid) is expected, as fatty acids are common in grape metabolomes and important for flavor and aroma profiles, which are particularly relevant for wine production. The detection of volatile compounds like alkanes, diterpenoids, and prenols can also be anticipated, as these contribute to the aromatic complexity of grapes and wine. Furthermore, the findings of triglycerides and diradylglycerol are consistent with grape lipid compositions that impact cellular structures during the fermentation process. Lastly, the presence of saccharides and related compounds like monosaccharides and alditols is relevant to musts, as sugars are crucial to fermentation and influence the final product's sweetness and alcohol content. Overall, the enriched chemical classes align with metabolites expected in the vinification process and associated analyses.	1.0	1.0	YES	<p>The composition and changes of the fungal population and of the metabolites present in grapes and in ferments of Vitis vinifera L. cv.

"Title: Discovering potential urinary biomarkers of tomato consumption using untargeted metabolomics
Description: Tomatoes are one of the most consumed vegetables in the United States, making them an economically and nutritionally important crop. Previous epidemiological and intervention studies have suggested positive health outcomes associated with tomato consumption. To more conclusively understand the relationship between tomato intake and health benefits, an accurate measurement of tomato consumption is required. Current methods rely on self-report dietary assessments which suffer from recall bias or, plasma lycopene analysis which lacks reliability. Urine sampling allows an objective, non- invasive assessment of dietary intake, resulting in a more robust determination of consumption. Untargeted metabolomics allows for detection of differences in small molecules between groups without preconceived bias, allowing for several classes of compounds to be evaluated as potential biomarkers. The objective of this study was to discover putative urinary biomarkers of tomato consumption using untargeted metabolomics. Healthy subjects (n=11) were evaluated on two separate days: on each day they consumed a controlled diet with either red or tangerine tomato juice with breakfast. Two varieties of tomato juices were included in order to understand how variation in tomato source contributes to intake biomarkers observed. Urine was collected at baseline, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 hours. UHPLC-QTOF-MS was used to compare osmolality-normalized urine samples at each time point. Data was collected in both positive and negative modes for comprehensive coverage of metabolites. Raw data was processed using MZmine2. Univariate and multivariate statistical approaches were applied to understand which metabolites were significantly different between urine pre- and-post-tomato consumption. Feature lists were reduced to those that met all three of the following criteria: the compound was significantly different (p<0.05) at every timepoint compared to baseline; the compound had a fold change greater than 2 at every timepoint compared to baseline; the compound had a VIP score greater than 1 for the Partial Least Squares Regression model. We found 99 metabolites in ESI (+) and 46 metabolites in ESI (-) that met these criteria. Online databases were consulted as a first attempt at identifying unknown compounds. Data-independent MS/MS analysis was conducted to generate fragmentation patterns to support feature identification. Authentic standards for naringenin-4-O-glucuronide and naringenin-7-O-glucuronide confirmed their identities in both modes compared to pooled 6 hour urine. Previously reported compounds in urine after tomato consumption, N-caprylhistidinol and N-caprylhistidinol glucuronide were also identified in positive mode with a level 2 confidence, giving more support for future investigation into these compounds as biomarkers. Several compounds from the features of interest reduced lists could be tentatively identified as metabolites that had undergone phase II reactions prior to urinary excretion. Additional studies will need to be done to test the robustness, analytical performance, stability, and reliability of these compounds.

Tomatoes are known to contain various phytochemicals, including flavonoids like flavanones (e.g., naringenin), as well as carotenoids and terpenes. The study identified compounds like naringenin glucuronides, which are phase II metabolites of flavanones, suggesting that flavanones and related flavonoids could be potential biomarkers of tomato consumption. Similarly, icosanoids and diterpenoids are classes of terpenoid compounds that may be present in tomatoes and could be detected as potential biomarkers in urine after consumption. The enrichment of these chemical classes aligns with the phytochemical composition of tomatoes and the study's aim of discovering urinary biomarkers of tomato intake using untargeted metabolomics."	"YES, the enrichment results make sense. The study is focused on discovering urinary biomarkers of tomato consumption. Tomatoes contain flavonoids, including flavanones, which are phytochemicals commonly found in tomato products. Naringenin, a type of flavanone, has been confirmed in this study as a metabolite in urine after tomato consumption. This supports the observed enrichment for flavanones and flavonoids. 

While the presence of icosanoids and diterpenoids may not be as directly expected from tomato consumption, they could still be relevant. Icosanoids are typically derivatives of fatty acids and could reflect changes in the metabolic pathways related to lipid metabolism influenced by consuming tomato-associated fatty acids. Similarly, diterpenoids, although not traditionally recognized as being abundant in tomatoes, could emerge as part of complex metabolite networking or individual variability in metabolism after consuming tomato products. The presence of phase II reaction metabolites mentioned in the study also supports the possibility of diterpenoids arising from metabolic processes. 

Thus, these chemical classes being enriched aligns with the biochemical components known to be influenced by or derived from tomatoes and adds coherence to the findings of the study."	1.0	1.0	YES	Tomatoes are one of the most consumed vegetables in the United States, making them an economically and nutritionally important crop.

Authentic standards for naringenin-4-O-glucuronide and naringenin-7-O-glucuronide confirmed their identities in both modes compared to pooled 6 hour urine. Previously reported compounds in urine after tomato consumption, N-caprylhistidinol and N-caprylhistidinol glucuronide were also identified in positive mode with a level 2 confidence, giving more support for future investigation into these compounds as biomarkers. Several compounds from the features of interest reduced lists could be tentatively identified as metabolites that had undergone phase II reactions prior to urinary excretion. Additional studies will need to be done to test the robustness, analytical performance, stability, and reliability of these compounds.

"Title: Divergent metabolism between Trypanosoma congolense and Trypanosoma brucei results in differential sensitivity to metabolic inhibition
Description: Animal African Trypanosomiasis (AAT) is a debilitating livestock disease prevalent across sub-Saharan Africa, a main cause of which is the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma congolense. In comparison to the well-studied T. brucei, there is a major paucity of knowledge regarding the biology of T. congolense. Here, we use a combination of omics technologies and novel genetic tools to characterise core metabolism in T. congolense mammalian-infective bloodstream-form parasites, and test whether metabolic differences compared to T. brucei impact upon sensitivity to metabolic inhibition. Like the bloodstream stage of T. brucei, glycolysis plays a major part in T. congolense energy metabolism. However, the rate of glucose uptake is significantly lower in bloodstream stage T. congolense, with cells remaining viable when cultured in concentrations as low as 2 mM. Instead of pyruvate, the primary glycolytic endpoints are succinate, malate and acetate. Transcriptomics analysis showed higher levels of transcripts associated with the mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, acetate generation, and the glycosomal succinate shunt in T. congolense, compared to T. brucei. Stable-isotope labelling of glucose enabled the comparison of carbon usage between T. brucei and T. congolense, highlighting differences in nucleotide and saturated fatty acid metabolism. To validate the metabolic similarities and differences, both species were treated with metabolic inhibitors, confirming that electron transport chain activity is not essential in T. congolense. However, the parasite exhibits increased sensitivity to inhibition of mitochondrial pyruvate import, compared to T. brucei. Strikingly, T. congolense exhibited significant resistance to inhibitors of fatty acid synthesis, including a 780-fold higher EC50 for the lipase and fatty acid synthase inhibitor Orlistat, compared to T. brucei. These data highlight that bloodstream form T. congolense diverges from T. brucei in key areas of metabolism, with several features that are intermediate between bloodstream- and insect-stage T. brucei. These results have implications for drug development, mechanisms of drug resistance and host-pathogen interactions.

The description mentions differences in nucleotide and fatty acid metabolism between T. congolense and T. brucei. The enriched classes include nucleosides (20), fatty acids (1, 3, 7, 11, 13, 14, 15, 18, 31, 33), glycerophospholipids (8, 10, 17, 19, 23, 26, 30), and other lipid-related classes like isothiocyanates (28) and steroids (22).

Additionally, the study found that T. congolense was more resistant to fatty acid synthesis inhibitors like Orlistat compared to T. brucei, which aligns with the enrichment of fatty acid classes.

The enrichment of tricarboxylic acids (24) and 2-hydroxydicarboxylic acids (21) could be related to the finding that succinate, malate and acetate are major glycolytic endpoints in T. congolense instead of pyruvate.

Overall, the enriched chemical classes capture the key metabolic differences described between the two trypanosome species, particularly in nucleotide, fatty acid, and central carbon metabolism pathways."	YES. The enrichment results make sense given the study's focus on metabolic differences between Trypanosoma congolense and Trypanosoma brucei, specifically in terms of fatty acid metabolism and glycolysis. The significant enrichment of fatty acid-related chemical classes (such as fatty acid, long-chain fatty acid, straight-chain saturated fatty acid, polyunsaturated fatty acid, omega-hydroxy fatty acid, and others) aligns well with the study's findings on T. congolense's resistance to fatty acid synthesis inhibition and its unique glycolytic endpoints like succinate, malate, and acetate. Additionally, the presence of nucleoside and pyrimidine deoxyribonucleoside enrichment reflects the study's observations on differences in nucleotide metabolism. Enrichment of glycerophospholipids, diols, and other lipids also correlates with the differences in metabolic pathways described, including the role of the mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and glycerophospholipid metabolism. Thus, the enriched chemical classes are consistent with the metabolic pathways and differences highlighted in the study.	1.0	1.0	YES	Animal African Trypanosomiasis (AAT) is a debilitating livestock disease prevalent across sub-Saharan Africa, a main cause of which is the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma congolense.

"Title: Mechanisms of hepatic steatosis in chickens: integrated analysis of the host genome, molecular phenomes and gut microbiome
Description: <p>Hepatic steatosis is the initial manifestation of abnormal liver functions and often leads to liver diseases such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in humans and fatty liver syndrome in animals. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of a large chicken population consisting of 705 adult hens by combining host genome resequencing, liver transcriptome, proteome and metabolome analysis, as well as microbial 16S rRNA gene sequencing of each gut segment. The results showed the heritability (h2 = 0.25) and duodenal microbiability (m2 = 0.26) of hepatic steatosis were relatively high, indicating a large effect of host genetics and duodenal microbiota on chicken hepatic steatosis. Individuals with hepatic steatosis had low microbiota diversity and a decreased genetic potential to process triglyceride output from hepatocytes, fatty acid Î²-oxidation activity and resistance to fatty acid peroxidation. Furthermore, we revealed a molecular network linking host genomic variants (GGA6: 5.59-5.69 Mb), hepatic gene/protein expression (PEMT, phosphatidyl-ethanolamine N-methyltransferase), metabolite abundances (folate, S-adenosylmethionine, homocysteine, phosphatidyl-ethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine) and duodenal microbes (genus Lactobacillus) to hepatic steatosis, which could provide new insights into the regulatory mechanism of fatty liver development.</p>

Many of the enriched classes are related to lipid metabolism, which is highly relevant for a study on fatty liver disease. These include glycerophospholipids, fatty acids (long-chain, polyunsaturated, epoxy, 2-hydroxy), glycerolipids (monoacyl-glycerols, triglycerides), phospholipids (phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, lysophosphatidic acids), and related compounds like fatty alcohols.

There are also enrichments related to oxidative stress (icosanoids, ubiquinones, quinones), which can contribute to liver damage in fatty liver disease.

Some enrichments point to perturbations in amino acid/protein metabolism (dipeptides, quaternary ammonium ions), carbohydrate metabolism (aldoses, myo-inositol phosphates), and nucleic acid metabolism (nucleosides, nucleotides), which are all interconnected with lipid metabolism pathways.

The enrichment of vitamins (folate, vitamin D) and cofactors (flavins) is reasonable, as deficiencies can impact liver function.

Overall, the enriched chemical classes capture major pathways implicated in the development and progression of fatty liver disease, making the results plausible for this study."	YES, the enrichment results make sense. In the context of hepatic steatosis, especially considering the title's focus on chicken liver and the development of fatty liver disease, many of these enriched chemical classes are relevant. Glycerophospholipids and phosphatidylcholines, as mentioned in the study, are closely involved in liver metabolism and lipid transport, which are critical in the context of steatosis. Long-chain fatty acids, fatty acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and triglycerides are directly tied to lipid accumulation and metabolism in the liver. The presence of other related classes like glycerophosphocholine and 1-O-acylglycerophosphoethanolamine further supports their involvement in membrane biosynthesis and lipid remodeling, which are critical in hepatic functions and disorders. The mention of folate and S-adenosylmethionine in the study ties back to methylation and one-carbon metabolism, which can be linked with quaternary ammonium ions (suggesting involvement in methylation reactions, possibly through metabolites like S-adenosylmethionine). Overall, the enriched chemical classes align with known metabolic disruptions and perturbations in lipid metabolism associated with hepatic steatosis.	1.0	1.0	YES	<p>Hepatic steatosis is the initial manifestation of abnormal liver functions and often leads to liver diseases such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in humans and fatty liver syndrome in animals.

"Title: The Bardet-Biedl protein Bbs1 controls photoreceptor outer segment protein and lipid composition
Description: <h4><strong>Summary</strong></h4><p>Primary cilia are key sensory organelles whose dysfunction leads to ciliopathy disorders such as Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS). Retinal degeneration is common in ciliopathies, since the outer segments (OSs) of photoreceptors are highly specialized primary cilia. BBS1, encoded by the most commonly mutated BBS-associated gene, is part of the BBSome protein complex. Using a new bbs1 zebrafish mutant, we show that retinal development and photoreceptor differentiation are unaffected by Bbs1-loss, supported by an initially unaffected transcriptome. Quantitative proteomics and lipidomics on isolated OSs show that Bbs1 is required for BBSome-entry into OSs and that Bbs1-loss leads to accumulation of membrane-associated proteins in OSs, with enrichment in proteins involved in lipid homeostasis. Disruption of the tightly regulated OS lipid composition with increased OS cholesterol content are paralleled by early functional visual deficits, which precede progressive OS morphological anomalies. Our findings identify a new role for Bbs1/BBSome in OS lipid homeostasis and suggest a new pathomechanism underlying retinal degeneration in BBS.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Data availability</strong>:</p><p>The <strong>proteomic </strong>data generated in this study have been deposited in <strong>PRIDE </strong>repository under accession code <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD026646' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>PXD026646</strong></a><strong> </strong>for the <strong>OS proteome</strong> and <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD030522' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>PXD030522</strong></a><strong> </strong>for the <strong>whole eye lysate proteome </strong>[<a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride</a>].</p><p>The <strong>RNAseq </strong>data generated in this study have been deposited in the <strong>SRA </strong>repository under the BioProject accession number <strong>PRJNA789116</strong> [<a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/?term=PRJNA789116' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/?term=PRJNA789116</a>].</p>

The study focuses on the role of the Bbs1 protein in regulating the composition of proteins and lipids in the outer segments of photoreceptor cells. The enriched chemical classes include various lipid classes such as glycerophospholipids, phosphatidylcholines, monoacylglycerols, fatty alcohols, and steroids.

These classes are relevant because the outer segments of photoreceptors are highly specialized ciliary structures with a unique lipid composition. The study found that loss of Bbs1 disrupted the tightly regulated lipid composition in the outer segments, including increased cholesterol content (steroids).

The enrichment of lipid classes like glycerophospholipids, phosphatidylcholines, and monoacylglycerols is consistent with the study's findings that Bbs1 plays a role in maintaining the proper lipid homeostasis in photoreceptor outer segments. Therefore, the enriched chemical classes align well with the study's focus on lipid composition changes in photoreceptor outer segments due to Bbs1 deficiency."	YES, the enrichment results make sense. The study involves photoreceptor outer segments which have a highly specialized lipid composition crucial for proper function. Glycerophospholipids, particularly phosphatidylcholine and glycerophosphocholine, are major components of cellular and especially photoreceptor membranes. The enrichment of steroid compounds could relate to cholesterol, which is specifically mentioned in the description as increased in the OSs due to Bbs1-loss. Diterpenoids and fatty alcohols might also play roles in membrane structure and function, or as signaling molecules in retinal cells. The presence of monoglycerides and monoacylglycerols further aligns with disruptions in lipid homeostasis. Therefore, the chemical class enrichment directly ties into the studyâs focus on lipid metabolism in relation to the BBSome and retinal degeneration in ciliopathy.	1.0	1.0	YES	<h4><strong>Summary</strong></h4><p>Primary cilia are key sensory organelles whose dysfunction leads to ciliopathy disorders such as Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS).

The metabolomics study profiled metabolites from brain regions (entorhinal cortex and primary visual cortex) of mice with different APOE genotypes (APOE3/3, APOE3/4, and APOE4/4). APOE4 is a major genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease.

The enriched chemical classes include:

1. Lipids (fatty acids, diterpenoids, icosanoids, steroids, monoglycerides, glycerophospholipids)
2. Nucleic acid components (nucleosides, nucleoside phosphates, pyrimidine deoxyribonucleosides)
3. Carbohydrates (monosaccharides, alditols)
4. Small molecules (diols, quaternary ammonium ions, flavins, quinones, hydroxydicarboxylic acids, alkanethiols)

These cover a broad range of metabolite classes that are relevant to brain metabolism, lipid metabolism, and potential oxidative stress/redox imbalance, which are all implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. The enrichment of these classes is consistent with the study's aim to investigate metabolic changes associated with the APOE4 genotype and Alzheimer's disease risk."	YES, the enrichment results make sense for this study. The study investigates neuronal hyperactivity in APOE4 mice, a model related to Alzheimer's disease. The enriched chemical classes include several related to lipid metabolism, such as fatty acids, glycerophospholipids, and monoacylglycerols, which are relevant because lipid metabolism is known to play a crucial role in neuron membrane structure and integrity. Changes in lipid metabolism can affect neuronal activity and signalling. Enrichment in nucleosides, nucleoside phosphates, and pyrimidine deoxyribonucleosides can also be linked to neuronal hyperactivity due to changed energy demands and nucleotide metabolism in neurons. Additionally, steroids and diols could play roles related to inflammation and neuronal signalling pathways, further supporting the study's context. The diversity of the enriched classes suggests a broad impact on metabolic processes, which aligns with the complex nature of neuronal alterations in the presence of APOE4.	1.0	1.0	YES	Metabolite profiling was performed on metabolites extracted from the entorhinal cortex and primary visual cortex of 14-15 month old APOE3/3, APOE3/4 and APOE4/4 mice.

"Title: Large neutral amino acid levels tune perinatal neuronal excitability and survival
Description: Surprisingly little is known about the critical metabolic changes that neural cells have to undergo during development and how even mild, temporary shifts in this program can influence brain circuitries and behavior. Inspired by the discovery that mutations in SLC7A5, a transporter of metabolically-essential large neutral amino acids (LNAAs), lead to autism, we employed metabolomic profiling to study the metabolic states of the cerebral cortex across different developmental stages. We found that the forebrain undergoes significant metabolic remodeling throughout development, with certain groups of metabolites showing stage-specific changes. But what are the consequences of interfering with this metabolic program? By manipulating Slc7a5 expression in neural cells, we found that the metabolism of LNAAs and lipids are interconnected in the cortex. Deletion of Slc7a5 in neurons perturbs specifically the postnatal metabolic state leading to a shift in lipid metabolism and a stage- and cell- type-specific alteration in neuronal activity patterns, resulting in a long-term circuit dysfunction.

The study focuses on the metabolism of large neutral amino acids (LNAAs) and how perturbations in their transport and metabolism can impact neuronal activity, survival, and brain circuitry development. The enriched chemical classes align with this focus, including:

1. Lipid classes like glycerophospholipids, fatty acids, diacylglycerols, phospholipids (phosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylserines, phosphatidylethanolamines, phosphatidylglycerols, phosphatidylinositols, etc.), sphingomyelins, and lysophospholipids. These are directly relevant as the study found interconnections between LNAA and lipid metabolism in neurons.

2. Amino acid-related classes like dipeptides and quaternary ammonium ions (which can include amino acid derivatives).

3. Carbohydrate classes like monosaccharides, hexoses, and oligosaccharides, which could be linked to energy metabolism and neurodevelopment.

4. Nucleoside and nucleotide classes, potentially reflecting changes in nucleic acid metabolism during neurodevelopment.

5. Other metabolite classes like porphyrins, flavins, carnitines, and inositol phosphates, which play roles in various metabolic pathways.

The enrichment results capture a broad range of metabolic pathways and classes that could be impacted by LNAA perturbations and are relevant to the study's focus on neuronal metabolism, activity, and development."	"YES, the enrichment results make sense in the context of the study. The research focuses on the role of large neutral amino acids (LNAAs) and their connection to neuronal excitability, survival, and lipid metabolism during development. The enrichment of glycerophospholipids, fatty acids, and various lipid-related classes (such as phosphatidyl-L-serine, phosphatidylcholine, and sphingomyelin) is consistent with the findings that manipulating Slc7a5 affects lipid metabolism in neural cells. Lipids are critical components of neuronal membranes and signal transduction, so their role in neuronal activity and circuit function is expected.

Additionally, the appearance of metabolites related to energy metabolism (e.g., tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates) and membrane composition (e.g., phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol) complements the study's emphasis on metabolic remodeling in the cerebral cortex. The presence of enriched nucleoside and monosaccharide classes suggests broader changes in energy metabolism and nucleotide biosynthesis, which are crucial during neural development. This integrated approach to understanding the metabolism in neural cells during critical developmental windows aligns with the findings of lipid metabolism alterations and the long-term neuronal circuit dysfunctions observed when Slc7a5 expression is altered."	1.0	1.0	YES	Surprisingly little is known about the critical metabolic changes that neural cells have to undergo during development and how even mild, temporary shifts in this program can influence brain circuitries and behavior.

"Title: Inferring metabolic mechanisms of interaction within a defined gut microbiota
Description: The diversity and number of species present within microbial communities create the potential for a multitude of interspecies metabolic interactions. Here, we develop, apply, and experimentally test a framework for inferring metabolic mechanisms associated with interspecies interactions. We perform pairwise growth and metabolome profiling of co-cultures of strains from a model mouse microbiota. We then apply our framework to dissect emergent metabolic behaviors that occur in co-culture. Based on one of the inferences from this framework, we identify and interrogate an amino acid cross-feeding interaction and validate that the proposed interaction leads to a growth benefit in vitro. Our results reveal the type and extent of emergent metabolic behavior in microbial communities composed of gut microbes. We focus on growth-modulating interactions, but the framework can be applied to interspecies interactions that modulate any phenotype of interest within microbial communities.

The gut microbiota is known to produce and utilize a wide range of metabolites, including short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), fatty acids, monosaccharides, oligosaccharides, and nucleosides, which are all represented in the enriched classes. SCFAs, such as butyrate and propionate, are important metabolic products of gut bacteria and have various physiological roles in the host. Fatty acids and fatty alcohols can be derived from the breakdown of dietary lipids or synthesized by certain gut microbes.

Monosaccharides and oligosaccharides can originate from the breakdown of dietary fibers and complex carbohydrates by gut bacteria. Nucleosides and nucleoside phosphates are building blocks of nucleic acids and can be involved in various metabolic processes within the gut microbiota.

The enrichment of cations and quaternary ammonium ions could be related to the involvement of these compounds in various metabolic pathways or their potential roles in microbial signaling and interactions.

Overall, the enriched chemical classes align well with the study's focus on understanding metabolic interactions and mechanisms within a gut microbial community, which is known to be a rich metabolic environment with a diverse range of metabolites produced and exchanged between different microbial species."	YES. The enrichment results make sense for a study focused on metabolic interactions within gut microbiota. Short-chain fatty acids and other fatty acids are well-known metabolites produced by gut microbiota through fermentation processes and are significant in many microbial interactions. Nucleosides and nucleoside phosphates may indicate the exchange and metabolism of nucleotide derivatives, which are often involved in microbial growth and survival. Monosaccharides and oligosaccharides align with the carbohydrate metabolism typical in gut environments, where microbes break down complex polysaccharides. The presence of fatty alcohols, alditols, and straight-chain saturated fatty acids suggests various lipid and carbohydrate utilization pathways. Lastly, the detection of cations and quaternary ammonium ions may reflect ionic homeostasis and nitrogen metabolism, both relevant in microbial interactions. These enriched classes collectively represent a wide array of metabolites that are indicative of interspecies interactions and metabolic exchange in microbial communities.	1.0	1.0	YES	The diversity and number of species present within microbial communities create the potential for a multitude of interspecies metabolic interactions.

"Title: Insights into Metabolic Changes Caused by the Trichoderma virens-Maize Root Interaction
Description: The interactions of crops with root-colonizing endophytic microorganisms are highly relevant to agriculture, because endophytes can modify plant resistance to pests and increase crop yields. We investigated the interactions between the host plant <i>Zea mays</i> and the endophytic fungus <i>Trichoderma virens</i> at 5 days postinoculation grown in a hydroponic system. Wild-type <i>T. virens</i> and two knockout mutants, with deletion of the genes <i>tv2og1</i> or <i>vir4</i> involved in specialized metabolism, were analyzed. Root colonization by the fungal mutants was lower than that by the wild type. All fungal genotypes suppressed root biomass. Metabolic fingerprinting of roots, mycelia, and fungal culture supernatants was performed using ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography coupled to diode array detection and quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry. The metabolic composition of <i>T. virens</i>-colonized roots differed profoundly from that of noncolonized roots, with the effects depending on the fungal genotype. In particular, the concentrations of several metabolites derived from the shikimate pathway, including an amino acid and several flavonoids, were modulated. The expression levels of some genes coding for enzymes involved in these pathways were affected if roots were colonized by the â<i>vir4</i> genotype of <i>T. virens</i>. Furthermore, mycelia and fungal culture supernatants of the different <i>T. virens</i> genotypes showed distinct metabolomes. Our study highlights the fact that colonization by endophytic <i>T. virens</i> leads to far-reaching metabolic changes, partly related to two fungal genes. Both metabolites produced by the fungus and plant metabolites modulated by the interaction probably contribute to these metabolic patterns. The metabolic changes in plant tissues may be interlinked with systemic endophyte effects often observed in later plant developmental stages.[Formula: see text] Copyright Â© 2021 The Author(s).

The study mentions that several flavonoids derived from the shikimate pathway had their concentrations modulated in maize roots upon colonization by the endophytic fungus Trichoderma virens. Flavones and flavanones are subclasses of flavonoids, so their enrichment is consistent with the findings. The enrichment of a diterpenoid and a diol class is not directly supported by the description, but other metabolic changes beyond flavonoids may have occurred that could explain their enrichment.	YES, the enrichment results make sense. The study description indicates that the metabolic composition of maize roots colonized by the endophytic fungus Trichoderma virens differed from non-colonized roots, with significant modulation in metabolites derived from the shikimate pathway, including various flavonoids. Therefore, the enrichment of flavones, flavanones, and flavonoids aligns well with the described modulation of flavonoid metabolism due to fungal colonization. Diterpenoids, which play roles in plant defense and signaling, could also be relevant to the interaction between the plant and the endophytic microorganisms. Diols being enriched might be related to changes in metabolic pathways that were not explicitly detailed in the description but could be part of broader metabolic shifts. Overall, the enriched chemical classes reflect the study's findings on the interactionâs impact on plant metabolism.	1.0	1.0	YES	The interactions of crops with root-colonizing endophytic microorganisms are highly relevant to agriculture, because endophytes can modify plant resistance to pests and increase crop yields.

The study focuses on carbohydrate metabolism and identifies interactions between enzymes involved in this pathway and various metabolites. The enriched chemical classes are consistent with this, including monosaccharides, aldoses, D-hexoses (simple sugars), fatty acids and their derivatives (which can influence carbohydrate metabolism), nucleosides and nucleotides (involved in energy metabolism), and other related classes like glycerophospholipids, inositol phosphates, and carnitine derivatives. The specific finding of lactate dehydrogenase inhibition by long-chain acyl-CoAs is also reflected in the enrichment of classes like fatty acyl-CoAs and omega-hydroxy fatty acids.

YES, the enrichment results make sense. The study focuses on protein-metabolite interactions within carbohydrate metabolism, with an emphasis on the regulation of lactate dehydrogenase. The enriched chemical classes list includes fatty acids several times (fatty acid, long-chain acyl-CoA, branched-chain fatty acyl-CoA, omega-hydroxy fatty acid, short-chain fatty acid, straight-chain saturated fatty acid), which aligns with the study's findings on the inhibition of lactate dehydrogenase by long-chain acyl-coenzyme A and the effects of fatty acids. Additionally, monosaccharides and oligosaccharides are key components of carbohydrate metabolism, which is the study's main focus. Dicarboxylic acids and tricarboxylic acids are integral to energy generation processes, linked closely with carbohydrate metabolism. Glycerophospholipids and associated classes (glycerophosphocholine, O-acyl-L-carnitine) are relevant because they provide key structural components of cellular membranes and are involved in cellular signaling and energy metabolism pathways. The presence of nucleoside phosphates and nucleosides in the results may reflect their roles in energy transfer and cellular signaling, both of which can influence metabolic processes.

These protein-metabolite interactions may contribute to the dynamic, tissue-specific metabolic flexibility that enables growth and survival in an ever-changing nutrient environment.</p>	[{'category': 'CHEBI:35366', 'fold_change': 315.18387116304416, 'original_p_value': 1.6114535114381601e-103, 'adjusted_p_value': 4.512069832026848e-102}, {'category': 'CHEBI:35381', 'fold_change': 456.3644592010607, 'original_p_value': 2.6294269879196575e-74, 'adjusted_p_value': 3.6811977830875206e-73}, {'category': 'CHEBI:23824', 'fold_change': 209.5376069981485, 'original_p_value': 3.324185845512323e-71, 'adjusted_p_value': 3.102573455811501e-70}, {'category': 'CHEBI:25608', 'fold_change': 760.8631742158507, 'original_p_value': 6.534029180768812e-59, 'adjusted_p_value': 4.573820426538168e-58}, {'category': 'CHEBI:23849', 'fold_change': 102.26829564109265, 'original_p_value': 1.2502877360811085e-38, 'adjusted_p_value': 7.001611322054207e-38}, {'category': 'CHEBI:33838', 'fold_change': 361.2994836488812, 'original_p_value': 7.05472396458926e-34, 'adjusted_p_value': 3.2922045168083215e-33}, {'category': 'CHEBI:23899', 'fold_change': 77.77010584184227, 'original_p_value': 2.4373709994153596e-19, 'adjusted_p_value': 9.749483997661439e-19}, {'category': 'CHEBI:36916', 'fold_change': 182.02783272393054, 'original_p_value': 2.082480321806157e-14, 'adjusted_p_value': 7.28868112632155e-14}, {'category': 'CHEBI:17522', 'fold_change': 614.9175525631939, 'original_p_value': 2.507870009944308e-13, 'adjusted_p_value': 7.802262253160069e-13}, {'category': 'CHEBI:35267', 'fold_change': 86.49549498229324, 'original_p_value': 3.774986330382219e-12, 'adjusted_p_value': 1.0569961725070215e-11}, {'category': 'CHEBI:50699', 'fold_change': 380.130850675429, 'original_p_value': 4.681369142726673e-10, 'adjusted_p_value': 1.1916212363304258e-09}, {'category': 'CHEBI:27093', 'fold_change': 229.74941524339113, 'original_p_value': 3.566711399574407e-09, 'adjusted_p_value': 8.32232659900695e-09}, {'category': 'CHEBI:68472', 'fold_change': 696.9065595716199, 'original_p_value': 1.223608744427032e-08, 'adjusted_p_value': 2.6354649879966843e-08}, {'category': 'CHEBI:10615', 'fold_change': 412.642041851617, 'original_p_value': 6.048691351560642e-08, 'adjusted_p_value': 1.2097382703121284e-07}, {'category': 'CHEBI:50263', 'fold_change': 373.3427997705107, 'original_p_value': 8.1936967585332e-08, 'adjusted_p_value': 1.5294900615928637e-07}, {'category': 'CHEBI:61912', 'fold_change': 1608.2459067037378, 'original_p_value': 7.104168705584623e-07, 'adjusted_p_value': 1.243229523477309e-06}, {'category': 'CHEBI:30527', 'fold_change': 746.6855995410212, 'original_p_value': 3.439524392511824e-06, 'adjusted_p_value': 5.665098999431239e-06}, {'category': 'CHEBI:37739', 'fold_change': 31.968190806037605, 'original_p_value': 8.996695522071714e-06, 'adjusted_p_value': 1.3994859701000444e-05}, {'category': 'CHEBI:26666', 'fold_change': 251.89393719456135, 'original_p_value': 3.085730721274656e-05, 'adjusted_p_value': 4.547392641878441e-05}, {'category': 'CHEBI:15693', 'fold_change': 197.23770553913766, 'original_p_value': 5.038830627848163e-05, 'adjusted_p_value': 7.054362878987427e-05}, {'category': 'CHEBI:39418', 'fold_change': 163.3374748995984, 'original_p_value': 7.349272705339106e-05, 'adjusted_p_value': 9.799030273785474e-05}, {'category': 'CHEBI:24026', 'fold_change': 56.35363015403933, 'original_p_value': 0.0006111424529838892, 'adjusted_p_value': 0.0007778176674340407}, {'category': 'CHEBI:25448', 'fold_change': 580.7554663096831, 'original_p_value': 0.0017205013405043885, 'adjusted_p_value': 0.002094523371048821}, {'category': 'CHEBI:36313', 'fold_change': 31.822217332037432, 'original_p_value': 0.0018845553654803005, 'adjusted_p_value': 0.002198647926393684}, {'category': 'CHEBI:47908', 'fold_change': 475.1635633442862, 'original_p_value': 0.0021024344131668265, 'adjusted_p_value': 0.0023547265427468454}, {'category': 'CHEBI:4194', 'fold_change': 254.96581447742184, 'original_p_value': 0.003914629954834981, 'adjusted_p_value': 0.004215755335976134}, {'category': 'CHEBI:75659', 'fold_change': 174.22663989290493, 'original_p_value': 0.005723547718455574, 'adjusted_p_value': 0.005935530967287262}, {'category': 'CHEBI:57643', 'fold_change': 28.957336270288913, 'original_p_value': 0.03394798793815577, 'adjusted_p_value': 0.03394798793815577}]	m_MTBLS7237_FIA-MS___metabolite_profiling_v2_maf	MTBLS7237	Protein-metabolite interactomics of carbohydrate metabolism reveal regulation of lactate dehydrogenase
"Title: Large neutral amino acid levels tune perinatal neuronal excitability and survival
Description: Surprisingly little is known about the critical metabolic changes that neural cells have to undergo during development and how even mild, temporary shifts in this program can influence brain circuitries and behavior. Inspired by the discovery that mutations in SLC7A5, a transporter of metabolically-essential large neutral amino acids (LNAAs), lead to autism, we employed metabolomic profiling to study the metabolic states of the cerebral cortex across different developmental stages. We found that the forebrain undergoes significant metabolic remodeling throughout development, with certain groups of metabolites showing stage-specific changes. But what are the consequences of interfering with this metabolic program? By manipulating Slc7a5 expression in neural cells, we found that the metabolism of LNAAs and lipids are interconnected in the cortex. Deletion of Slc7a5 in neurons perturbs specifically the postnatal metabolic state leading to a shift in lipid metabolism and a stage- and cell- type-specific alteration in neuronal activity patterns, resulting in a long-term circuit dysfunction.

The study focuses on the metabolism of large neutral amino acids (LNAAs) and lipids in the developing brain, and how perturbations in this metabolic program can influence neuronal activity and brain circuitry. The enriched chemical classes include:

1. Lipids: phospholipids (phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylglycerol), fatty acids (long-chain fatty acids), glycerolipids (monoacylglycerol, triglycerides), and lipid-related compounds (glycerophosphocholine, glycerophospholipid, glycerophosphoinositol).
2. Amino acid-related compounds: quaternary ammonium ions.
3. Signaling molecules: icosanoids (derived from fatty acids), ubiquinones (involved in electron transport chain).
4. Steroids: cholesterol derivatives with potential signaling roles.
5. Nucleotides: nucleoside phosphates, which are building blocks of DNA/RNA.

The enrichment of these classes aligns with the study's focus on amino acid and lipid metabolism in the developing brain, as well as potential downstream effects on neuronal signaling and function. Therefore, the enriched chemical classes are relevant and make sense in the context of the study."	YES. The enrichment results make sense considering the study's focus on the metabolic role of large neutral amino acids (LNAAs) in neuronal development and function. The study indicates that the deletion of Slc7a5 affects lipid metabolism, so it's reasonable to see various lipid classes enriched, such as 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, glycerophosphocholine, glycerophospholipids, and phosphatidylcholine. These lipids play crucial roles in cell membrane structure and signaling, which aligns with the study's context of metabolic changes affecting neuronal activity and circuit function. The presence of long-chain fatty acids and monoacylglycerol further supports the lipid metabolism focus. Moreover, metabolites like ubiquinones and steroids, involved in cellular respiration and signaling, support the notion of altered neuronal activity patterns due to metabolic shifts. Overall, the enrichment reflects an interconnected lipid and amino acid metabolism system implicated in neuronal development and activity.	1.0	1.0	YES	Surprisingly little is known about the critical metabolic changes that neural cells have to undergo during development and how even mild, temporary shifts in this program can influence brain circuitries and behavior.

"Title: A metabolite roadmap of the wood-forming tissue in Populus tremula (GC-MS assay; Wood ring and extraxylary tissue)
Description: <p>Wood, or secondary xylem, is the product of xylogenesis, a developmental process that begins with the proliferation of cambial derivatives and ends with mature xylem fibers and vessels with lignified secondary cell walls. Fully mature xylem has undergone a series of cellular processes, including cell division, cell expansion, secondary wall formation, lignification and programmed cell death. A complex network of interactions between transcriptional regulators and signal transduction pathways controls wood formation. However, the role of metabolites during this developmental process has not been comprehensively characterized. To evaluate the role of metabolites during wood formation, we performed a high spatial resolution metabolomics study of the wood-forming zone of Populus tremula, including laser dissected aspen ray and fiber cells. We show that metabolites show specific patterns within the wood-forming zone, following the differentiation process from cell division to cell death. The data from profiled laser dissected aspen ray and fiber cells suggests that these two cell types host distinctly different metabolic processes.

The enrichment of fatty acids (including long-chain, straight-chain saturated, polyunsaturated, and omega-hydroxy fatty acids), diterpenoids, glycerophospholipids, and steroids likely reflects the important roles of lipids and isoprenoids in membrane biogenesis, signaling, and wood/cell wall biosynthesis during xylogenesis. Monosaccharides, hexoses, aldoses, and oligosaccharides are key building blocks for cellulose and hemicellulose polymers that form the major components of wood cell walls. The enrichment of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates (tricarboxylic acids) points to active primary metabolism fueling energy and biosynthetic precursor demands during wood formation. Inositol phosphates may be involved in signaling during xylogenesis. Nucleoside phosphates and quaternary ammonium ions could be related to nucleic acid and compatible solute metabolism respectively. The enrichment profile captures major metabolic pathways and processes expected to be active during the developmental program of wood formation in this tree species."	"YES, the enrichment results largely make sense given the context of the study. The metabolic processes involved in wood formation, such as cell wall biosynthesis and lignification, typically involve primary metabolites like fatty acids and monosaccharides. Fatty acids and their derivatives, such as long-chain, straight-chain saturated, and polyunsaturated fatty acids, play roles in membrane structure and signaling pathways. Monosaccharides and related compounds like D-hexose and oligosaccharides are key components of cell wall polysaccharides such as cellulose and hemicellulose, which are crucial during wood formation.

Furthermore, diterpenoids and trienoic fatty acids are likely related to the synthesis of lignin precursors, which are essential for creating lignified secondary cell walls in xylem tissue. The presence of tricarboxylic acids (as part of the TCA cycle) and myo-inositol phosphate suggests active energy metabolism and signaling roles. Quinic acid is also relevant as it is involved in the shikimate pathway, which leads to the biosynthesis of aromatic compounds including lignin precursors.

The enrichment of certain metabolites like nucleoside phosphates, glycerophospholipids, and quaternary ammonium ions could indicate active involvement in signaling and cellular maintenance processes, consistent with active cell development and differentiation in the cambial tissue.

"Title: Subcellular antibiotic visualization reveals a dynamic drug reservoir in infected macrophages
Description: Tuberculosis, caused by the intracellular pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis, remains the world's deadliest infectious disease. Sterilizing chemotherapy requires at least 6 months of multidrug therapy. Difficulty visualizing the subcellular localization of antibiotics in infected host cells means that it is unclear whether antibiotics penetrate all mycobacteria-containing compartments in the cell. Here, we combined correlated light, electron, and ion microscopy to image the distribution of bedaquiline in infected human macrophages at submicrometer resolution. Bedaquiline accumulated primarily in host cell lipid droplets, but heterogeneously in mycobacteria within a variety of intracellular compartments. Furthermore, lipid droplets did not sequester antibiotic but constituted a transferable reservoir that enhanced antibacterial efficacy. Thus, strong lipid binding facilitated drug trafficking by host organelles to an intracellular target during antimicrobial treatment.

The enrichment of glycerophospholipids, glycerophosphocholines, and phosphatidylcholines is reasonable, as these are major lipid components of cellular membranes and lipid droplets, which the study found to be a reservoir for bedaquiline accumulation.

The presence of steroids and diterpenoids is also expected, as these are classes of lipids that can be found in cells and may be involved in lipid droplet composition or metabolism.

The quaternary ammonium ion class likely represents the positively charged chemical structure of bedaquiline itself, which is a diarylquinoline antibiotic.

The enrichment of ubiquinones and quinones is also relevant, as these are redox-active lipid-like molecules involved in electron transport chains and cellular respiration, which could be impacted by the antibiotic treatment.

Overall, the enriched chemical classes reflect the lipid-rich environment of macrophages, the lipophilic nature of bedaquiline, and potential mechanisms of antibiotic accumulation and action within the infected host cells."	YES, the enrichment results make sense given the study context. The study focuses on the distribution of the antibiotic bedaquiline in infected macrophages, specifically its accumulation in lipid droplets. The enrichment of glycerophospholipids, glycerophosphocholine, 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, and phosphatidylcholine aligns with the study's findings involving lipid droplets, which are mainly composed of glycerophospholipids such as phosphatidylcholine. Quaternary ammonium ions may relate to the structure or function of the antibiotic or the membrane components where it is sequestered. Steroids and diterpenoids are often components of cellular lipids or involved in the structural integrity of lipid storage bodies. Ubiquinones and quinones could relate to mitochondrial function or electron transport, potentially indicating involvement in cellular pathways impacted by antibiotic localization. Overall, the chemical classes largely pertain to lipid metabolism and associated cellular compartments, consonant with the studyâs conclusions.	1.0	1.0	YES	Tuberculosis, caused by the intracellular pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis, remains the world's deadliest infectious disease.

"Title: Changes in the Milk Metabolome of the Giant Panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) with Time after Birth â Three Phases in Early Lactation and Progressive Individual Differences
Description: Ursids (bears) in general, and giant pandas in particular, are highly altricial at birth. The components of bear milks and their changes with time may be uniquely adapted to nourish relatively immature neonates, protect them from pathogens, and support the maturation of neonatal digestive physiology. Serial milk samples collected from three giant pandas in early lactation were subjected to untargeted metabolite profiling and multivariate analysis. Changes in milk metabolites with time after birth were analysed by Principal Component Analysis, Hierarchical Cluster Analysis and further supported by Orthogonal Partial Least Square-Discriminant Analysis, revealing three phases of milk maturation: days 1â6 (Phase 1), days 7â20 (Phase 2), and beyond day 20 (Phase 3). While the compositions of Phase 1 milks were essentially indistinguishable among individuals, divergences emerged during the second week of lactation. OPLS regression analysis positioned against the growth rate of one cub tentatively inferred a correlation with changes in the abundance of a trisaccharide, isoglobotriose, previously observed to be a major oligosaccharide in ursid milks. Three artificial milk formulae used to feed giant panda cubs were also analysed, and were found to differ markedly in component content from natural panda milk.

The enriched classes include various types of lipids (fatty acids, icosanoids, diterpenoids, glycerophospholipids, sphingomyelins), carbohydrates (monosaccharides, oligosaccharides), and other biomolecules that are expected to be present in milk. The presence of fatty acids, including long-chain and polyunsaturated fatty acids, is reasonable as they are important for providing energy and essential nutrients for the newborn. Oligosaccharides and other carbohydrates are also crucial components of milk, serving as prebiotics and energy sources. Lipids like glycerophospholipids and sphingomyelins play roles in membrane structure and cellular signaling. The enrichment of these diverse classes of metabolites aligns with the study's aim of characterizing the dynamic changes in the milk metabolome during early lactation, which is critical for supporting the growth and development of the giant panda cubs."	YES, the enrichment results make sense. The study investigates the changes in the milk metabolome of giant pandas in different phases of lactation, which is highly relevant for understanding the nutritional needs and protection of their altricial neonates. Metabolites such as fatty acids, long-chain fatty acids, and polyunsaturated fatty acids are crucial for energy provision and development of the neonates' brains and tissues. Icosanoids, which are involved in immune function, align with the need to protect the neonates from pathogens. The presence of oligosaccharides, such as isoglobotriose, supports the role in immune protection and gut microbiome development. Additionally, metabolites like glycerophospholipids and sphingomyelins are important for building cell membranes and aiding cognitive development. Overall, these enriched classes reflect both the nutritional and protective functions that are critical for the growth and immune support of panda cubs, making the results consistent with the study's objectives.	1.0	1.0	YES	Ursids (bears) in general, and giant pandas in particular, are highly altricial at birth. The components of bear milks and their changes with time may be uniquely adapted to nourish relatively immature neonates, protect them from pathogens, and support the maturation of neonatal digestive physiology. Serial milk samples collected from three giant pandas in early lactation were subjected to untargeted metabolite profiling and multivariate analysis. Changes in milk metabolites with time after birth were analysed by Principal Component Analysis, Hierarchical Cluster Analysis and further supported by Orthogonal Partial Least Square-Discriminant Analysis, revealing three phases of milk maturation: days 1â6 (Phase 1), days 7â20 (Phase 2), and beyond day 20 (Phase 3). While the compositions of Phase 1 milks were essentially indistinguishable among individuals, divergences emerged during the second week of lactation. OPLS regression analysis positioned against the growth rate of one cub tentatively inferred a correlation with changes in the abundance of a trisaccharide, isoglobotriose, previously observed to be a major oligosaccharide in ursid milks. Three artificial milk formulae used to feed giant panda cubs were also analysed, and were found to differ markedly in component content from natural panda milk. These findings have implications for the dependence of the ontogeny of all species of bears, and potentially other members of the Carnivora and beyond, on the complexity and sequential changes in maternal provision of micrometabolites in the immediate period after birth.

The study focused on changes in lipid and metabolite fingerprints in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) patients before and after nephrectomy (surgical removal of the kidney). The enriched classes are primarily related to lipids and fatty acids, which aligns with the study's focus.

Specifically:

1. Glycerophosphocholine and glycerophospholipids are major components of cell membranes and lipid metabolism.
2. Quaternary ammonium ions are present in phospholipids like phosphatidylcholines.
3. Polyunsaturated fatty acids, long-chain fatty acids, and fatty acids in general are important lipid components impacted in cancer metabolism.
4. 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholines are a specific class of phospholipids mentioned in the study.
5. Icosanoids are signaling lipids derived from fatty acids, which could be relevant in cancer pathways.

YES, the enrichment results make sense. The study focuses on the metabolic changes observed after the surgical removal of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), with a particular emphasis on lipid metabolism, specifically phosphatidylcholines and linoleic acid. The enriched chemical classes include glycerophosphocholine and glycerophospholipid, which are classes directly related to phosphatidylcholine metabolism. Phosphatidylcholines (PCs) are a subtype of glycerophospholipids, explaining their prominence in the findings, as the study mentions specific PCs like PC 16:0/0:0 and PC 18:2/18:2. Quaternary ammonium ions can also relate to this class due to the ammonium functional group characteristic of many phospholipids. Additionally, the study mentions linoleic acid, a polyunsaturated fatty acid, which corresponds with the enrichment of polyunsaturated fatty acid and long-chain fatty acid classes. The presence of fatty acid and icosanoid classes further supports the study's focus on fatty acid metabolism and eicosanoids, which are lipid signaling molecules that can influence cancer progression and metabolism. Overall, the enriched chemical classes align well with the study's findings related to lipid and fatty acid changes associated with ccRCC and its surgical treatment.	1.0	1.0	YES	<p>The ultimate goal of surgical treatment in cancer is to remove the tumor mass for restoring a healthy state.

"Title: Metabolomics study of COVID-19 patients in four different clinical stages
Description: <p>SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) is the coronavirus strain causing the respiratory pandemic COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019). To understand the pathobiology of SARS-CoV-2 in humans it is necessary to unravel the metabolic changes that are produced in the individuals once the infection has taken place. The goal of this work is to provide new information about the altered biomolecule profile and with that the altered biological pathways of patients in different clinical situations due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. This is done via metabolomics using HPLC-QTOF-MS analysis of plasma samples at COVID-diagnose from a total of 145 adult patients, divided into different clinical stages based on their subsequent clinical outcome (25 negative controls (non-COVID); 28 positive patients with asymptomatic disease not requiring hospitalization; 27 positive patients with mild disease defined by a total time in hospital lower than 10 days; 36 positive patients with severe disease defined by a total time in hospital over 20 days and/or admission at the ICU; and 29 positive patients with fatal outcome or deceased). Moreover, follow up samples between 2 and 3 months after hospital discharge were also obtained from the hospitalized patients with mild prognosis. The final goal of this work is to provide biomarkers that can help to better understand how the COVID-19 illness evolves and to predict how a patient could progress based on the metabolites profile of plasma obtained at an early stage of the infection. In the present work, several metabolites were found as potential biomarkers to distinguish between the end-stage and the early-stage (or non-COVID) disease groups. These metabolites are mainly involved in the metabolism of carnitines, ketone bodies, fatty acids, lysophosphatidylcholines/phosphatidylcholines, tryptophan, bile acids and purines, but also omeprazole.

In addition, the levels of several of these metabolites decreased to ânormalâ values at hospital discharge, suggesting some of them as early prognosis biomarkers in COVID-19 at diagnose.</p>	[{'category': 'CHEBI:35267', 'fold_change': 572.4220133047446, 'original_p_value': 7.669923802267346e-78, 'adjusted_p_value': 1.3038870463854489e-76}, {'category': 'CHEBI:36313', 'fold_change': 621.92083466072, 'original_p_value': 9.851461103994817e-67, 'adjusted_p_value': 8.373741938395594e-66}, {'category': 'CHEBI:37739', 'fold_change': 289.24707524358155, 'original_p_value': 1.9926029218246915e-53, 'adjusted_p_value': 1.1291416557006586e-52}, {'category': 'CHEBI:36916', 'fold_change': 752.9058197385167, 'original_p_value': 2.414487583465684e-51, 'adjusted_p_value': 1.0261572229729158e-50}, {'category': 'CHEBI:64482', 'fold_change': 1027.5770169394202, 'original_p_value': 2.6789808486755055e-30, 'adjusted_p_value': 9.108534885496719e-30}, {'category': 'CHEBI:75659', 'fold_change': 2270.011046511628, 'original_p_value': 2.861935429702898e-28, 'adjusted_p_value': 8.108817050824877e-28}, {'category': 'CHEBI:23849', 'fold_change': 90.11811895976972, 'original_p_value': 2.676990337522553e-23, 'adjusted_p_value': 6.501262248269056e-23}, {'category': 'CHEBI:57643', 'fold_change': 335.36635959543906, 'original_p_value': 1.998905389093211e-18, 'adjusted_p_value': 4.247673951823073e-18}, {'category': 'CHEBI:23899', 'fold_change': 84.4393445695584, 'original_p_value': 3.5328337803700704e-15, 'adjusted_p_value': 6.673130474032355e-15}, {'category': 'CHEBI:23824', 'fold_change': 42.13086574817424, 'original_p_value': 1.671988078137115e-07, 'adjusted_p_value': 2.842379732833095e-07}, {'category': 'CHEBI:33838', 'fold_change': 69.7392026578073, 'original_p_value': 0.000400296781591148, 'adjusted_p_value': 0.000618640480640865}, {'category': 'CHEBI:28868', 'fold_change': 1080.9576411960134, 'original_p_value': 0.0009247106984088191, 'adjusted_p_value': 0.001310006822745827}, {'category': 'CHEBI:17636', 'fold_change': 840.7448320413437, 'original_p_value': 0.001188757576227561, 'adjusted_p_value': 0.0015236352658806885}, {'category': 'CHEBI:35757', 'fold_change': 796.4951040391677, 'original_p_value': 0.0012547584542546848, 'adjusted_p_value': 0.0015236352658806885}, {'category': 'CHEBI:64583', 'fold_change': 687.8821353065539, 'original_p_value': 0.0014527350741236535, 'adjusted_p_value': 0.0016464330840068075}, {'category': 'CHEBI:24026', 'fold_change': 40.790854384755214, 'original_p_value': 0.024219730742922267, 'adjusted_p_value': 0.02479996798635961}, {'category': 'CHEBI:15904', 'fold_change': 39.82475520195838, 'original_p_value': 0.02479996798635961, 'adjusted_p_value': 0.02479996798635961}]	m_MTBLS3800_LC-MS_positive_reverse-phase_metabolite_profiling_v2_maf	MTBLS3800	Metabolomics study of COVID-19 patients in four different clinical stages
"Title: Untargeted metabolomics profiling reveals exercise intensity-dependent alterations in Thoroughbred racehorsesâ plasma after routine conditioning sessions
Description: <p>Thoroughbred (TB) racehorses are subjected to rigorous conditioning programs involving exercise sessions of various types, distances and intensities. These programs aim to optimize both their physical and mental capabilities, which are essential to achieve maximal performance. Conventional investigations of exercise-induced metabolic responses typically focus on a limited set of targeted hematological and biochemical parameters. This field study was conducted to comprehensively assess the metabolic responses triggered by exercise sessions routinely used in TB conditioning. To accomplish this, we employed an untargeted metabolomics approach. Blood samples were collected from 10 racehorses at rest and after completing a routine exercise session. The population was subsequently divided into two groups based on the intensity of the exercise performed: a high-intensity group (n = 6, gallop at Â± 13.38 m/s, 1400 m) and a moderate-intensity group (n = 4, soft canter at Â± 7.63 m/s, 2500 m). The exercise intensity was evaluated through monitoring of speed, heart rate, and targeted hematological and biochemical parameters (e.g., lactatemia, hematocrit, etc). Resting and 30 min post-exercise plasma samples were analyzed using an untargeted metabolomics approach based on ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry. Unsupervised principal component analysis revealed changes in the metabolome from pre- to post-exercise samples with greater alterations following high-intensity exercise. 54 metabolites, mainly related to amino acid, fatty acid, nucleic acid and vitamin metabolism, were altered following high-intensity exercise versus 23 metabolites, mainly related to fatty acid and amino acid metabolism, following moderate-intensity exercise. Untargeted metabolomics complemented the routine biochemical analyses, allowing a more comprehensive exploration of the exercise-induced response to exercises used in routine conditioning. As previously reported by traditional biochemistry, exercise-induced changes in energy metabolism in TB racehorses have been confirmed. Through metabolomics, the involvement of lipid and amino acid metabolism during routine exercise and recovery has been highlighted, aspects that had previously been largely overlooked in Thoroughbred racehorses.</p>

The description mentions that the metabolomics study found alterations in metabolites related to amino acid, fatty acid, nucleic acid, and vitamin metabolism after high-intensity exercise, and alterations related to fatty acid and amino acid metabolism after moderate-intensity exercise. The list of enriched chemical classes aligns with these findings:

1. Fatty acids, including straight-chain saturated fatty acids, long-chain fatty acids, and polyunsaturated fatty acids, are directly related to the reported alterations in fatty acid metabolism.

2. Monosaccharides, diols, and aldoses (a class of monosaccharides) are sugars and sugar derivatives, which could be related to energy metabolism and potentially linked to the reported alterations in fatty acid metabolism.

3. Nucleosides are components of nucleic acids, which aligns with the reported alterations in nucleic acid metabolism.

4. Steroids and diterpenoids are classes of lipids, which could also be related to the reported alterations in fatty acid metabolism.

5. Tricarboxylic acid could be related to energy metabolism pathways like the citric acid cycle.

6. Icosanoids are a class of lipid signaling molecules derived from fatty acids, which could also be linked to the reported alterations in fatty acid metabolism.

Overall, the enriched chemical classes encompass various aspects of lipid, carbohydrate, nucleic acid, and energy metabolism, which makes sense given the reported metabolic alterations induced by exercise in this study."	YES, the enrichment results make sense given the study's description. The metabolomics study revealed alterations in metabolites related to energy metabolism, particularly highlighting the involvement of lipid (including fatty acids) and amino acid metabolism during exercise and recovery in Thoroughbred racehorses. The top enriched chemical classes, such as fatty acids, straight-chain saturated fatty acids, long-chain fatty acids, and polyunsaturated fatty acids, correspond to the metabolic pathways that are typically involved in exercise-induced physiological changes. The presence of icosanoids, which are derivatives of fatty acids and play a role in inflammation and other biological processes during intense physical activities, also aligns with the study's focus. Additionally, enrichment in classes like tricarboxylic acids and nucleosides is consistent with their roles in energy production and metabolic flux during high-intensity exercise. Overall, the enriched chemical classes align well with what would be expected from the exercise-induced metabolic changes in racehorses, as described in the study.	1.0	1.0	YES	<p>Thoroughbred (TB) racehorses are subjected to rigorous conditioning programs involving exercise sessions of various types, distances and intensities.

"Title: Altered metabolome and microbiome features provide clues in understanding irritable bowel syndrome and depression comorbidity

To address this issue, we performed metabolomic and metagenomic profiling of stool and serum samples based on discovery (<em>n</em>â=â330) and validation (<em>n</em>â=â101) cohorts. Fecal metagenomic data showed moderate dysbiosis compared with other diseases, in contrast, serum metabolites showed significant differences with greater power to distinguish IBS patients from healthy controls. Specifically, 726 differentially abundant serum metabolites were identified, including a cluster of fatty acyl-CoAs enriched in IBS.

"Title: Altered metabolome and microbiome features provide clues in understanding irritable bowel syndrome and depression comorbidity
Description: <p>Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the functional gastrointestinal disorders characterized by chronic and/or recurrent symptoms of abdominal pain and irregular defecation. Changed gut microbiota has been proposed to mediate IBS; however, contradictory results exist, and IBS-specific microbiota, metabolites, and their interactions remain poorly understood. To address this issue, we performed metabolomic and metagenomic profiling of stool and serum samples based on discovery (<em>n</em>â=â330) and validation (<em>n</em>â=â101) cohorts. Fecal metagenomic data showed moderate dysbiosis compared with other diseases, in contrast, serum metabolites showed significant differences with greater power to distinguish IBS patients from healthy controls. Specifically, 726 differentially abundant serum metabolites were identified, including a cluster of fatty acyl-CoAs enriched in IBS. We further identified 522 robust associations between differentially abundant gut bacteria and fecal metabolites, of which three species including&nbsp;<em>Odoribacter splanchnicus</em>,&nbsp;<em>Escherichia coli</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Ruminococcus gnavus</em>&nbsp;were strongly associated with the low abundance of dihydropteroic acid. Moreover, dysregulated tryptophan/serotonin metabolism was found to be correlated with the severity of IBS depression in both fecal and serum metabolomes, characterized by a shift in tryptophan metabolism towards kynurenine production. Collectively, our study revealed serum/fecal metabolome alterations and their relationship with gut microbiome, highlighted the massive alterations of serum metabolites, which empower to recognize IBS patients, suggested potential roles of metabolic dysregulation in IBS pathogenesis, and offered new clues to understand IBS depression comorbidity. Our study provided a valuable resource for future studies, and would facilitate potential clinical applications of IBS featured microbiota and/or metabolites.</p>

The study investigated metabolomic alterations in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients, and the enriched classes are dominated by lipids and fatty acids, which align with the findings of fatty acyl-CoAs being enriched in IBS patients. Additionally, the presence of amino acids, bile acids, and compounds related to tryptophan/serotonin metabolism (e.g., non-proteinogenic amino acids) is consistent with the observed dysregulation of tryptophan/serotonin metabolism and its link to IBS depression comorbidity. The enrichment results cover a broad range of metabolite classes that are relevant to the gastrointestinal and neurological aspects of IBS, supporting the study's findings and providing insights into the metabolic dysregulation associated with this condition.	YES, the enrichment results make sense. The study focuses on irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and its potential linkage to depression, primarily through the metabolome and microbiome of the gut. The enriched chemical classes such as fatty acids (including unsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids), steroids, bile acids, and various forms of phospholipids correlate well with known aspects of IBS pathophysiology and gut microbiota interactions. For example, bile acids and fatty acids play a significant role in gut health and are often dysregulated in gastrointestinal disorders. Icosanoids and steroids are also involved in inflammation and immune responses, which can be relevant to IBS symptoms. Amino acids, particularly those related to tryptophan metabolism, are significant given their role in serotonin pathways, which have been linked to mood and gastrointestinal function. Therefore, there's a coherent connection between the enriched classes and the study's emphasis on the biochemical underpinnings of IBS and its comorbidity with depression.	1.0	1.0	YES	<p>Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the functional gastrointestinal disorders characterized by chronic and/or recurrent symptoms of abdominal pain and irregular defecation.

"Title: Metabolomic signatures discriminate horses with clinical signs of atypical myopathy from healthy co-grazing horses
Description: Atypical myopathy (AM) is a severe rhabdomyolysis syndrome that occurs in grazing horses. Despite the presence of toxins in their blood, all horses from the same pasture are not prone to display clinical signs of AM. The objective of this study was to compare the blood metabolomic profiles of horses with AM clinical signs with those of healthy co-grazing (Co-G) horses. To do so, plasma samples from 5 AM horses and 11 Co-G horses were investigated using untargeted metabolomics. Metabolomic data were evaluated using unsupervised, supervised, and pathway analyses. Unsupervised principal component analysis performed with all detected features separated AM and healthy Co-G horses. Supervised analyses had identified 1276 features showing differential expression between both groups. Among them, 46 metabolites, belonging predominantly to the fatty acid, fatty ester, and amino acid chemical classes, were identified by standard comparison. Fatty acids, unsaturated fatty acids, organic dicarboxylic acids, and fatty esters were detected with higher intensities in AM horses in link with the toxins' pathological mechanism. The main relevant pathways were lipid metabolism; valine, leucine, and isoleucine metabolism; and glycine metabolism. This study revealed characteristic metabolite changes in the plasma of clinically affected horses, which might ultimately help scientists and field veterinarians to detect and manage AM. The raw data of metabolomics are available in the MetaboLights database with the access number MTBLS2579.
Enriched: 1. fatty acid; 2. long-chain fatty acid; 3. icosanoid; 4. straight-chain saturated fatty acid; 5. polyunsaturated fatty acid; 6. omega-hydroxy fatty acid; 7. prenols; 8. fatty alcohol; 9. steroid; 10. diol; 11. diterpenoid"	1.0	0.0	1.0	1.0	2	"YES, the enrichment results for the chemical classes make sense based on the study description.

The description mentions that fatty acids, unsaturated fatty acids, and fatty esters were detected at higher intensities in horses with atypical myopathy (AM) clinical signs compared to healthy co-grazing horses. This aligns with the enriched chemical classes listed, which include fatty acids (classes 1, 4), long-chain fatty acids (class 2), polyunsaturated fatty acids (class 5), and fatty alcohols (class 8).

Additionally, the description states that the relevant pathways included lipid metabolism, which further supports the enrichment of fatty acid-related classes like fatty acids, long-chain fatty acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and fatty alcohols.

The enrichment of other classes like icosanoids (class 3), prenols (class 7), steroids (class 9), diols (class 10), and diterpenoids (class 11) could potentially be related to the dysregulation of lipid metabolism or other pathways affected in AM horses, although the study description does not explicitly mention these classes.

Overall, the enriched chemical classes, particularly those related to fatty acids and lipids, are consistent with the metabolomic changes observed in horses with AM clinical signs compared to healthy co-grazing horses, as described in the study."	YES, the enrichment results make sense. Atypical myopathy (AM) is known to be linked to disruptions in lipid metabolism and the presence of specific toxins that affect muscle tissue, leading to rhabdomyolysis. The chemical classes that are enriched in this study, such as fatty acids, long-chain fatty acids, and other lipid-related compounds, align with the known mechanisms underlying AM. The study discusses issues with lipid metabolism and identifies relevant pathways like valine, leucine, and isoleucine metabolism, which are part of amino acid pathways often impacted in muscle disorders. This suggests a plausible connection between the enriched chemical classes and the pathological mechanisms of AM. Therefore, the results are consistent with the study's aim to understand metabolic discrepancies in horses affected by AM compared to healthy co-grazing horses.	1.0	1.0	YES	Atypical myopathy (AM) is a severe rhabdomyolysis syndrome that occurs in grazing horses.

"Title: Large neutral amino acid levels tune perinatal neuronal excitability and survival
Description: Surprisingly little is known about the critical metabolic changes that neural cells have to undergo during development and how even mild, temporary shifts in this program can influence brain circuitries and behavior. Inspired by the discovery that mutations in SLC7A5, a transporter of metabolically-essential large neutral amino acids (LNAAs), lead to autism, we employed metabolomic profiling to study the metabolic states of the cerebral cortex across different developmental stages. We found that the forebrain undergoes significant metabolic remodeling throughout development, with certain groups of metabolites showing stage-specific changes. But what are the consequences of interfering with this metabolic program? By manipulating Slc7a5 expression in neural cells, we found that the metabolism of LNAAs and lipids are interconnected in the cortex. Deletion of Slc7a5 in neurons perturbs specifically the postnatal metabolic state leading to a shift in lipid metabolism and a stage- and cell- type-specific alteration in neuronal activity patterns, resulting in a long-term circuit dysfunction.

The description mentions that the metabolism of large neutral amino acids (LNAAs) and lipids are interconnected in the cerebral cortex during development. It also states that manipulating the SLC7A5 transporter, which transports LNAAs, perturbs the postnatal metabolic state and leads to alterations in lipid metabolism.

The enriched chemical classes are primarily related to various lipid classes such as glycerophospholipids, phosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylglycerols, phosphatidic acids, phosphatidylethanolamines, phosphatidylinositols, fatty acids, and icosanoids. These classes are consistent with the study's findings of alterations in lipid metabolism upon perturbation of LNAA transport.

Additionally, the enrichment of quaternary ammonium ions and diols could potentially be related to the amino acid metabolism aspect of the study, as these classes can be derived from amino acid metabolic pathways.

Overall, the enriched chemical classes align well with the study's focus on the interconnection between LNAA and lipid metabolism during neural development, supporting the plausibility of the enrichment results."	YES, the enrichment results make sense given the study's focus and findings. The study discusses the interconnected metabolism of large neutral amino acids (LNAAs) and lipids in the cortex, particularly after manipulating the SLC7A5 transporter. The listed enriched classes are predominantly lipids or related to lipid metabolism, such as glycerophospholipids, glycerophosphocholine, diacylglycerol phosphocholine, and various phosphatidyl compounds. These are essential components in neuronal membranes and are known to play crucial roles in neural excitability and function. Considering the study's emphasis on lipid metabolism changes due to alterations in Slc7a5 expression, the enriched lipid classes align well with the observed metabolic remodeling and neuronal activity patterns reported.	1.0	1.0	YES	Surprisingly little is known about the critical metabolic changes that neural cells have to undergo during development and how even mild, temporary shifts in this program can influence brain circuitries and behavior.

"Title: Anti-anemia drug FG4592 retards the AKI to CKD transition by improving vascular regeneration and anti-oxidative capability (day 21)
Description: <p>Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a known risk factor for the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD), with no satisfactory strategy to prevent the progression of AKI to CKD. Damage to the renal vascular system and subsequent hypoxia are common contributors to both AKI and CKD. Hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) is reported to protect the kidney from acute ischemic damage and a novel HIF stabilizer, FG4592 (Roxadustat), has become available in the clinic as an anti-anemia drug. However, the role of FG4592 in the AKI-to-CKD transition remains elusive. In the present study, we investigated the role of FG4592 in the AKI-to-CKD transition induced by unilateral kidney ischemia-reperfusion (UIR). The results showed that FG4592, given to mice 3 days after UIR, markedly alleviated kidney fibrosis and enhanced renal vascular regeneration, possibly via activating the HIF-1Î±/vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA)/VEGF receptor 1 (VEGFR1) signaling pathway and driving the expression of the endogenous antioxidant superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2). In accordance with the improved renal vascular regeneration and redox balance, the metabolic disorders of the UIR mice kidneys were also attenuated by treatment with FG4592. However, the inflammatory response in the UIR kidneys was not affected significantly by FG-4592. Importantly, in the kidneys of CKD patients, we also observed enhanced HIF-1Î± expression which was positively correlated with the renal levels of VEGFA and SOD2.

"Title: Metabolomics study of COVID-19 patients in four different clinical stages
Description: <p>SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) is the coronavirus strain causing the respiratory pandemic COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019). To understand the pathobiology of SARS-CoV-2 in humans it is necessary to unravel the metabolic changes that are produced in the individuals once the infection has taken place. The goal of this work is to provide new information about the altered biomolecule profile and with that the altered biological pathways of patients in different clinical situations due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. This is done via metabolomics using HPLC-QTOF-MS analysis of plasma samples at COVID-diagnose from a total of 145 adult patients, divided into different clinical stages based on their subsequent clinical outcome (25 negative controls (non-COVID); 28 positive patients with asymptomatic disease not requiring hospitalization; 27 positive patients with mild disease defined by a total time in hospital lower than 10 days; 36 positive patients with severe disease defined by a total time in hospital over 20 days and/or admission at the ICU; and 29 positive patients with fatal outcome or deceased). Moreover, follow up samples between 2 and 3 months after hospital discharge were also obtained from the hospitalized patients with mild prognosis. The final goal of this work is to provide biomarkers that can help to better understand how the COVID-19 illness evolves and to predict how a patient could progress based on the metabolites profile of plasma obtained at an early stage of the infection. In the present work, several metabolites were found as potential biomarkers to distinguish between the end-stage and the early-stage (or non-COVID) disease groups.

The study analyzed plasma samples from COVID-19 patients at different clinical stages, as well as follow-up samples after recovery. The enriched chemical classes align with the metabolites and pathways mentioned as being altered in COVID-19 patients:

1. Fatty acids, long-chain fatty acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and fatty acid anions are consistent with altered fatty acid metabolism mentioned.

2. Glycerophospholipids, glycerophosphocholines, phosphatidylcholines, and 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholines are various classes of phospholipids, and their enrichment matches the observation of altered lysophosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylcholine levels.

3. Carnitines could be related to the enriched quaternary ammonium ions.

4. Ketone bodies and bile acids are also mentioned as having altered levels.

5. Tryptophan metabolism changes are reflected by the enrichment of indole derivatives like icosanoids and diterpenoids.

6. Purine metabolism alterations align with the enrichment of quaternary ammonium ions.

So in summary, the enriched chemical classes correspond well to the metabolic pathways and biomolecules reported as being perturbed in this COVID-19 metabolomics study across different disease stages."	YES, the enrichment results make sense. The study focuses on the metabolomic profiling of COVID-19 patients, aiming to identify metabolic changes and potential biomarkers across different stages of the disease. The enrichment of classes such as fatty acids (including long-chain, polyunsaturated, and trienoic fatty acids), glycerophospholipids, and glycerophosphocholine is expected due to their roles in inflammation, energy metabolism, and membrane fluidity, which are crucial in viral infections like COVID-19. Steroids are important for the immune response and recovery process, which aligns with their enrichment. Icosanoids are involved in inflammatory responses, making their prominence relevant. Diterpenoids, although less commonly mentioned in viral infection studies, may have secondary roles or be part of host defense mechanisms. The finding of metabolites related to phosphatidylcholine matches well with the studyâs emphasis on alterations in lysophosphatidylcholines and phosphatidylcholines. The presence of metabolites within these chemical classes provides a coherent metabolic context for examining the systemic impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection and aligns with the pathways altered by the disease.	1.0	1.0	YES	<p>SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) is the coronavirus strain causing the respiratory pandemic COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019). To understand the pathobiology of SARS-CoV-2 in humans it is necessary to unravel the metabolic changes that are produced in the individuals once the infection has taken place. The goal of this work is to provide new information about the altered biomolecule profile and with that the altered biological pathways of patients in different clinical situations due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. This is done via metabolomics using HPLC-QTOF-MS analysis of plasma samples at COVID-diagnose from a total of 145 adult patients, divided into different clinical stages based on their subsequent clinical outcome (25 negative controls (non-COVID); 28 positive patients with asymptomatic disease not requiring hospitalization; 27 positive patients with mild disease defined by a total time in hospital lower than 10 days; 36 positive patients with severe disease defined by a total time in hospital over 20 days and/or admission at the ICU; and 29 positive patients with fatal outcome or deceased). Moreover, follow up samples between 2 and 3 months after hospital discharge were also obtained from the hospitalized patients with mild prognosis. The final goal of this work is to provide biomarkers that can help to better understand how the COVID-19 illness evolves and to predict how a patient could progress based on the metabolites profile of plasma obtained at an early stage of the infection. In the present work, several metabolites were found as potential biomarkers to distinguish between the end-stage and the early-stage (or non-COVID) disease groups. These metabolites are mainly involved in the metabolism of carnitines, ketone bodies, fatty acids, lysophosphatidylcholines/phosphatidylcholines, tryptophan, bile acids and purines, but also omeprazole. In addition, the levels of several of these metabolites decreased to ânormalâ values at hospital discharge, suggesting some of them as early prognosis biomarkers in COVID-19 at diagnose.</p>	[{'category': 'CHEBI:23899', 'fold_change': 236.15556530022835, 'original_p_value': 2.7250008735065223e-37, 'adjusted_p_value': 6.540002096415654e-36}, {'category': 'CHEBI:23849', 'fold_change': 135.02017823240757, 'original_p_value': 1.329737603140015e-27, 'adjusted_p_value': 1.595685123768018e-26}, {'category': 'CHEBI:35366', 'fold_change': 159.5137884544675, 'original_p_value': 3.5526320673532565e-23, 'adjusted_p_value': 2.842105653882605e-22}, {'category': 'CHEBI:15904', 'fold_change': 501.20911424903716, 'original_p_value': 3.5506359404435355e-22, 'adjusted_p_value': 2.1303815642661214e-21}, {'category': 'CHEBI:35341', 'fold_change': 321.1795335828569, 'original_p_value': 2.000145331392271e-20, 'adjusted_p_value': 9.600697590682902e-20}, {'category': 'CHEBI:37739', 'fold_change': 145.61121056164689, 'original_p_value': 2.4849214343150276e-17, 'adjusted_p_value': 9.93968573726011e-17}, {'category': 'CHEBI:36313', 'fold_change': 225.47205207211888, 'original_p_value': 4.377098006621077e-15, 'adjusted_p_value': 1.5007193165557977e-14}, {'category': 'CHEBI:35267', 'fold_change': 175.1006361836668, 'original_p_value': 2.5688609342928444e-14, 'adjusted_p_value': 7.706582802878533e-14}, {'category': 'CHEBI:64482', 'fold_change': 653.1531667168524, 'original_p_value': 1.8845709300367412e-13, 'adjusted_p_value': 5.025522480097977e-13}, {'category': 'CHEBI:57643', 'fold_change': 293.1047451748756, 'original_p_value': 1.0638696854463213e-11, 'adjusted_p_value': 2.5532872450711715e-11}, {'category': 'CHEBI:23824', 'fold_change': 58.914706574682675, 'original_p_value': 3.1406506428158386e-08, 'adjusted_p_value': 6.852328675234556e-08}, {'category': 'CHEBI:26208', 'fold_change': 362.77993031358886, 'original_p_value': 8.985765590745368e-08, 'adjusted_p_value': 1.7971531181490735e-07}, {'category': 'CHEBI:28868', 'fold_change': 3023.166085946574, 'original_p_value': 2.0147199031163584e-07, 'adjusted_p_value': 3.7194828980609694e-07}, {'category': 'CHEBI:35757', 'fold_change': 2227.5960633290547, 'original_p_value': 3.785315665440403e-07, 'adjusted_p_value': 6.489112569326406e-07}, {'category': 'CHEBI:36916', 'fold_change': 157.92658657929863, 'original_p_value': 1.091302859165634e-06, 'adjusted_p_value': 1.7460845746650143e-06}, {'category': 'CHEBI:73155', 'fold_change': 1113.7980316645273, 'original_p_value': 1.555269356050972e-06, 'adjusted_p_value': 2.332904034076458e-06}, {'category': 'CHEBI:35381', 'fold_change': 86.61185239410375, 'original_p_value': 6.562698522418922e-06, 'adjusted_p_value': 9.264986149297302e-06}, {'category': 'CHEBI:10283', 'fold_change': 920.0940261576529, 'original_p_value': 0.0010862852811409827, 'adjusted_p_value': 0.0014483803748546436}, {'category': 'CHEBI:4194', 'fold_change': 516.1503073567321, 'original_p_value': 0.0019356050992256053, 'adjusted_p_value': 0.002444974862179712}, {'category': 'CHEBI:18133', 'fold_change': 306.6980087192177, 'original_p_value': 0.0032553457979870447, 'adjusted_p_value': 0.003906414957584454}, {'category': 'CHEBI:17522', 'fold_change': 248.96661884265905, 'original_p_value': 0.004008706045432539, 'adjusted_p_value': 0.004581378337637187}, {'category': 'CHEBI:15693', 'fold_change': 199.64304341156623, 'original_p_value': 0.00499663433798043, 'adjusted_p_value': 0.005450873823251378}, {'category': 'CHEBI:39418', 'fold_change': 165.32939532520328, 'original_p_value': 0.006030564354021936, 'adjusted_p_value': 0.006292762804196803}, {'category': 'CHEBI:27093', 'fold_change': 116.27561869025286, 'original_p_value': 0.008563876792877055, 'adjusted_p_value': 0.008563876792877055}]	m_MTBLS3800_LC-MS_negative_reverse-phase_metabolite_profiling_v2_maf	MTBLS3800	Metabolomics study of COVID-19 patients in four different clinical stages
"Title: Untargeted metabolomics profiling reveals exercise intensity-dependent alterations in Thoroughbred racehorsesâ plasma after routine conditioning sessions
Description: <p>Thoroughbred (TB) racehorses are subjected to rigorous conditioning programs involving exercise sessions of various types, distances and intensities. These programs aim to optimize both their physical and mental capabilities, which are essential to achieve maximal performance. Conventional investigations of exercise-induced metabolic responses typically focus on a limited set of targeted hematological and biochemical parameters. This field study was conducted to comprehensively assess the metabolic responses triggered by exercise sessions routinely used in TB conditioning. To accomplish this, we employed an untargeted metabolomics approach. Blood samples were collected from 10 racehorses at rest and after completing a routine exercise session. The population was subsequently divided into two groups based on the intensity of the exercise performed: a high-intensity group (n = 6, gallop at Â± 13.38 m/s, 1400 m) and a moderate-intensity group (n = 4, soft canter at Â± 7.63 m/s, 2500 m). The exercise intensity was evaluated through monitoring of speed, heart rate, and targeted hematological and biochemical parameters (e.g., lactatemia, hematocrit, etc). Resting and 30 min post-exercise plasma samples were analyzed using an untargeted metabolomics approach based on ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry. Unsupervised principal component analysis revealed changes in the metabolome from pre- to post-exercise samples with greater alterations following high-intensity exercise. 54 metabolites, mainly related to amino acid, fatty acid, nucleic acid and vitamin metabolism, were altered following high-intensity exercise versus 23 metabolites, mainly related to fatty acid and amino acid metabolism, following moderate-intensity exercise. Untargeted metabolomics complemented the routine biochemical analyses, allowing a more comprehensive exploration of the exercise-induced response to exercises used in routine conditioning. As previously reported by traditional biochemistry, exercise-induced changes in energy metabolism in TB racehorses have been confirmed. Through metabolomics, the involvement of lipid and amino acid metabolism during routine exercise and recovery has been highlighted, aspects that had previously been largely overlooked in Thoroughbred racehorses.</p>

YES, the enrichment results make sense. The study investigates changes in the metabolome of Thoroughbred racehorses as a result of differing exercise intensities, emphasizing alterations in amino acid, fatty acid, nucleic acid, and vitamin metabolism. The enriched chemical classes align well with these findings. Diols and fatty acids reflect perturbations in lipid metabolism, consistent with the involvement of energy and lipid pathways during exercise. Nucleosides and pyrimidine deoxyribonucleosides suggest involvement with nucleic acid metabolism, likely reflecting changes in cellular turnover or repair. Monosaccharides could indicate alterations in carbohydrate metabolism, which is crucial for energy during high-intensity workouts. Omega-hydroxy fatty acids are also relevant as they are involved in complex lipid metabolic pathways. Thus, the enriched chemical classes are consistent with the study's focus on metabolic alterations due to exercise, specifically regarding energy, lipid, and nucleotide metabolism.	1.0	1.0	YES	<p>Thoroughbred (TB) racehorses are subjected to rigorous conditioning programs involving exercise sessions of various types, distances and intensities.

"Title: Phosphorus availability regulates intracellular nucleotides in marine eukaryotic phytoplankton
Description: Phosphorus limitation is pervasive in the oligotrophic surface ocean and marine microorganisms use different strategies to survive, and thrive, at these low nutrient levels. Eukaryotic algae such as diatoms are extremely sensitive to phosphorus limitation and recent transcriptomics work has suggested that multiple cellular processes are affected under these growth conditions. Metabolomics is the systematic study of intra- and extracellular metabolites, i.e. the end products of microbial metabolism. As such, metabolomics complements genomics and transcriptomics through the identification and quantification of metabolic intermediates that reflect cellular physiology. Here, we applied intracellular metabolomics to examine the differential response of the model diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana to phosphate-replete and phosphate-limited growth conditions. We focused on metabolites from the purine and pyrimidine biochemical pathways, due to their role in phosphorus cycling associated with nucleic acid synthesis. Under phosphate-replete conditions, T. pseudonana stored nucleotides with phosphate moieties such as adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) and, to a lesser extent, inosine 5'-monophosphate (IMP). In contrast, under phosphate-limited conditions, T. pseudonana had higher concentrations of adenine, inosine, and adenosine all of which lack phosphate moieties. Furthermore, based on previously published transcriptomics data, T. pseudonana differentially regulates select genes that can alter these nucleic acid precursors through the gain or loss of the phosphate moiety. Thus, our analysis of the metabolomics and transcriptomics data converged upon the sensitivity of the purine biochemical pathway to phosphorus availability.

"Title: The use of metabolomics to monitor simultaneous changes in metabolic variables following supramaximal low volume high intensity exercise
Description: High intensity exercise (HIE) stimulates greater physiological remodeling when compared to workload matched low-moderate intensity exercise. This study utilized an untargeted metabolomics approach to examine the metabolic perturbations that occur following two workload matched supramaximal low volume HIE trials. In a randomized order, 7 untrained males completed two exercise protocols separated by 1 week; (1) HIE150%: 30 x 20 s cycling at 150% VO2peak, 40 s passive rest; (2) HIE300%: 30 x 10 s cycling at 300% VO2peak, 50 s passive rest. Total exercise duration was 30 min for both trials. Blood samples were taken at rest, during and immediately following exercise and at 60 min post exercise. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of plasma identified 43 known metabolites of which 3 demonstrated significant fold changes (HIE300% compared to the HIE150% value) during exercise, 14 post exercise and 23 at the end of the recovery period. Significant changes in plasma metabolites relating to lipid metabolism [fatty acids: dodecanoate (p=0.042), hexadecanoate (p=0.001), octadecanoate (p=0.001)], total cholesterol (p=0.001), and glycolysis [lactate (p=0.018)] were observed following exercise and during the recovery period. The HIE300% protocol elicited greater metabolic changes relating to lipid metabolism and glycolysis when compared to HIE150% protocol. These changes were more pronounced throughout the recovery period rather than during the exercise bout itself. Data from the current study demonstrate the use of metabolomics to monitor intensity-dependent changes in multiple metabolic pathways following exercise. The small sample size indicates a need for further studies in a larger sample cohort to validate these findings.

The enriched classes include fatty acids (straight-chain saturated fatty acids, long-chain fatty acids, fatty acid methyl esters), monosaccharides (which would include lactate from glycolysis), and other lipid-related classes like glycerophospholipids and steroids. The enrichment results align well with the metabolic pathways highlighted in the study description related to lipid metabolism and glycolysis during and after high-intensity exercise.	YES, the enrichment results make sense. High intensity exercise, especially at supramaximal levels, is known to significantly impact lipid metabolism, glycolysis, and related pathways. The enriched chemical classes identified in the study correspond well with these metabolic perturbations. The presence of fatty acid-related classes (e.g., fatty acid, straight-chain saturated fatty acid, long-chain fatty acid, fatty acid methyl ester) is consistent with the observed changes in lipid metabolism, which is expected as intense exercise increases fatty acid mobilization and metabolism. Monosaccharides and alditols are related to carbohydrate metabolism, including glycolysis, which aligns with observed changes in lactate levels. The enrichment of tricarboxylic acid cycle-related metabolites (e.g., tricarboxylic acid) is also expected, as this pathway is central to energy production during exercise. Additionally, the appearance of glycerophospholipids and steroids may relate to membrane remodeling and hormone signaling changes, respectively, which are pertinent in high-intensity exercise scenarios.

In a randomized order, 7 untrained males completed two exercise protocols separated by 1 week; (1) HIE150%: 30 x 20 s cycling at 150% VO2peak, 40 s passive rest; (2) HIE300%: 30 x 10 s cycling at 300% VO2peak, 50 s passive rest. Total exercise duration was 30 min for both trials. Blood samples were taken at rest, during and immediately following exercise and at 60 min post exercise. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of plasma identified 43 known metabolites of which 3 demonstrated significant fold changes (HIE300% compared to the HIE150% value) during exercise, 14 post exercise and 23 at the end of the recovery period. Significant changes in plasma metabolites relating to lipid metabolism [fatty acids: dodecanoate (p=0.042), hexadecanoate (p=0.001), octadecanoate (p=0.001)], total cholesterol (p=0.001), and glycolysis [lactate (p=0.018)] were observed following exercise and during the recovery period. The HIE300% protocol elicited greater metabolic changes relating to lipid metabolism and glycolysis when compared to HIE150% protocol. These changes were more pronounced throughout the recovery period rather than during the exercise bout itself. Data from the current study demonstrate the use of metabolomics to monitor intensity-dependent changes in multiple metabolic pathways following exercise. The small sample size indicates a need for further studies in a larger sample cohort to validate these findings.

"Title: Multi-omics phenotyping of the gut-liver axis reveals metabolic perturbations from a low-dose pesticide mixture in rats
Description: Health effects of pesticides are not always accurately detected using the current battery of regulatory toxicity tests. We compared standard histopathology and serum biochemistry measures and multi-omics analyses in a subchronic toxicity test of a mixture of six pesticides frequently detected in foodstuffs (azoxystrobin, boscalid, chlorpyrifos, glyphosate, imidacloprid and thiabendazole) in Sprague-Dawley rats. Analysis of water and feed consumption, body weight, histopathology and serum biochemistry showed little effect. Contrastingly, serum and caecum metabolomics revealed that nicotinamide and tryptophan metabolism were affected, which suggested activation of an oxidative stress response. This was not reflected by gut microbial community composition changes evaluated by shotgun metagenomics. Transcriptomics of the liver showed that 257 genes had their expression changed. Gene functions affected included the regulation of response to steroid hormones and the activation of stress response pathways. Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of the same liver samples showed that 4,255 CpG sites were differentially methylated. Overall, we demonstrated that in-depth molecular profiling in laboratory animals exposed to low concentrations of pesticides allows the detection of metabolic perturbations that would remain undetected by standard regulatory biochemical measures and which could thus improve the predictability of health risks from exposure to chemical pollutants.

The enrichment results cover a wide range of lipids (fatty acids, glycerophospholipids, diacylglycerols, sphingomyelins), carbohydrates (monosaccharides, oligosaccharides), nucleic acids and their components (nucleosides, deoxynucleosides), as well as other metabolites like porphyrins, flavonoids, and organic acids. This broad metabolic perturbation aligns with the description of the study detecting oxidative stress responses, hormonal regulation changes, and general metabolic disturbances induced by the low-dose pesticide mixture exposure in the rats. The enriched chemical classes suggest systemic effects across multiple metabolic pathways, consistent with the multi-omics profiling results described.	OTHER. While the study focuses on the metabolic perturbations in response to pesticide exposure affecting the gut-liver axis, the enriched chemical classes mainly consist of lipid-related metabolites such as fatty acids, glycerophospholipids, and steroids, which align with expected oxidative stress and liver metabolism responses. However, the presence of flavonoids (flavanones, flavonoid, flavin, flavones) and porphyrins in the enrichment list could be more related to diet or other influences if not directly studied in conjunction with pesticide exposure. Additionally, since tryptophan metabolism was specifically mentioned in the study's findings, the lack of direct mention of tryptophan or kynurenine pathway metabolites in the list is noteworthy. Therefore, while many of the enriched classes do make sense in the context of the described perturbations, not all are conclusively explained by the study summary alone.	1.0	0.5	YES	Health effects of pesticides are not always accurately detected using the current battery of regulatory toxicity tests.

The enriched classes include various lipids (fatty acids, glycerophospholipids, sphingomyelins, lysophosphatidic acids), carbohydrates (monosaccharides, alditols), nucleosides, and related compounds. These could be indicative of disturbances in energy metabolism, membrane integrity, oxidative stress, and other cellular processes impacted by the pesticide mixture.

The presence of enriched steroid compounds aligns with the transcriptomics data showing changes in steroid hormone regulation pathways in the liver. The enrichment of tryptophan and nicotinamide metabolites also matches the metabolomics findings mentioned in the description.

Overall, the diverse set of enriched chemical classes reflects the multi-omics, multi-tissue analysis performed in this study to comprehensively characterize the metabolic impacts of low-dose pesticide exposure in rats."	OTHER: While some of the enriched chemical classes make sense in the context of the study, there are aspects that are not immediately aligned with the findings described. The study focuses on the effects of pesticide exposure on nicotinamide and tryptophan metabolism, yet these specific pathways are not directly reflected in the enriched chemical classes. Instead, the list is dominated by lipids, including various classes of fatty acids, glycerophospholipids, and glycerophosphocholines, which makes sense given the study's reference to stressed liver metabolism, as these can be key players in liver function and oxidative stress responses. Additionally, the presence of steroids could relate to the observed effects on the regulation of response to steroid hormones. However, there is an absence of classes specifically associated with nicotinamide or tryptophan metabolism, which were highlighted as significantly affected. The presence of cation and quaternary ammonium ion is less directly explainable from the study's results presented. Thus, while many enriched classes seem relevant, the disconnect with the study's highlighted findings suggests a partial mismatch or requires a more detailed clarification to fully align with the study objectives.	1.0	0.5	YES	Health effects of pesticides are not always accurately detected using the current battery of regulatory toxicity tests. We compared standard histopathology and serum biochemistry measures and multi-omics analyses in a subchronic toxicity test of a mixture of six pesticides frequently detected in foodstuffs (azoxystrobin, boscalid, chlorpyrifos, glyphosate, imidacloprid and thiabendazole) in Sprague-Dawley rats. Analysis of water and feed consumption, body weight, histopathology and serum biochemistry showed little effect. Contrastingly, serum and caecum metabolomics revealed that nicotinamide and tryptophan metabolism were affected, which suggested activation of an oxidative stress response. This was not reflected by gut microbial community composition changes evaluated by shotgun metagenomics. Transcriptomics of the liver showed that 257 genes had their expression changed. Gene functions affected included the regulation of response to steroid hormones and the activation of stress response pathways. Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of the same liver samples showed that 4,255 CpG sites were differentially methylated. Overall, we demonstrated that in-depth molecular profiling in laboratory animals exposed to low concentrations of pesticides allows the detection of metabolic perturbations that would remain undetected by standard regulatory biochemical measures and which could thus improve the predictability of health risks from exposure to chemical pollutants.

"Title: Multiomic analysis revealed the potential role of rumen microbes in heat stress
Description: <p>Heat stress is an important issue in dairy cattle feeding management affecting summer health and economic efficiency. In recent years, global climate change has led to an increase in atmospheric CO2 content and average daily temperature, making heat stress a major challenge in dairy farming. This experiment combined 16S rDNA sequencing, metagenomic sequencing and metabolomic analysis. In this experiment, 10 cows each of growing heifers, heifers and lactating cows were selected for sample collection in April and August. Ruminal fluid was collected and filtered through gauze, which was immediately transferred to liquid nitrogen prior to macrogenomic, 16S rDNA sequencing and metabolomic analyses.</p>

The enrichment results cover a wide range of metabolite classes that are relevant to the rumen microbiome and heat stress response in dairy cattle.

Several classes like fatty acids (long-chain, polyunsaturated, straight-chain saturated, epoxy, omega-hydroxy), lipids (diterpenoids, steroids, fatty alcohols, monoglycerides, lipid hydroperoxides), and carnitine derivatives (O-acyl-L-carnitines) are indicative of lipid metabolism and oxidative stress, which are expected to be perturbed under heat stress conditions.

Additionally, classes such as flavonoids (flavones, flavanones), quinones, ubiquinones, and vitamins (vitamin D) are known antioxidants and could be linked to the stress response mechanisms in the rumen microbes.

The enrichment of nucleosides, nucleoside phosphates, pyrimidine deoxyribonucleosides, and oligosaccharides suggests changes in nucleic acid and carbohydrate metabolism, which are fundamental processes in microbial growth and adaptation.

The presence of classes like dipeptides, cardiac glycosides, quinic acid, monocarboxylic acid anions, and tricarboxylic acid could be indicative of changes in protein, secondary metabolite, and energy metabolism pathways in the rumen microbes under heat stress.

Overall, the diverse range of enriched metabolite classes aligns well with the multiomic study design investigating the role of rumen microbes in heat stress response in dairy cattle."	OTHER, the enrichment results include many classes related to lipids, steroids, and fatty acids, which could be relevant due to their roles in energy metabolism and cellular stress responses that could be affected by heat stress in dairy cattle. The presence of diterpenoids, nucleosides, flavonoids, and other organic compounds may also correlate with metabolic responses to stress or adaptations mediated by rumen microbes. However, key classes more directly linked to microbial activity or heat stress-specific metabolites aren't prominently featured or clearly related to the study description, making the results contextually ambiguous without additional information on the metabolic pathways or microbial roles implicated in the study. It's challenging to directly connect all these classes to the study's emphasis on rumen microbes and heat stress without more detailed data or discussion on their specific roles.	1.0	0.5	YES	<p>Heat stress is an important issue in dairy cattle feeding management affecting summer health and economic efficiency.

"Title: Multiomic analysis revealed the potential role of rumen microbes in heat stress
Description: <p>Heat stress is an important issue in dairy cattle feeding management affecting summer health and economic efficiency.

This experiment combined 16S rDNA sequencing, metagenomic sequencing and metabolomic analysis. In this experiment, 10 cows each of growing heifers, heifers and lactating cows were selected for sample collection in April and August.

The enriched classes include various lipids (fatty acids, steroids, glycerophospholipids, phospholipids), which are essential components of cell membranes and can be impacted by heat stress. Nucleosides, nucleotides, and their derivatives are also present, reflecting potential changes in nucleic acid metabolism or degradation.

The presence of flavonoids, quinones, and other plant-derived compounds suggests potential shifts in the metabolism of plant-based feed components by rumen microbes under heat stress. Organic acids like tricarboxylic acids and short-chain fatty acids are byproducts of microbial fermentation in the rumen.

Additionally, some of the enriched classes, such as icosanoids, diols, and epoxy fatty acids, could be related to oxidative stress responses or signaling pathways induced by heat stress conditions.

Overall, the diverse range of enriched chemical classes aligns with the multiomic analysis of rumen microbes and their metabolic processes under heat stress in dairy cattle."	OTHER, the enrichment results appear to partially make sense. Heat stress can alter the metabolic processes and microbial environment in the rumen of dairy cattle. The presence of enriched fatty acid-related classes can be indicative of changes in lipid metabolism, which could be a response to heat stress conditions. The enrichment of icosanoid and diterpenoid classes may also relate to inflammatory responses and adaptive mechanisms under stress. Steroids and their roles in stress response may explain their enrichment too. However, enrichment in classes such as flavonoids, nucleosides, and monosaccharides would require further exploration to fully justify their connection to heat stress in rumen microbes. The presence of many diverse classes may reflect broader stress-related changes but not all may be directly related to heat stress responses, hence it is complex to ascertain the fit entirely.	1.0	0.5	YES	<p>Heat stress is an important issue in dairy cattle feeding management affecting summer health and economic efficiency.

The enrichment of these chemical classes aligns with the phytochemical composition and bioactive constituents present in this medicinal plant species.	OTHER, the enrichment results partially make sense but also partly unexpected. The study focuses on Withania somnifera, which is known to contain withanolides, a group of steroidal lactones. Therefore, the enrichment of steroids seems reasonable given the study's emphasis on withanolides. However, diterpenoids are more commonly associated with plant resins rather than Withania somnifera. Icosanoids and diols are unusual because plant metabolomics studies on Withania somnifera don't typically highlight these compounds. Therefore, while steroids being enriched is expected given the context, the presence of diterpenoids, icosanoids, and diols is less straightforward, suggesting that further investigation into these specific results might be warranted.	1.0	0.5	YES	<p>Characterization of botanical extracts by mass spectrometry-based metabolomics analysis helps in determining the phytochemical composition that underlies their bioactivity and potential health benefits, while also supporting reproducibility of effects in clinical trials.

"Title: Improvement of prediction ability by integrating multi-omic datasets in barley
Description: <p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> Genomic prediction (GP) based on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) has become a broadly used tool to increase the gain of selection in plant breeding. However, using predictors that are biologically closer to the phenotypes such as transcriptome and metabolome may increase the prediction ability in GP. The objectives of this study were to (i) assess the prediction ability for three phenotypic traits using different omic datasets including sequence variants (SV), deleterious SV (dSV), tolerant SV (tSV), expression presence/absence variation (ePAV), gene expression (GE), transcript expression (TE), and metabolites (M) as single predictors in comparison to those using a SNP array; (ii) investigate the improvement in prediction ability when combining multiple omic datasets information to predict phenotypic variation in barley breeding programs; (iii) explore the relationship between genes and metabolites to unravel the metabolic pathway of the three above mentioned phenotypic traits.</p><p><strong>RESULTS:</strong> The prediction ability from genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP) for the three traits using dSV information was higher than when using tSV, all SV information, or the SNP array. Any predictors from the transcriptome (GE, TE, as well as ePAV) and metabolome provided higher prediction abilities compared to the SNP array and SV on average across the three traits. In addition, some (di)-similarity existed between different omic datasets, and therefore provided complementary biological perspectives to phenotypic variation.

Many of the enriched classes like fatty acids, steroids, diterpenoids, glycerolipids, and oligosaccharides are major metabolite classes found in plants. Their enrichment suggests these metabolic pathways may be important for the phenotypic traits studied. The presence of classes like nucleosides also makes sense, as they could be linked to gene expression changes contributing to the phenotypes. Overall, the diverse array of enriched metabolite classes aligns with the integration of metabolomics data with transcriptomics and genomics data in this multi-omics study on predicting agronomic traits in barley."	OTHER. The study focuses on improving phenotypic trait prediction in barley through integrating multiple omic datasets, including metabolomic data, to uncover relationships between genes and metabolites. The enrichment results list a variety of chemical classes, many of which are involved in primary metabolic processes and structural components of the plant, such as fatty acids, monosaccharides, and nucleosides. These classes make sense for a study on genetic prediction improvement in barley, as they reflect fundamental metabolic and structural pathways potentially linked to phenotypic traits. However, without specific information on the traits studied â and given the broad array of enriched classes â it's challenging to make a conclusive judgment on the relevance of each class. The diversity of enriched classes could suggest a wide-ranging exploration of metabolic pathways rather than focused trait-based pathways.	1.0	0.5	YES	<p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> Genomic prediction (GP) based on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) has become a broadly used tool to increase the gain of selection in plant breeding. However, using predictors that are biologically closer to the phenotypes such as transcriptome and metabolome may increase the prediction ability in GP. The objectives of this study were to (i) assess the prediction ability for three phenotypic traits using different omic datasets including sequence variants (SV), deleterious SV (dSV), tolerant SV (tSV), expression presence/absence variation (ePAV), gene expression (GE), transcript expression (TE), and metabolites (M) as single predictors in comparison to those using a SNP array; (ii) investigate the improvement in prediction ability when combining multiple omic datasets information to predict phenotypic variation in barley breeding programs; (iii) explore the relationship between genes and metabolites to unravel the metabolic pathway of the three above mentioned phenotypic traits.</p><p><strong>RESULTS:</strong> The prediction ability from genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP) for the three traits using dSV information was higher than when using tSV, all SV information, or the SNP array. Any predictors from the transcriptome (GE, TE, as well as ePAV) and metabolome provided higher prediction abilities compared to the SNP array and SV on average across the three traits. In addition, some (di)-similarity existed between different omic datasets, and therefore provided complementary biological perspectives to phenotypic variation. Optimal combining the information of dSV, TE, ePAV, as well as metabolites into GP models could improve the prediction ability over that of the single predictors alone.</p><p><strong>CONCLUSIONS:</strong> The use of integrated omic datasets in GP model is highly recommended. Furthermore, we evaluated a cost-effective approach generating 3âend mRNA sequencing with transcriptome data extracted from seedling without losing prediction ability in comparison to the full-length mRNA sequencing, paving the path for the use of such prediction methods in commercial breeding programs.</p>	[{'category': 'CHEBI:35366', 'fold_change': 344.2139645596403, 'original_p_value': 3.7205077961421254e-36, 'adjusted_p_value': 6.696914033055826e-35}, {'category': 'CHEBI:39418', 'fold_change': 2408.153166118421, 'original_p_value': 1.791773429082144e-28, 'adjusted_p_value': 1.6125960861739296e-27}, {'category': 'CHEBI:35381', 'fold_change': 373.79852085876354, 'original_p_value': 7.056732446164996e-19, 'adjusted_p_value': 4.234039467698998e-18}, {'category': 'CHEBI:15904', 'fold_change': 450.6485457063711, 'original_p_value': 1.1830377756879508e-12, 'adjusted_p_value': 5.3236699905957784e-12}, {'category': 'CHEBI:35341', 'fold_change': 288.77984379160375, 'original_p_value': 1.0999769939287071e-11, 'adjusted_p_value': 3.959917178143346e-11}, {'category': 'CHEBI:23849', 'fold_change': 87.40779959255859, 'original_p_value': 1.1173013365705239e-10, 'adjusted_p_value': 3.351904009711571e-10}, {'category': 'CHEBI:24026', 'fold_change': 369.26457653567877, 'original_p_value': 5.167514523301082e-10, 'adjusted_p_value': 1.3287894488488495e-09}, {'category': 'CHEBI:23899', 'fold_change': 106.1664273827781, 'original_p_value': 1.6175714599680581e-09, 'adjusted_p_value': 3.6395357849281306e-09}, {'category': 'CHEBI:17522', 'fold_change': 1208.798452012384, 'original_p_value': 2.358237917220933e-09, 'adjusted_p_value': 4.716475834441866e-09}, {'category': 'CHEBI:23824', 'fold_change': 95.34880143007854, 'original_p_value': 2.758624309239455e-09, 'adjusted_p_value': 4.965523756631019e-09}, {'category': 'CHEBI:10615', 'fold_change': 901.2970914127422, 'original_p_value': 2.3943106745923133e-06, 'adjusted_p_value': 3.917962922060149e-06}, {'category': 'CHEBI:25448', 'fold_change': 1902.7383040935672, 'original_p_value': 0.0005254296506828183, 'adjusted_p_value': 0.0007881444760242275}, {'category': 'CHEBI:37739', 'fold_change': 52.36894414936423, 'original_p_value': 0.0007015565855687348, 'adjusted_p_value': 0.0009713860415567097}, {'category': 'CHEBI:26493', 'fold_change': 796.4951040391676, 'original_p_value': 0.0012547411100257567, 'adjusted_p_value': 0.0016132385700331157}, {'category': 'CHEBI:50263', 'fold_change': 407.7296365914787, 'original_p_value': 0.002449675171816107, 'adjusted_p_value': 0.0029396102061793284}, {'category': 'CHEBI:50699', 'fold_change': 311.3571770334928, 'original_p_value': 0.003206707097951333, 'adjusted_p_value': 0.0036075454851952496}, {'category': 'CHEBI:27093', 'fold_change': 188.18290919606707, 'original_p_value': 0.005300145603567735, 'adjusted_p_value': 0.005611918874365837}, {'category': 'CHEBI:33838', 'fold_change': 78.91541353383458, 'original_p_value': 0.012593070099039332, 'adjusted_p_value': 0.012593070099039332}]	m_MTBLS1561_GC-MS___metabolite_profiling_v2_maf	MTBLS1561	Improvement of prediction ability by integrating multi-omic datasets in barley
"Title: Large neutral amino acid levels tune perinatal neuronal excitability and survival
Description: Surprisingly little is known about the critical metabolic changes that neural cells have to undergo during development and how even mild, temporary shifts in this program can influence brain circuitries and behavior. Inspired by the discovery that mutations in SLC7A5, a transporter of metabolically-essential large neutral amino acids (LNAAs), lead to autism, we employed metabolomic profiling to study the metabolic states of the cerebral cortex across different developmental stages. We found that the forebrain undergoes significant metabolic remodeling throughout development, with certain groups of metabolites showing stage-specific changes. But what are the consequences of interfering with this metabolic program? By manipulating Slc7a5 expression in neural cells, we found that the metabolism of LNAAs and lipids are interconnected in the cortex. Deletion of Slc7a5 in neurons perturbs specifically the postnatal metabolic state leading to a shift in lipid metabolism and a stage- and cell- type-specific alteration in neuronal activity patterns, resulting in a long-term circuit dysfunction.

The description mentions that manipulating the expression of Slc7a5, a transporter of large neutral amino acids (LNAAs), leads to alterations in lipid metabolism and neuronal activity patterns. This is consistent with the enrichment of chemical classes like fatty acids, glycerophospholipids, and icosanoids (a class of lipids derived from fatty acids).

Additionally, the study mentions that the deletion of Slc7a5 in neurons perturbs the postnatal metabolic state, which could explain the enrichment of various metabolite classes like nucleosides, nucleoside phosphates, pyrimidine deoxyribonucleosides (related to nucleic acid metabolism), monosaccharides, aldoses (sugars), and tricarboxylic acids (related to energy metabolism).

The enrichment of steroids could also be relevant, as they are involved in regulating various developmental processes, including neuronal development and function.

Overall, the enriched chemical classes align with the study's focus on metabolic changes, particularly related to lipid and energy metabolism, as well as the potential impact on neuronal activity and brain development."	OTHER, while the study primarily focuses on the role of large neutral amino acids (LNAAs) in neuronal excitability and survival, it finds that metabolism of LNAAs and lipids in the cortex are interconnected. Although fatty acids and some lipid-related classes (like glycerophospholipids) appear in the list, there are several other enriched classes that are not clearly related to LNAAs or lipid metabolism, such as nucleosides, diols, and monosaccharides. This suggests that these enriched classes might be indirectly influenced by the metabolic state changes in the cortex, which affect broader metabolic pathways beyond those specified in the description. Therefore, while some enrichment results make sense in the context of lipid metabolism disturbance, the relevance of other chemical classes to the study's specific focus on neuronal excitability and survival via LNAAs is not directly evident.	1.0	0.5	YES	Surprisingly little is known about the critical metabolic changes that neural cells have to undergo during development and how even mild, temporary shifts in this program can influence brain circuitries and behavior.

"Title: A metabolomics approach to unravel the regulating role of phytohormones towards carotenoid metabolism in tomato fruit. (Zeaxanthin metabolism)
Description: Carotenoids are important secondary metabolites, which have been recognized as an essential component of the human diet because of their valuable beneficial health effects. With this rationale, there is a continuous aim to define the distribution of these compounds in plants, to better understand their metabolism and to increase their concentration levels in fruits and vegetables. This study aimed at deepening the knowledge on the regulatory role of phytohormones in carotenoid metabolism. More specifically, it was envisaged to reveal the phytohormones involved in the metabolism of alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, lycopene, lutein and zeaxanthin. To this purpose, the phytohormone profiles of 50 tomato fruits were determined by high-resolution Orbitrap mass spectrometry and evaluated towards the associated carotenoid levels. Data mining was performed by differential expression and orthogonal partial least squares analyses. This metabolomics approach revealed 5 phytohormonal metabolites, which significantly influenced (Variable Importance in Projection scores =0.80) carotenoid metabolism. These metabolites were identified as cis-12-oxo-phytodienoic acid, cucurbic acid, 2-oxindole-3-acetic acid, 1-acetylindole-3-carboxaldehyde, and cis-zeatin-O-glucoside. The involvement of the individual phytohormones towards carotenoid metabolism was investigated by regression analysis (P values =0.05, R2 varying between 0.280 and 0.760) and statistical correlation (P values =0.01, correlation varying between 0.403 and 0.846). It was concluded that these phytohormones all have significant contributing value in the regulation of carotenoid metabolism, thereby exhibiting down- and up-regulating influences. As a result, this knowledge encloses the potential for improving tomato fruit nutritional quality by targeted control of agronomic conditions, exogenous use of plant bioregulators, or genetic engineering.

Explanation:
1. Long-chain fatty acids are precursors for the biosynthesis of various phytohormones, including oxylipins like jasmonates. The study identified cis-12-oxo-phytodienoic acid, which is a jasmonic acid precursor, as one of the phytohormones influencing carotenoid metabolism. Therefore, enrichment of long-chain fatty acids is relevant.

2. Icosanoids are a class of signaling lipids derived from polyunsaturated fatty acids, including oxylipins like jasmonates. The identified cis-12-oxo-phytodienoic acid falls under this class, making icosanoid enrichment appropriate.

3. Diterpenoids are a class of natural products derived from the condensation of four isoprene units. The study identified cucurbic acid, which is a diterpenoid phytohormone, as one of the regulators of carotenoid metabolism. Hence, the enrichment of diterpenoids is consistent with the findings.

Overall, the enriched chemical classes align with the phytohormones identified as influential towards carotenoid metabolism in tomato fruit, specifically related to oxylipins/jasmonates (long-chain fatty acids, icosanoids) and diterpenoids."	OTHER: The enrichment results of long-chain fatty acid, icosanoid, and diterpenoid might not be directly intuitive for a study focusing on phytohormones and carotenoid metabolism in tomatoes. Carotenoids are terpenoids derived from the isoprenoid pathway, so a connection to diterpenoids makes some sense, given that both are part of the same broader metabolic pathway involving terpenes. However, neither long-chain fatty acids nor icosanoids are directly related to carotenoids or phytohormones. Long-chain fatty acids are usually key to energy storage and structural components of cell membranes, and icosanoids are signaling molecules derived from fatty acids primarily involved in animal systems, not plant growth regulation. It's possible that these enrichments reflect a broader signaling or metabolic context in the tomato fruit beyond the immediate focus of the study. Additional investigation would be necessary to clarify these relationships and any indirect regulatory roles they might play.	1.0	0.5	YES	Carotenoids are important secondary metabolites, which have been recognized as an essential component of the human diet because of their valuable beneficial health effects.

"Title: Altered metabolome and microbiome features provide clues in understanding irritable bowel syndrome and depression comorbidity
Description: <p>Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the functional gastrointestinal disorders characterized by chronic and/or recurrent symptoms of abdominal pain and irregular defecation. Changed gut microbiota has been proposed to mediate IBS; however, contradictory results exist, and IBS-specific microbiota, metabolites, and their interactions remain poorly understood. To address this issue, we performed metabolomic and metagenomic profiling of stool and serum samples based on discovery (<em>n</em>â=â330) and validation (<em>n</em>â=â101) cohorts. Fecal metagenomic data showed moderate dysbiosis compared with other diseases, in contrast, serum metabolites showed significant differences with greater power to distinguish IBS patients from healthy controls. Specifically, 726 differentially abundant serum metabolites were identified, including a cluster of fatty acyl-CoAs enriched in IBS. We further identified 522 robust associations between differentially abundant gut bacteria and fecal metabolites, of which three species including&nbsp;<em>Odoribacter splanchnicus</em>,&nbsp;<em>Escherichia coli</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Ruminococcus gnavus</em>&nbsp;were strongly associated with the low abundance of dihydropteroic acid. Moreover, dysregulated tryptophan/serotonin metabolism was found to be correlated with the severity of IBS depression in both fecal and serum metabolomes, characterized by a shift in tryptophan metabolism towards kynurenine production. Collectively, our study revealed serum/fecal metabolome alterations and their relationship with gut microbiome, highlighted the massive alterations of serum metabolites, which empower to recognize IBS patients, suggested potential roles of metabolic dysregulation in IBS pathogenesis, and offered new clues to understand IBS depression comorbidity. Our study provided a valuable resource for future studies, and would facilitate potential clinical applications of IBS featured microbiota and/or metabolites.</p>

The study investigated metabolomic alterations in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients compared to healthy controls, analyzing both fecal and serum samples. The enriched classes are consistent with the findings reported:

1. Several lipid classes are enriched, including fatty acids (saturated, unsaturated, long-chain, hydroxy, etc.), glycerophospholipids, bile acids, and steroids. This aligns with the observation of a cluster of fatty acyl-CoAs being enriched in IBS patients' serum.

2. Amino acid classes like alpha-amino acids, non-proteinogenic amino acids are enriched, matching the reported dysregulation of tryptophan/serotonin metabolism linked to IBS depression comorbidity.

3. Other enriched classes like carbohydrates (monosaccharides, hexoses), nucleosides, and organic acids (dicarboxylic acids, 2-oxo monocarboxylic acids) further reflect the broad metabolomic alterations observed in IBS.

The enrichment results capture various metabolite classes impacted in IBS, providing insights into potential disrupted metabolic pathways and their links to gut microbiome dysbiosis and depression comorbidity. The enriched classes are comprehensive and align well with the study's major findings."	"OTHER. The enrichment results generally make sense for a study on irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and depression comorbidity. Fatty acids, steroids, amino acids, and phospholipids are expected to be involved due to their roles in gut microbiota interactions, inflammation, and modulation of gut-brain axis signaling. The presence of multiple classes of fatty acids, such as unsaturated, monounsaturated, and short-chain fatty acids, aligns with their known involvement in gut health and inflammation, which are essential in IBS. 

Steroids and bile acids may also play roles in digestion and microbiome-related changes, while tryptophan and its derivatives, such as serotonin, are linked to both IBS and depression. The observation of amino acids is relevant to metabolic dysregulation seen in IBS. Moreover, metabolites like glycerophospholipids and sphingomyelins may reflect alterations in membrane lipid compositions, which are essential for cellular signaling and interactions within the microbial community.

The diversity of enriched classes suggests a complex metabolic landscape associated with IBS and its comorbidity with depression, which the study aims to clarify. However, the presence of some classes like azole and hexose may require further clarification in the context of IBS specifically. Overall, while some unexpected classes appear, the list broadly supports metabolic alterations pertinent to the study's focus."	1.0	0.5	YES	<p>Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the functional gastrointestinal disorders characterized by chronic and/or recurrent symptoms of abdominal pain and irregular defecation.

and depression comorbidity
"Title: Altered metabolome and microbiome features provide clues in understanding irritable bowel syndrome and depression comorbidity
Description: <p>Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the functional gastrointestinal disorders characterized by chronic and/or recurrent symptoms of abdominal pain and irregular defecation. Changed gut microbiota has been proposed to mediate IBS; however, contradictory results exist, and IBS-specific microbiota, metabolites, and their interactions remain poorly understood. To address this issue, we performed metabolomic and metagenomic profiling of stool and serum samples based on discovery (<em>n</em>â=â330) and validation (<em>n</em>â=â101) cohorts. Fecal metagenomic data showed moderate dysbiosis compared with other diseases, in contrast, serum metabolites showed significant differences with greater power to distinguish IBS patients from healthy controls. Specifically, 726 differentially abundant serum metabolites were identified, including a cluster of fatty acyl-CoAs enriched in IBS. We further identified 522 robust associations between differentially abundant gut bacteria and fecal metabolites, of which three species including&nbsp;<em>Odoribacter splanchnicus</em>,&nbsp;<em>Escherichia coli</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Ruminococcus gnavus</em>&nbsp;were strongly associated with the low abundance of dihydropteroic acid. Moreover, dysregulated tryptophan/serotonin metabolism was found to be correlated with the severity of IBS depression in both fecal and serum metabolomes, characterized by a shift in tryptophan metabolism towards kynurenine production. Collectively, our study revealed serum/fecal metabolome alterations and their relationship with gut microbiome, highlighted the massive alterations of serum metabolites, which empower to recognize IBS patients, suggested potential roles of metabolic dysregulation in IBS pathogenesis, and offered new clues to understand IBS depression comorbidity. Our study provided a valuable resource for future studies, and would facilitate potential clinical applications of IBS featured microbiota and/or metabolites.</p>

The enriched classes include various lipids (glycerophospholipids, phosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylinositols, phosphatidylglycerols, fatty acids, steroids, etc.), amino acids, and other metabolites that could be affected in IBS due to gut dysbiosis, inflammation, and altered gut barrier function.

Lipids like phospholipids, fatty acids, and steroids play crucial roles in maintaining gut barrier integrity, regulating inflammation, and modulating gut motility, all of which are disrupted in IBS. Amino acids and their metabolites, such as tryptophan and its metabolites like serotonin and kynurenine, are also highlighted in the study and are known to be involved in gut-brain signaling and depression, which is highly comorbid with IBS.

The enrichment of these classes aligns with the study's findings of altered gut microbiome and metabolome in IBS patients, and their potential roles in IBS pathogenesis and comorbid depression."	OTHER, while some elements of the enrichment results align with the study's focus, such as the emphasis on glycerophospholipids and various fatty acids, which are often relevant in gastrointestinal and metabolic conditions, the diversity and broad range of enriched classes raise questions. The extensive list spans many lipid-related categories, indicating a focus on lipid metabolism which is expected, yet it also includes less directly related classes like diterpenoids and certain non-proteinogenic amino acids, which might not be immediately expected from the study's focus on IBS and depression comorbidity. The presence of compounds like steroid saponins and dodecanoate esters seems unusual without a clearer link to the conditions examined. While lipid and amino acid disruptions are plausible in IBS and depression, the presence of certain categories might suggest either a broader metabolic exploration or require further explanation in the context of IBS and depression comorbidity.	1.0	0.5	YES	<p>Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the functional gastrointestinal disorders characterized by chronic and/or recurrent symptoms of abdominal pain and irregular defecation.

"Title: An Integrated Biochemical, Proteomics, and Metabolomics Approach for Supporting Medicinal Value of Panax ginseng Fruits (GC-MS assay)
Description: Panax ginseng roots are well known for their medicinal properties and have been used in Korean and Chinese traditional medicines for 1000s of years. However, the medicinal value of P. ginseng fruits remain poorly characterized. Using gas chromatography-time of flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF MS), 66 metabolites including amino acids, sugars, organic acids, phenolic acids, phytosterols, tocopherols, and policosanols were identified and quantified. Some of these are well known medicinal compounds and were not previously identified in ginseng. Interestingly, the concentration of almost all metabolites was higher in the Chunpoong and Gumpoong cultivars. Parallel comparison of the four cultivars also revealed higher amounts of the medicinal metabolites in Chunpoong and Gumpoong cultivars. Taken together, our results demonstrate that ginseng fruits are a rich source of medicinal compounds with potential beneficial health effects.

1. Ginseng fruits were found to contain amino acids, sugars, organic acids, phenolic acids, phytosterols, tocopherols, and policosanols using GC-MS analysis.

2. Some of these metabolites are known medicinal compounds not previously identified in ginseng fruits.

3. The medicinal metabolites were present in higher amounts in the Chunpoong and Gumpoong cultivars compared to others.

Diterpenoids are a major class of bioactive compounds in ginseng. Fatty alcohols and tocols (tocopherols) are types of lipids that can act as antioxidants. Steroids like phytosterols are another important class of bioactive plant metabolites. So the enrichment of these chemical classes aligns well with the metabolomics findings highlighting the medicinal potential of ginseng fruits, especially the Chunpoong and Gumpoong cultivars."	OTHER, the enrichment results may be partially expected but also seem somewhat unusual. Panax ginseng is known for containing various saponins and ginsenosides, which are triterpenoids, not diterpenoids. The presence of diterpenoid enrichment is unexpected considering the well-known phytochemical constituents of ginseng. However, ginseng also contains a range of secondary metabolites, so some diterpenoids along with fatty alcohols and tocols (tocopherols) could conceivably contribute to the medicinal value. Steroids, such as phytosterols, are indeed a part of ginseng's profile. The enrichment of fatty alcohols and tocols aligns with the identification of phytosterols and tocopherols in the study, supporting their medicinal value. Overall, while some results align with known properties, the high prominence of diterpenoids is unexpected and may warrant further investigation.	1.0	0.5	YES	Panax ginseng roots are well known for their medicinal properties and have been used in Korean and Chinese traditional medicines for 1000s of years.

"Title: Anti-anemia drug FG4592 retards the AKI to CKD transition by improving vascular regeneration and anti-oxidative capability (day 21)
Description: <p>Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a known risk factor for the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD), with no satisfactory strategy to prevent the progression of AKI to CKD. Damage to the renal vascular system and subsequent hypoxia are common contributors to both AKI and CKD. Hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) is reported to protect the kidney from acute ischemic damage and a novel HIF stabilizer, FG4592 (Roxadustat), has become available in the clinic as an anti-anemia drug. However, the role of FG4592 in the AKI-to-CKD transition remains elusive. In the present study, we investigated the role of FG4592 in the AKI-to-CKD transition induced by unilateral kidney ischemia-reperfusion (UIR). The results showed that FG4592, given to mice 3 days after UIR, markedly alleviated kidney fibrosis and enhanced renal vascular regeneration, possibly via activating the HIF-1Î±/vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA)/VEGF receptor 1 (VEGFR1) signaling pathway and driving the expression of the endogenous antioxidant superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2). In accordance with the improved renal vascular regeneration and redox balance, the metabolic disorders of the UIR mice kidneys were also attenuated by treatment with FG4592. However, the inflammatory response in the UIR kidneys was not affected significantly by FG-4592. Importantly, in the kidneys of CKD patients, we also observed enhanced HIF-1Î± expression which was positively correlated with the renal levels of VEGFA and SOD2. Together, these findings demonstrated the therapeutic effect of the anti-anemia drug FG-4592 in preventing the AKI-to-CKD transition related to ischemia and the redox imbalance.</p><p><br></p><p>Linked study:</p><p><strong>UPLC-MS assay</strong> of mice kidney tissue sacrificed at<strong> day 10 </strong>after UIR is reported in <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS3056' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>MTBLS3056</a></p>

The enrichment of fatty acids, including polyunsaturated fatty acids, long-chain fatty acids, epoxy fatty acids, and omega-hydroxy fatty acids, is consistent with the study's focus on vascular regeneration and oxidative stress. Fatty acids play crucial roles in cellular signaling, inflammation, and oxidative stress processes, which are implicated in the pathogenesis of acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD).

The enrichment of icosanoids, which are derived from polyunsaturated fatty acids, also aligns with the study's emphasis on vascular regeneration and inflammation. Icosanoids are potent mediators of inflammation and vascular homeostasis.

Additionally, the enrichment of antioxidants like flavins and the endogenous antioxidant superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) supports the study's findings regarding the anti-oxidative capability of the drug FG4592.

The enrichment of nucleosides and monosaccharides may reflect alterations in energy metabolism and oxidative stress, which are common features of kidney injury and disease.

Overall, the enriched chemical classes are biologically relevant and consistent with the study's focus on vascular regeneration, oxidative stress, and the transition from AKI to CKD."	OTHER, the enrichment results show a significant presence of lipid-related compounds (e.g., icosanoid, fatty acid, long-chain fatty acid, polyunsaturated fatty acid, epoxy fatty acid) which is consistent with kidney injury studies, as lipids are involved in inflammatory and oxidative stress responses. The enrichment of icosanoids might relate to the inflammatory processes, albeit with FG-4592 not notably affecting inflammation according to the study. The presence of diols, diterpenoids, and steroids can also be tied to cellular signaling and oxidative stress responses in the context of renal ischemia-reperfusion injury. Monosaccharides and oligosaccharides could be related to the energy metabolism in the kidney tissue and their enrichment may reflect changes as a consequence of the injury or treatment. Additionally, tricarboxylic acid enrichment might indicate alterations in cellular metabolism associated with the ischemic injury. The inclusion of glycerophospholipids, part of cell membrane integrity and signaling pathways, and nucleosides, relating to energy transfer and signaling in cells, also aligns with metabolic responses to stress and damage. However, the enrichment results do not clearly focus on direct pathways of oxidative stress and hypoxic response which FG4592 influences according to the study. Therefore, the results are somewhat consistent but do not directly encapsulate the main metabolic processes described in the effects of FG4592.	1.0	0.5	YES	<p>Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a known risk factor for the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD), with no satisfactory strategy to prevent the progression of AKI to CKD.

Description: <p>Bivalves serve as an ideal ecological indicator; hence, their use by the NOAA Mussel Watch Program to monitor environmental health. This study aimed to expand the baseline knowledge of using metabolic end points in environmental monitoring by investigating the dreissenid mussel metabolome in the field.

The mussel metabolome was measured using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and mussel tissue chemical contaminants were analyzed using gas or liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry.

Data also highlighted the importance of considering seasonality or handling effects on the metabolome at the time of sampling. The furthest upstream site presented a specific mussel tissue chemical signature of pesticides (atrazine and metolachlor), while a downstream site, located at Toledo's wastewater treatment plant, was characterized by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and other organic contaminants.

The study investigated the metabolome of mussels exposed to different environmental conditions along the Maumee River. The enrichment of these chemical classes is consistent with changes in energy metabolism and amino acids observed in the mussels, as reported in the study.

Oligosaccharides and monosaccharides are carbohydrates involved in energy storage and metabolism. Nucleoside phosphates are components of nucleic acids like RNA and DNA, which play crucial roles in cellular processes. Fatty acids are the building blocks of lipids, which are essential for energy storage and membrane structure.

These enriched chemical classes likely reflect metabolic alterations in the mussels as they respond to environmental stressors, such as contaminants from pesticides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and other organic compounds present at the various sampling sites along the river."	OTHER, the enrichment results presented (oligosaccharide, nucleoside phosphate, monosaccharide, and fatty acid) do not directly align with the specific environmental contaminant chemistry focus discussed in the study description. The study primarily highlights chemical contaminants such as pesticides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and organic contaminants affecting the metabolome. These contaminants are more likely to affect pathways related to stress response, detoxification, and energy metabolism. Therefore, while it's possible for these enriched classes to be indirectly related due to broader metabolic disruptions, they are not the most expected classes based on the study's context and findings. The metabolic changes one might expect to see in response to the contaminants mentioned could involve amino acids, energy metabolites, and potentially lipids, but the connection with oligosaccharides, nucleoside phosphates, and monosaccharides isn't immediately clear without additional information.	1.0	0.5	YES	<p>Bivalves serve as an ideal ecological indicator; hence, their use by the NOAA Mussel Watch Program to monitor environmental health.

The study investigated interactions between gut bacteria and therapeutic drugs, including potential bioaccumulation and metabolic effects of the drugs on the bacteria. The enriched classes cover a broad range of metabolites and compounds that could be relevant to bacterial metabolism and drug interactions, such as:

- Lipids and fatty acids (fatty acids, fatty alcohols, triglycerides, glycerolipids, etc.)
- Carbohydrates (monosaccharides, oligosaccharides, inositols)
- Nucleosides and nucleotides
- Amino acid derivatives (dipeptides)
- Steroids and terpenoids
- Antibiotics (beta-lactams, cephalosporins, macrolides)
- Quinones and other redox compounds

The inclusion of drug classes like beta-lactams, macrolides, and cephalosporins is especially relevant given the therapeutic drug focus of the study. Overall, this diverse set of enriched metabolite classes aligns well with examining potential accumulation and metabolic effects of drugs by gut microbes."	OTHER. The study focuses on the interaction of gut bacteria with therapeutic drugs, particularly the bioaccumulation of these drugs by bacteria. The enrichment results seem to emphasize various metabolic changes in bacteria, with chemical classes like diols, peptides, terpenoids, fatty acids, and sugars being affected. Drug interaction with bacterial metabolism can indeed affect these metabolic classes by influencing metabolite secretion. However, the association with certain compounds like beta-lactam antibiotics or cephalosporins, which are not directly related unless those compounds are drugs tested in the study, raises questions. Additionally, complex lipids and nucleotides might be less directly relevant unless the interaction impacts broader bacterial metabolic pathways. Overall, the results make moderate sense given the broad metabolic changes resulting from drug-bacteria interactions, but some classes like penicillin and macrolides might not be directly related unless the study tested these specific drugs for interactions.	1.0	0.5	YES	<p>Bacteria in the gut can modulate the availability and efficacy of therapeutic drugs.

"Title: Changes in the Milk Metabolome of the Giant Panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) with Time after Birth â Three Phases in Early Lactation and Progressive Individual Differences
Description: Ursids (bears) in general, and giant pandas in particular, are highly altricial at birth. The components of bear milks and their changes with time may be uniquely adapted to nourish relatively immature neonates, protect them from pathogens, and support the maturation of neonatal digestive physiology. Serial milk samples collected from three giant pandas in early lactation were subjected to untargeted metabolite profiling and multivariate analysis. Changes in milk metabolites with time after birth were analysed by Principal Component Analysis, Hierarchical Cluster Analysis and further supported by Orthogonal Partial Least Square-Discriminant Analysis, revealing three phases of milk maturation: days 1â6 (Phase 1), days 7â20 (Phase 2), and beyond day 20 (Phase 3). While the compositions of Phase 1 milks were essentially indistinguishable among individuals, divergences emerged during the second week of lactation. OPLS regression analysis positioned against the growth rate of one cub tentatively inferred a correlation with changes in the abundance of a trisaccharide, isoglobotriose, previously observed to be a major oligosaccharide in ursid milks. Three artificial milk formulae used to feed giant panda cubs were also analysed, and were found to differ markedly in component content from natural panda milk. These findings have implications for the dependence of the ontogeny of all species of bears, and potentially other members of the Carnivora and beyond, on the complexity and sequential changes in maternal provision of micrometabolites in the immediate period after birth.

The study focused on analyzing changes in the metabolite composition of giant panda milk during early lactation. The enriched chemical classes include:

1. Oligosaccharides: These are mentioned in the description as a major component of ursid (bear) milks, with isoglobotriose being tentatively correlated with cub growth rate.

2. Lipids: Classes like glycerophospholipids, phosphatidylcholines, fatty acids, and steroids are common components of milk and are important for neonatal development.

3. Carbohydrates: Monosaccharides, alditols (sugar alcohols), and diterpenoids (derived from plant terpenoids) are also expected in milk.

4. Other milk components: Cations, quaternary ammonium ions (e.g., choline), and tricarboxylic acids (components of the citric acid cycle) are also reasonable to find enriched in milk samples.

The enrichment results align well with the study's focus on characterizing the changing metabolite profile of panda milk during early lactation, which plays a crucial role in nourishing and supporting the development of the highly altricial panda cubs."	"OTHER, the enrichment results partially make sense. The presence of oligosaccharides being enriched, such as isoglobotriose, is consistent with the study's emphasis on milk composition and its role in supporting neonatal development. This aligns with the natural function of milk oligosaccharides in early nutrition and immune protection. Glycerophospholipids and their specific forms, like phosphatidylcholine, are also relevant to milk, as they are crucial components of cellular membranes and play a role in lipid transport and metabolism, which are essential in the development of newborns. 

However, the high ranking of diols, icosanoids, and diterpenoids is less expected. While these compounds may have roles in various biological processes, their specific significance in milk metabolomics, especially for a species-specific study like this one, is not immediately clear. Enrichment for these classes might suggest some unique functions or metabolic pathways in panda milk, but it isn't straightforwardly explained by the study description. It's also notable that while long-chain fatty acids and steroids appear relevant to milk nutrition and developmental physiology, they are ranked lower in this list. Lastly, the appearance of classes like cations and quaternary ammonium ions, while potentially indicative of certain metabolic processes, does not have a clear direct correlation to mammalian lactation as discussed in the study."	1.0	0.5	YES	Ursids (bears) in general, and giant pandas in particular, are highly altricial at birth.

Three artificial milk formulae used to feed giant panda cubs were also analysed, and were found to differ markedly in component content from natural panda milk.

The enrichment results highlight several classes of biomolecules that are known to play important roles in milk and neonatal development:

1. Quaternary ammonium ions, cations, and sphingomyelins are components of cell membranes and can contribute to the structural and functional development of neonatal tissues.

2. Diterpenoids and icosanoids are lipid-derived signaling molecules that can regulate various physiological processes in the neonate.

3. Diols, oligosaccharides, phosphatidylcholines, and glycerophospholipids are common constituents of milk that provide nutrients, energy sources, and bioactive compounds for the developing neonate.

The enrichment of these classes aligns with the study's focus on characterizing the changing metabolite composition of giant panda milk during early lactation and its potential implications for neonatal growth and development. The progressive changes in milk composition likely reflect the evolving nutritional and developmental needs of the rapidly growing panda cubs."	"OTHER, the enrichment results partly make sense and partly raise questions. The presence of oligosaccharides among the enriched chemical classes aligns well with the study's findings related to isoglobotriose, an important oligosaccharide for ursid milks. Similarly, the prominence of glycerophosphocholine, sphingomyelin, and phosphatidylcholine makes sense considering their role in cellular structure and signaling, and their importance in milk composition as a source of choline for neonatal development. 

However, the significant enrichment of quaternary ammonium ion and general cations seems less intuitive in the context of a study on milk composition during early lactation stages, unless they relate to essential nutrients or biomolecular activity relevant to neonatal development, which isn't explicitly mentioned in the description. Diterpenoids and icosanoids might play a role in neonatal immune protection or development, but their specific relevance would need further clarification within the context of panda milk. Overall, while some of the enriched classes make sense, others require additional context to fully understand their relevance to the study's findings."	1.0	0.5	YES	Ursids (bears) in general, and giant pandas in particular, are highly altricial at birth. The components of bear milks and their changes with time may be uniquely adapted to nourish relatively immature neonates, protect them from pathogens, and support the maturation of neonatal digestive physiology. Serial milk samples collected from three giant pandas in early lactation were subjected to untargeted metabolite profiling and multivariate analysis. Changes in milk metabolites with time after birth were analysed by Principal Component Analysis, Hierarchical Cluster Analysis and further supported by Orthogonal Partial Least Square-Discriminant Analysis, revealing three phases of milk maturation: days 1â6 (Phase 1), days 7â20 (Phase 2), and beyond day 20 (Phase 3). While the compositions of Phase 1 milks were essentially indistinguishable among individuals, divergences emerged during the second week of lactation. OPLS regression analysis positioned against the growth rate of one cub tentatively inferred a correlation with changes in the abundance of a trisaccharide, isoglobotriose, previously observed to be a major oligosaccharide in ursid milks.

"Title: Characterization of the Human Exposome by a Comprehensive and Quantitative Large-Scale Multianalyte Metabolomics Platform
Description: The exposome, defined as the cumulative measure of external exposures and associated biological responses throughout the lifespan, has emerged in recent years as a cornerstone in biomedical sciences. Metabolomics stands out here as one of the most powerful tools for investigating the interplay between the genetic background, exogenous, and endogenous factors within human health. However, to address the complexity of the exposome, novel methods are needed to characterize the human metabolome. In this work, we have optimized and validated a multianalyte metabolomics platform for large-scale quantitative exposome research in plasma and urine samples, based on the use of simple extraction methods and high-throughput metabolomic fingerprinting. The methodology enables, for the first time, the simultaneous characterization of the endogenous metabolome, food-related metabolites, pharmaceuticals, household chemicals, environmental pollutants, and microbiota derivatives, comprising more than 1000 metabolites in total. This comprehensive and quantitative investigation of the exposome is achieved in short run times, through simple extraction methods requiring small-sample volumes, and using integrated quality control procedures for ensuring data quality. This metabolomics approach was satisfactorily validated in terms of linearity, recovery, matrix effects, specificity, limits of quantification, intraday and interday precision, and carryover. Furthermore, the clinical potential of the methodology was demonstrated in a dietary intervention trial as a case study. In summary, this study describes the optimization, validation, and application of a multimetabolite platform for comprehensive and quantitative metabolomics-based exposome research with great utility in large-scale epidemiological studies.

The list of enriched chemical classes appears to be very broad and diverse, covering a wide range of compounds from various sources including endogenous metabolites, dietary components, pharmaceuticals, environmental pollutants, and microbial derivatives. While some of the classes (e.g., fatty acids, steroids, flavonoids, vitamins) are expected in a comprehensive metabolomics study of human biofluids, the presence of others like beta-lactams, cephalosporins, isothiocyanates, and quinones suggests that the platform may be specifically designed to capture a broad range of xenobiotics and exposures in addition to endogenous metabolites.

Given the study's stated goal of characterizing the human exposome through a comprehensive and quantitative metabolomics platform, the diverse list of enriched chemical classes seems reasonable and in line with the description. However, without more context on the specific analytical methods employed or the study population, it is difficult to definitively assess the appropriateness of the enrichment results."	"YES, the enrichment results make sense for this study. The study focuses on characterizing the human exposome, which includes a wide range of metabolites originating from various sources such as endogenous metabolism, diet, pharmaceuticals, and environmental exposures. The enriched chemical classes reflect this diversity. For instance:
- Diterpenoids, flavonoids, and flavones indicate plant-derived compounds, likely present in the diet.
- Steroids and fatty acids are typical of endogenous metabolism.
- Pharmaceuticals such as beta-lactam antibiotics and penicillin align with a comprehensive exposome study that includes pharmaceutical exposure.
- Environmental pollutants and microbiota derivatives could contribute to classes like icosanoids, quinones, and isothiocyanates.
- Vitamins, nucleosides, and monosaccharides could indicate dietary and endogenous metabolic processes.

"Title: The effects of different rootstocks on aroma components, activities and genes expression of aroma-related enzymes in oriental melon fruit
Description: <p>Grafting is widely applied in the cultivation of melon. In this study, 'Qinmi No.1' [<em>Cucumis melo </em>L.<em> </em>(QG)] and 'Ribenxuesong' [<em>Cucurbita maxima</em> Duch. (RG)] were used as rootstocks for 'QingxinYangjiaocui' (<em>Cucumis melo</em> L.). The results showed that grafting with muskmelon rootstocks had no significant effect on fruit aroma, but grafting with pumpkin rootstocks significantly reduced the odor intensity and odor preference scores of melon fruits. Compared with the fruits from self-grafted plants (SG), four new aromatic volatiles with a sweet smell were detected, the alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) activity was significantly decreased at 30 DAP, but unaffected at 42 DAP in QG fruits. There was no difference for alcohol acetyltransferase (AAT) activity between QG and SG fruits. The expression level of CmADH2 was significantly higher at 30 DAP and 42 DAP, but CmAAT2 was significantly lower at 42 DAP in QG fruits compared with SG fruits. In RG fruits, the main aroma compounds including butanoic acid ethyl ester, 2-methyl-2-butenal and 2-methylheptan-1-al were absent, while the volatile compounds with unpleasant odor characteristics including trans, cis-2,6-nonadien-1-ol, (E,E)-2,4-heptadienal, octanoic acid and styrene were detected. Compared with SG fruits, 1-nonanol and 1-heptanol with green odor characteristics were significantly increased, but eucalyptol and farnesene with fruity aroma characteristics were significantly decreased in RG fruits. The ADH activity of RG fruits was significantly lower than that of SG fruits at 30 DAP and the AAT activity was significantly lower than that of SG fruits at 42 DAP. In addition, the expression levels of CmADH and CmAAT homologs in RG fruits were significantly lower than those in SG or QG fruits. These results show that grafting with pumpkin rootstocks affected the main aroma components, reduced ADH and AAT activities, and down-regulated the expression levels of CmADHs and CmAATs in the melon fruits. This study reveals the mechanism of different rootstocks on melon fruit aroma quality, and lays a theoretical foundation for the selection of rootstocks in melon production. Future studies using overexpression or CRISPR/CAS system to obtain stable transgenic lines of genes encoding key aromatic volatiles, would be promising to effectively improve the flavor quality of melon.</p>

Explanation:
The study investigated the effects of different rootstocks on aroma components and aroma-related enzyme activities in oriental melon fruit. The description mentions several specific aroma compounds that were detected or affected by the rootstocks, such as:

1. Alcohols (e.g., 1-nonanol, 1-heptanol), which aligns with the enriched class ""fatty alcohol"".
2. Aldehydes (e.g., 2-methyl-2-butenal, 2-methylheptan-1-al), which aligns with the enriched class ""fatty aldehyde"".
3. Esters (e.g., butanoic acid ethyl ester), which could be related to the enriched classes ""fatty acid"" and ""fatty acid methyl ester"".
4. Terpenes (e.g., eucalyptol, farnesene), which could be related to the enriched classes ""diterpenoid"" and ""prenols"".
5. Fatty acids (e.g., octanoic acid), which aligns with the enriched classes ""fatty acid"", ""straight-chain saturated fatty acid"", and ""long-chain fatty acid"".

Additionally, the study mentioned enzymes involved in aroma biosynthesis, such as alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and alcohol acetyltransferase (AAT), which could be related to the enriched classes of alcohols, aldehydes, and esters.

Therefore, the enriched chemical classes encompass many of the aroma compounds and potentially related metabolites investigated in this study, making the enrichment results sensible and relevant."	OTHER. The study focuses on the effects of different rootstocks on the aroma components of melon fruit, particularly looking at changes in volatile compounds such as alcohols, aldehydes, acids, and esters, which are typically involved in odor and aroma profiles. The enriched chemical classes include fatty alcohols, fatty aldehydes, and fatty acids, which align with the volatile compounds mentioned in the study such as 1-nonanol (a fatty alcohol) and butanoic acid ethyl ester (an ester derived from a fatty acid). The presence of macrolides and prenols somewhat aligns, considering diterpenoids and sesquiterpenes can contribute to aroma characteristics. However, the presence of certain classes like alkanes, alkanethiols, hexoses, and oligosaccharides seems less relevant concerning aroma or are not as commonly associated with aromatic properties in fruits. Thus, while some enriched classes make sense given the aroma focus, others may not be directly linked to the primary aim of the study.	1.0	0.5	YES	<p>Grafting is widely applied in the cultivation of melon. In this study, 'Qinmi No.1' [<em>Cucumis melo </em>L.<em> </em>(QG)] and 'Ribenxuesong' [<em>Cucurbita maxima</em> Duch. (RG)] were used as rootstocks for 'QingxinYangjiaocui' (<em>Cucumis melo</em> L.). The results showed that grafting with muskmelon rootstocks had no significant effect on fruit aroma, but grafting with pumpkin rootstocks significantly reduced the odor intensity and odor preference scores of melon fruits. Compared with the fruits from self-grafted plants (SG), four new aromatic volatiles with a sweet smell were detected, the alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) activity was significantly decreased at 30 DAP, but unaffected at 42 DAP in QG fruits. There was no difference for alcohol acetyltransferase (AAT) activity between QG and SG fruits. The expression level of CmADH2 was significantly higher at 30 DAP and 42 DAP, but CmAAT2 was significantly lower at 42 DAP in QG fruits compared with SG fruits. In RG fruits, the main aroma compounds including butanoic acid ethyl ester, 2-methyl-2-butenal and 2-methylheptan-1-al were absent, while the volatile compounds with unpleasant odor characteristics including trans, cis-2,6-nonadien-1-ol, (E,E)-2,4-heptadienal, octanoic acid and styrene were detected. Compared with SG fruits, 1-nonanol and 1-heptanol with green odor characteristics were significantly increased, but eucalyptol and farnesene with fruity aroma characteristics were significantly decreased in RG fruits. The ADH activity of RG fruits was significantly lower than that of SG fruits at 30 DAP and the AAT activity was significantly lower than that of SG fruits at 42 DAP. In addition, the expression levels of CmADH and CmAAT homologs in RG fruits were significantly lower than those in SG or QG fruits. These results show that grafting with pumpkin rootstocks affected the main aroma components, reduced ADH and AAT activities, and down-regulated the expression levels of CmADHs and CmAATs in the melon fruits. This study reveals the mechanism of different rootstocks on melon fruit aroma quality, and lays a theoretical foundation for the selection of rootstocks in melon production. Future studies using overexpression or CRISPR/CAS system to obtain stable transgenic lines of genes encoding key aromatic volatiles, would be promising to effectively improve the flavor quality of melon.</p>	[{'category': 'CHEBI:24026', 'fold_change': 1937.7598254396098, 'original_p_value': 6.07189755231136e-87, 'adjusted_p_value': 1.0929415594160448e-85}, {'category': 'CHEBI:35746', 'fold_change': 8464.865040650406, 'original_p_value': 4.2970064353116296e-52, 'adjusted_p_value': 3.867305791780467e-51}, {'category': 'CHEBI:18310', 'fold_change': 11017.760846560846, 'original_p_value': 1.6791812594232497e-46, 'adjusted_p_value': 1.0075087556539498e-45}, {'category': 'CHEBI:35366', 'fold_change': 155.71584111031348, 'original_p_value': 1.9489965206985906e-19, 'adjusted_p_value': 8.770484343143659e-19}, {'category': 'CHEBI:39418', 'fold_change': 1162.0294642857143, 'original_p_value': 2.012584922919417e-17, 'adjusted_p_value': 7.245305722509901e-17}, {'category': 'CHEBI:4986', 'fold_change': 6197.490476190477, 'original_p_value': 4.546843572916623e-15, 'adjusted_p_value': 1.3640530718749868e-14}, {'category': 'CHEBI:23849', 'fold_change': 84.35546373377085, 'original_p_value': 1.1291316064144361e-13, 'adjusted_p_value': 2.9034812736371217e-13}, {'category': 'CHEBI:26244', 'fold_change': 4957.992380952381, 'original_p_value': 7.251257822791257e-08, 'adjusted_p_value': 1.6315330101280329e-07}, {'category': 'CHEBI:15904', 'fold_change': 195.71022556390977, 'original_p_value': 5.722920398318532e-07, 'adjusted_p_value': 1.1445840796637064e-06}, {'category': 'CHEBI:23899', 'fold_change': 46.1065627490922, 'original_p_value': 4.247036197664409e-05, 'adjusted_p_value': 7.644665155795937e-05}, {'category': 'CHEBI:23824', 'fold_change': 41.4086223353484, 'original_p_value': 5.8325039609749205e-05, 'adjusted_p_value': 9.544097390686234e-05}, {'category': 'CHEBI:25106', 'fold_change': 1770.7115646258505, 'original_p_value': 0.0005645980718427343, 'adjusted_p_value': 0.0008468971077641015}, {'category': 'CHEBI:47908', 'fold_change': 1126.8164502164502, 'original_p_value': 0.0008870837706418217, 'adjusted_p_value': 0.0012282698362732916}, {'category': 'CHEBI:18133', 'fold_change': 359.27481021394067, 'original_p_value': 0.0027796068910450433, 'adjusted_p_value': 0.003573780288486484}, {'category': 'CHEBI:26666', 'fold_change': 298.6742398164085, 'original_p_value': 0.0033426505234754058, 'adjusted_p_value': 0.004011180628170487}, {'category': 'CHEBI:50699', 'fold_change': 225.36329004329008, 'original_p_value': 0.0044276313364335716, 'adjusted_p_value': 0.004981085253487768}, {'category': 'CHEBI:26208', 'fold_change': 141.65692517006804, 'original_p_value': 0.007034826253560935, 'adjusted_p_value': 0.007448639562593931}, {'category': 'CHEBI:35381', 'fold_change': 33.819866172935754, 'original_p_value': 0.0291401673761722, 'adjusted_p_value': 0.0291401673761722}]	m_MTBLS8677_GC-MS_positive__metabolite_profiling_v2_maf	MTBLS8677	The effects of different rootstocks on aroma components, activities and genes expression of aroma-related enzymes in oriental melon fruit

Several of the enriched classes are related to lipids, fatty acids, and other lipid derivatives like glycerophospholipids, fatty acids, icosanoids, diterpenoids, polyunsaturated fatty acids, etc. These classes could be involved in the structure and composition of chromatophores (pigment-containing and light-reflecting cells) like iridophores, which the study identifies as the main basis for color differences.

Steroids are also enriched, which are known to play roles in pigmentation and color patterning in some vertebrates by regulating chromatophore development and distribution.

The enrichment of some carbohydrate classes like monosaccharides and alditols could be related to energy metabolism in chromatophores or associated with glycosylation of proteins/lipids important for their structure and function.

Vitamins like vitamin D are sometimes involved in pigmentation pathways as cofactors.

So in summary, the enriched metabolite classes align well with the findings that iridophore composition and development underlie color variation in this snake species. The molecular details could involve lipids, steroids, carbohydrates and potentially vitamins playing roles in chromatophore biology."	OTHER. The study focuses on the molecular mechanisms underlying color variation in the Asian vine snake, particularly the role of chromatophores and genes like SMARCE1. The enrichment of chemical classes such as glycerophospholipids, fatty acids, and glycerophosphocholine makes sense because lipids and phospholipids are vital components of cell membranes and can influence chromatophore structure and function. The presence of steroid classes could relate to hormone involvement in pigment cell regulation. Some classes like monosaccharides and nucleosides might seem less directly related, but could still be involved in broader metabolic processes affecting cellular function. However, many of the enriched classes (e.g., diterpenoids, tricarboxylic acid) appear unrelated to the specific focus on pigments, suggesting some enrichments may not directly reflect the primary biochemical pathways influencing color variation in reptiles. Thus, while some links between metabolites and chromatophore function exist, the relevance of the full list to the study's focus on color variation is uncertain.	1.0	0.5	YES	<p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> Reptiles exhibit a wide variety of skin colors, which serve essential roles in survival and reproduction.

"Title: Illuminating a plantâs tissue-specific metabolic diversity using computational metabolomics and information theory
Description: While cross-tissue metabolite variations are increasingly regarded as important readouts of tissue-level gene regulatory processes, these have rarely been explored by non-targeted metabolomics. Here we explore tissue-level metabolic specialization in Nicotiana attenuata, an ecological model with rich secondary metabolism by combining tissue-wide non-targeted mass spectral data acquisition, information theory analysis, and MS/MS molecular networks. This analysis was conducted for two different methanolic extracts of 14 tissues and deconvoluted 895 non-redundant MS/MS spectra. Using information theory analysis, anthers were found to harbor the most specialized metabolome and, through MS/MS molecular networks, most unique metabolites of anthers and other tissues were annotated. Finally, tissue-metabolite association maps were used to predict tissue-specific gene functions. Predictions for the function of two UDP-glycosyltransferases in flavonoid metabolism were confirmed by virus-induced gene-silencing. The present workflow allows biologists to amortize the vast amount of data produced by modern MS instrumentation for their quest to understand gene function.
Enriched: 1. icosanoid; 2. diterpenoid; 3. quinic acid; 4. flavones; 5. diol"	0.75	0.3535533905932738	1.0	0.5	2	"YES, the enrichment of icosanoids, diterpenoids, quinic acid derivatives, flavones, and diols among the metabolites detected makes sense given the study's focus on exploring tissue-specific metabolic diversity in Nicotiana attenuata, an ecological model plant known for its rich secondary metabolism.

Icosanoids and diterpenoids are classes of lipid-derived secondary metabolites that play important roles in plant defense and signaling processes. Quinic acid derivatives, such as chlorogenic acids, are common phenolic compounds found in many plant species, including Nicotiana attenuata. Flavones are a subclass of flavonoids, which are widespread plant secondary metabolites with diverse functions, including pigmentation, UV protection, and defense against pathogens and herbivores. Diols are compounds containing two hydroxyl groups, which can be found in various plant metabolites, including carbohydrates, phenolics, and terpenoids.

The enrichment of these chemical classes aligns with the study's objective of characterizing the metabolic diversity across different tissues of Nicotiana attenuata, as secondary metabolites like those listed are often differentially distributed or produced in specific plant tissues and play crucial roles in various physiological processes."	"OTHER. The enrichment results listed are icosanoids, diterpenoids, quinic acid, flavones, and diol. While some of these classes may be relevant or possible due to secondary metabolite diversity, there are some inconsistencies with expectation. Nicotiana attenuata, being a plant of the Solanaceae family, would be expected to have enriched classes typically associated with plant metabolism, such as alkaloids, terpenoids, or phenolic compounds (such as flavonoids and flavones). 

1. Icosanoids are typically derived from fatty acids and more commonly associated with humans and animals than plants, so their enrichment seems odd unless there is a unique or unusual focus in the plant's fatty acid metabolism contributing to this class.
2. Diterpenoids can make sense as they are part of the terpenoid class which is common in plants, involved in growth regulation, and potentially in plant defense.
3. Quinic acid is a common plant metabolite often involved in the biosynthesis of aroma compounds and phenolics, and its enrichment could be justified.
4. Flavones are a type of flavonoid common in many plants, including Nicotiana species, and their enrichment makes sense given the context of flavonoid metabolism being mentioned in the study and the confirmation of UDP-glycosyltransferase functions.
5. Diols can be secondary metabolites or degradation products of more complex plant compounds.

Overall, while flavones and diterpenoids make sense, and quinic acid is plausible, the presence of icosanoids and diols could be less expected, and one would need specific reasons based on experimental data or specific biochemical pathways studied to fully justify their enrichment in this plant-based study. Therefore, while some overlap with plant metabolism exists, there is enough unusual aspect in the enriched classes to categorize it as OTHER."	1.0	0.5	YES	While cross-tissue metabolite variations are increasingly regarded as important readouts of tissue-level gene regulatory processes, these have rarely been explored by non-targeted metabolomics. Here we explore tissue-level metabolic specialization in Nicotiana attenuata, an ecological model with rich secondary metabolism by combining tissue-wide non-targeted mass spectral data acquisition, information theory analysis, and MS/MS molecular networks. This analysis was conducted for two different methanolic extracts of 14 tissues and deconvoluted 895 non-redundant MS/MS spectra. Using information theory analysis, anthers were found to harbor the most specialized metabolome and, through MS/MS molecular networks, most unique metabolites of anthers and other tissues were annotated. Finally, tissue-metabolite association maps were used to predict tissue-specific gene functions. Predictions for the function of two UDP-glycosyltransferases in flavonoid metabolism were confirmed by virus-induced gene-silencing. The present workflow allows biologists to amortize the vast amount of data produced by modern MS instrumentation for their quest to understand gene function.

"Title: Kidney Tissue Targeted Metabolic Profiling of Unilateral Ureteral Obstruction Rats by NMR
Description: Renal interstitial fibrosis is a common pathological process in the progression of kidney disease. A nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) based metabolomics approach was used to analyze the kidney tissues of renal interstitial fibrosis (RIF) rats, induced by unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO). The combination of a variety of statistical methods was used to screen out 14 significantly changed potential metabolites related with multiple biochemical processes including amino acid metabolism, adenine metabolism, energy metabolism, osmolyte change and induced oxidative stress. The exploration of the contralateral kidneys enhanced the understanding of the disease, which was also supported by serum biochemistry and kidney histopathology results. In addition, the pathological parameters (clinical chemistry, histological and immunohistochemistry results) were correlated with the significantly changed differential metabolites related with RIF. This study shows that target tissue metabolomics analysis can be used as a useful tool to understand the mechanism of the disease and provide a novel insight in the pathogenesis of RIF.

The study investigated the metabolic changes in kidney tissues of rats with renal interstitial fibrosis (RIF) induced by unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO). The enriched chemical classes align with the reported findings of altered metabolic pathways, including:

1. Amino acid metabolism (reflected by enrichment of amino acids, quaternary ammonium ions, and related compounds like diols and 2-hydroxydicarboxylic acids)
2. Adenine metabolism (enrichment of nucleosides)
3. Energy metabolism (enrichment of monosaccharides, hexoses, aldoses, and related compounds like alditols)
4. Osmolyte changes (enrichment of monosaccharides, hexoses, and related compounds)
5. Oxidative stress (enrichment of fatty acids, omega-hydroxy fatty acids, and related lipid compounds like fatty alcohols and glycerophosphocholines)

The enrichment results capture the broad metabolic dysregulation associated with RIF, involving amino acid metabolism, nucleotide metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, and lipid metabolism. The presence of tricarboxylic acids also suggests alterations in energy metabolism pathways like the citric acid cycle."	"OTHER. The list of enriched chemical classes shows a variety of biologically relevant compounds, some of which align with the study's focus on metabolic disruptions in kidney disease. For example, fatty acids, nucleosides, and monosaccharides could be relevant to energy metabolism and stress responses in renal tissues. However, some of the classes like ""cation"" and ""quaternary ammonium ion"" are quite broad or nonspecific, which makes it difficult to clearly assess their direct relevance to renal interstitial fibrosis without additional contextual information. Metabolomic alterations such as those in amino acid metabolism and osmolyte changes mentioned in the study description would likely involve specific metabolites within these classes rather than these broad categories. While some sense can be made of the enrichment list, it does not completely align with the detailed changes in specific metabolic pathways suggested by the study description itself."	1.0	0.5	YES	Renal interstitial fibrosis is a common pathological process in the progression of kidney disease.

Description: Metabolite profiling was performed on metabolites extracted from the entorhinal cortex and primary visual cortex of 14-15 month old APOE3/3, APOE3/4 and APOE4/4 mice. Metabolites were run on a TOF Mass Spectrometer using an ANP column. Initial analysis was done in an untargeted manner, and processing was done to determine the differentially expressed metabolites based on their mass and retention times.

The enrichment of fatty acids, glycerophospholipids, nucleosides, and carbohydrates is consistent with a metabolomics study examining metabolic changes in brain regions like the entorhinal cortex and visual cortex of mice models of Alzheimer's disease. These chemical classes are relevant to neuronal function, membrane lipid composition, energy metabolism, and signaling pathways that could be perturbed in neurodegenerative conditions. The presence of enriched steroid, vitamin D, and diterpenoid classes also aligns with the analysis of lipid-soluble metabolites extracted from brain tissue. Overall, the diverse range of enriched metabolite classes corresponds well with the experimental context described.	"OTHER. The enrichment results for this metabolomics study on neuronal hyperactivity in APOE4 mice include a diverse array of chemical classes, many of which are plausible given the context of the study. The brain is metabolically active, and metabolites such as fatty acids, nucleosides, steroids, and glycerophospholipids are commonly implicated in both neuronal functioning and pathology relevant to neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's. Fatty acids, for example, are integral for membrane structure and signaling, which can impact inhibitory tone in neurons. However, some classes such as diterpenoids and vitamin D might not be immediately intuitive in this specific context but could reflect broader disruptions in metabolic pathways that are yet to be fully elucidated in relation to neuronal hyperactivity or APOE4 genotype effects. The presence of many classes of sugars and polysaccharides (e.g., monosaccharide, D-hexose, hexose, aldose, and oligosaccharide) might relate to energy metabolism alterations in neurons.

"Title: NMR-based metabolic profiling provides diagnostic and prognostic information in critically ill children with suspected infection
Description: <p>Sepsis, defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by infection is difficult to distinguish clinically from infection or post-operative inflammation. We hypothesized that in a heterogeneous group of critically ill children, there would be different metabolic profiles between post-operative inflammation, bacterial and viral infection and infection with or without organ dysfunction. 1D 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectra were acquired in plasma samples from critically ill children. We included children with bacterial (nâ=â25) and viral infection (nâ=â30) and controls (nâ=â58) (elective cardiac surgery without infection). Principal component analysis was used for data exploration and partial least squares discriminant analysis models for the differences between groups. Area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values were used to evaluate the models. Univariate analysis demonstrated differences between controls and bacterial and viral infection. There was excellent discrimination between bacterial and control (AUCâ=â0.94), and viral and control (AUCâ=â0.83), with slightly more modest discrimination between bacterial and viral (AUCâ=â0.78). There was modest discrimination (AUCâ=â0.73) between sepsis with organ dysfunction and infection with no organ dysfunction. In critically ill children, NMR metabolomics differentiates well between those with a post-operative inflammation but no infection, and those with infection (bacterial and viral), and between sepsis and infection.</p>

The chemical classes enriched do not seem directly relevant to the study description, which focuses on using NMR-based metabolic profiling to distinguish between different types of infections and inflammation in critically ill children. The enriched classes listed (monosaccharides, fatty acids, tricarboxylic acids, fatty alcohols, diols, cations, quaternary ammonium ions) are quite general and do not provide specific insights into the metabolic pathways or biomarkers that were likely identified in this study. To better assess the relevance of the enrichment results, it would be helpful to have more information about the specific metabolites or metabolic pathways that were found to be altered in the different patient groups.	OTHER. The enrichment results show a range of chemical classes that are potentially involved in metabolic changes associated with infection and sepsis. Monosaccharides, as a major energy source, can be altered due to changes in energy metabolism and immune responses in infections. Fatty acids are involved in inflammation and energy metabolism, which are relevant in infections and sepsis. The tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle is central to energy metabolism, and its alteration could reflect metabolic changes due to organ dysfunction or differing metabolic demands in infections. Fatty alcohols and diols may be related to lipid metabolism and signaling, which could also be impacted. The inclusion of cations and quaternary ammonium ions could relate to changes in electrolyte balance and cellular osmotic regulation during critical illness. The overall enrichment makes sense, considering the physiological alterations in critically ill children, especially under infection and sepsis conditions. However, more specific connections between these chemical classes and distinct types of infections or organ dysfunction would require further explanation through mechanistic studies.	0.5	0.5	YES	<p>Sepsis, defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by infection is difficult to distinguish clinically from infection or post-operative inflammation.

The study investigates the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying color variation in the Asian vine snake. The listed chemical classes seem to be related to a metabolomics analysis, which appears to have been used to study differences in chromatophore (color pigment cell) composition between different color morphs. However, the main findings reported are related to identifying a specific amino acid substitution in the SMARCE1 gene associated with color variation, and elucidating the role of this gene in regulating chromatophore development from neural crest cells. The metabolomics data likely provided supporting evidence for differences in chromatophore composition, but the genetic mapping and functional studies appear to be the core components of this work. Overall, while the chemical class enrichment results are relevant to the metabolomics aspect, they do not directly relate to or explain the key genetic findings reported.	OTHER, while some aspects of the enriched chemical classes make sense, others are less clear in their relation to color variation in snakes. Metabolites like diterpenoids, steroids, fatty acids, and glycerophospholipids could play a role in pigmentation and membrane composition associated with chromatophores. Iridophores, for instance, are known to contain purine pigments and lipid-based materials, which could align with metabolites like fatty acids and glycerophospholipids. However, the presence of metabolites such as diols, icosanoids, and tricarboxylic acid intermediates may not have a direct or well-known role in coloration processes, suggesting some results might be influenced by broader physiological pathways or secondary metabolic processes rather than direct involvement in pigmentation. Additionally, the presence of nucleosides and nucleoside phosphates may reflect more on cellular and chromosomal activities rather than pigmentation directly. Hence, while some enriched classes are plausible, others seem tangential or require further logical connections to the study's focus on coloration.	0.5	0.5	YES	<p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> Reptiles exhibit a wide variety of skin colors, which serve essential roles in survival and reproduction.

Gut microbiota and serum metabolome were analyzed using shotgun metagenomics and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS). 41 controls were included.</p><p><strong>RESULTS:</strong> The gut microbiota in B-CS patients showed greater abundance of Campylobacter and lower Saccharomyces, Deinococcus and Thiomonas (P &lt; 0.05). 13 differential metabolites such as taurocholate and (R)â3âHydroxybutyric acid were identified in B-CS patients. The random forest (RF) models showed that serum metabolome could effectively identify B-CS from healthy controls and RF-metabolomics exhibited perfect discrimination (AUC = 100%, 95% CI: 100% â 100%), which was significantly higher than that achieved by RF-metagenomics (AUC =58.48%, 95% CI: 38.46% â 78.5%). The results of association analysis showed that Campylobacter concisus and taurocholate were significantly positively correlated in B-CS patients with clinical manifestations (P &lt; 0.05).

The enriched chemical classes listed (monosaccharide, aldopentose, aldose, diol) do not seem directly relevant to the study based on the description provided. The study focused on analyzing gut microbiota and serum metabolites in Budd-Chiari syndrome patients. The enriched metabolites mentioned are taurocholate and (R)-3-Hydroxybutyric acid, which are not members of the listed chemical classes. The enrichment results provided do not appear to match the metabolomics findings described in the study.	OTHER, the enrichment of monosaccharide, aldopentose, aldose, and diol classes in the metabolomics study of Budd-Chiari syndrome (B-CS) is somewhat unclear without detailed metabolic pathway analysis or a direct connection to the known pathophysiology of B-CS. Budd-Chiari syndrome primarily affects the liver, and it is generally characterized by venous outflow obstruction, which can lead to metabolic changes. However, the specificity of these enriched classes to the condition is not evidently obvious. Since monosaccharides and related sugar structures like aldopentoses and aldoses suggest basic sugar metabolism, its clear relevance is usually more aligned with energy metabolism or glycemic control but does not typically indicate how these changes might guide clinical management specifically for B-CS. The enrichment of diols further complicates the explanation as diols can arise from various metabolic pathways. Therefore, without additional context about how these enriched pathways interact specifically with the liver pathology in B-CS, it's not definitively clear if these results make sense in the context of B-CS alone. These observations could point towards some systemic change associated with B-CS, but a deeper dive into the metabolic pathways and their connection to the syndrome is necessary to fully interpret these findings.	0.5	0.5	YES	<p><strong>OBJECTIVES:</strong> We investigated the effects of gut microbiota and serum metabolic levels on the patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome (B-CS), and their guidance for clinical management strategies.</p><p><strong>DESIGN:</strong> 214 B-CS subjects including untreated case (n=93) and treated case (n=121), were enrolled in this study.

The list of enriched chemical classes seems to cover a very broad range of compounds, some of which may not be directly relevant to the study's findings on systemic acquired resistance (SAR) in Arabidopsis. The results mentioned increased levels of amino acids, phenolic compounds, nucleotides, and organic acids in local and distal leaves, which aligns with some of the enriched classes like flavonoids, quinic acid, pyrimidine deoxyribonucleosides, and tricarboxylic acids. However, the list also includes many classes like diterpenoids, steroids, fatty alcohols, macrolides, beta-lactams, and others that were not explicitly mentioned in the results. It's possible that some of these compounds were detected but not highlighted as being significantly altered or relevant to SAR. An explanation of how the enriched classes were determined and their potential connections to SAR would provide more context for evaluating the appropriateness of the list.	"OTHER, the enrichment results partially make sense but not entirely. Secondary metabolites like phenolic compounds and flavonoids (flavones, flavanones, flavonoid) are expected to be enriched in studies related to plant defense mechanisms such as systemic acquired resistance (SAR), as these compounds are often involved in plant responses to stress and pathogen attacks. The increased presence of amino acids, nucleosides, and their derivatives (dipeptides, nucleoside, nucleoside phosphate) also makes sense due to their roles in various metabolic and signaling pathways.

However, the presence of classes like diterpenoids, steroids, and icosanoids at the top of the list is somewhat unexpected in the context of SAR-focused studies. Diterpenoids and steroids can be involved in plant defense but are not typically as central as phenolic compounds or flavonoids. The presence of lipids (glycerophospholipid, monoacylglycerol, fatty acids), though potentially relevant to membrane-related responses, might not be the primary focus compared to more directly defense-related metabolites. 

Therefore, while certain enrichments align with the study focus, others may suggest broader metabolic changes beyond the specific scope of SAR and might warrant further investigation."	0.5	0.5	YES	<p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> Systemic acquired resistance (SAR) is a plant defense response that provides long-lasting, broad-spectrum pathogen resistance to uninfected distal leaves following an initial localized infection.

The objective of this study was to compare the blood metabolomic profiles of horses with AM clinical signs with those of healthy co-grazing (Co-G) horses. To do so, plasma samples from 5 AM horses and 11 Co-G horses were investigated using untargeted metabolomics. Metabolomic data were evaluated using unsupervised, supervised, and pathway analyses. Unsupervised principal component analysis performed with all detected features separated AM and healthy Co-G horses. Supervised analyses had identified 1276 features showing differential expression between both groups. Among them, 46 metabolites, belonging predominantly to the fatty acid, fatty ester, and amino acid chemical classes, were identified by standard comparison. Fatty acids, unsaturated fatty acids, organic dicarboxylic acids, and fatty esters were detected with higher intensities in AM horses in link with the toxins' pathological mechanism. The main relevant pathways were lipid metabolism; valine, leucine, and isoleucine metabolism; and glycine metabolism. This study revealed characteristic metabolite changes in the plasma of clinically affected horses, which might ultimately help scientists and field veterinarians to detect and manage AM. The raw data of metabolomics are available in the MetaboLights database with the access number MTBLS2579.

The description states that the identified metabolites belonged predominantly to the fatty acid, fatty ester, and amino acid chemical classes. It does not explicitly mention O-acyl-L-carnitine as an enriched class. Therefore, I cannot determine if this enrichment result makes sense based on the information given.	"OTHER, while the presence of O-acyl-L-carnitine enrichment can indicate a response to muscle injury and energy metabolism changes, which are consistent with rhabdomyolysis and related metabolic disruptions, the primary chemical classes highlighted in the study for differentiation between affected and healthy horses are fatty acids, unsaturated fatty acids, organic dicarboxylic acids, and fatty esters. Enrichment in these classes would be expected based on their noted roles in the study's findings linked to the pathological mechanism of toxins in atypical myopathy. O-acyl-L-carnitine by itself captures aspects of fatty acid metabolism but does not completely align with all the study's highlighted pathways and metabolite classes.

Enrichment in O-acyl-L-carnitine points to potential disruptions in fatty acid oxidation, which could indeed be relevant in a condition of muscle breakdown and energy dysfunction. Thus, while it is associated, other enriched classes would be expected for a complete picture as noted in the study, including the amino acid metabolism pathways that are part of the study's findings."	0.5	0.5	YES	Atypical myopathy (AM) is a severe rhabdomyolysis syndrome that occurs in grazing horses.

The enrichment results provided do not clearly align with the study's conclusions about the importance of aspartate biosynthesis and nitrogen distribution pathways in this organism.

OTHER, the enrichment of nucleoside phosphate and diol in the context of a study focusing on aspartate aminotransferase Rv3722c and nitrogen metabolism is not straightforward. Aspartate aminotransferases are primarily involved in amino acid metabolism, specifically the transamination reactions that convert aspartate into other amino acids. The enrichment of nucleoside phosphates could be relevant if there is a connection between amino acid metabolism and nucleotide synthesis or regulation, as nucleotides are biosynthetically linked to amino acids like aspartate. However, diols do not have a direct or well-known connection to aspartate aminotransferase or nitrogen metabolism pathways.

"Title: Large neutral amino acid levels tune perinatal neuronal excitability and survival
Description: Surprisingly little is known about the critical metabolic changes that neural cells have to undergo during development and how even mild, temporary shifts in this program can influence brain circuitries and behavior. Inspired by the discovery that mutations in SLC7A5, a transporter of metabolically-essential large neutral amino acids (LNAAs), lead to autism, we employed metabolomic profiling to study the metabolic states of the cerebral cortex across different developmental stages. We found that the forebrain undergoes significant metabolic remodeling throughout development, with certain groups of metabolites showing stage-specific changes. But what are the consequences of interfering with this metabolic program? By manipulating Slc7a5 expression in neural cells, we found that the metabolism of LNAAs and lipids are interconnected in the cortex. Deletion of Slc7a5 in neurons perturbs specifically the postnatal metabolic state leading to a shift in lipid metabolism and a stage- and cell- type-specific alteration in neuronal activity patterns, resulting in a long-term circuit dysfunction.

The enriched chemical classes listed do not seem directly relevant to the study's focus on large neutral amino acids (LNAAs) and their impact on neuronal excitability and survival during perinatal development. The description mentions that manipulating the Slc7a5 transporter for LNAAs affects lipid metabolism, but the enriched classes do not include amino acids or lipids/fatty acids. The classes listed appear to be a random assortment of various compound types, some of which (like diterpenoids) are not typically associated with neural metabolism. Unless there is additional context provided, the enrichment results do not align well with the study's stated objectives and findings related to LNAAs and neurodevelopment."	OTHER, the study focuses on the metabolic remodeling of the cerebral cortex with an emphasis on large neutral amino acids like LNAAs and their interconnectedness with lipid metabolism. However, the enriched chemical classes appear to be quite diverse with a mix of nucleosides, lipids, and other metabolites. The presence of fatty alcohols, glycerophosphocholine, O-acyl-L-carnitine, and fatty acids suggests a connection to lipid metabolism, which aligns with the study's findings about shifts in lipid metabolism. Nucleosides and nucleoside phosphates enrichment could potentially connect to the increased nucleoside metabolism during rapid cellular growth and differentiation in development. However, the specific roles of other classes like diterpenoids or icosanoids in the context of LNAA transport and neural development need further explanation to assert that they are a direct consequence of manipulating Slc7a5 expression. Overall, the chemical classes enriched show a potential overlap and indirect linkage but are diverse, so while they may make sense given the network of metabolic pathways involved, the direct connections to LNAA-related neuronal excitability and survival are not immediately clear.	0.5	0.5	YES	Surprisingly little is known about the critical metabolic changes that neural cells have to undergo during development and how even mild, temporary shifts in this program can influence brain circuitries and behavior.

The study is focused on altering serine metabolic pathways and ROS levels in macrolide-resistant strains of Streptococcus suis, a bacterial species. The enriched classes listed, however, appear to be more relevant to eukaryotic systems or mammals, rather than bacteria.

Classes like fatty acids, icosanoids, diterpenoids, steroids, and glycerophospholipids are typically associated with eukaryotic cells and their membranes. Bacteria generally do not produce or utilize these types of compounds.

For a bacterial metabolomics study focusing on serine metabolism and oxidative stress, one might expect to see enrichment of classes like amino acids, nucleotides, organic acids, redox-related metabolites (e.g., glutathione), and perhaps some classes of bacterial lipids like fatty acids or lipopolysaccharides. The listed enriched classes do not seem to align well with the stated goals of the study."	"OTHER. The enrichment results include a wide range of chemical classes, with a strong representation of lipid-related classes such as fatty acids, glycerophospholipids, phosphatidic acid, and trienoic fatty acid. This makes sense because alterations in metabolic pathways, especially those related to serine metabolism, can influence lipid biosynthesis and signaling pathways. Fatty acids and glycerophospholipids play critical roles in cellular membrane structure and function, which could be involved in macrolide resistance mechanisms by altering cell membrane permeability or efflux pump functioning.

Moreover, the inclusion of nucleosides, nucleotide phosphates, and pyrimidine deoxyribonucleosides could be related to DNA/RNA synthesis and repair mechanisms that might be upregulated as a stress or resistance response. The presence of the tricarboxylic acid cycle components suggests altered energy metabolism, which is common in antibiotic-resistant strains.

However, given that the study title and description focus on serine metabolism and ROS (reactive oxygen species) levels, it is not immediately clear how these directly relate to some of the more specific classes like icosanoids or diterpenoids, unless there are downstream effects or indirect pathways involved.

The presence of steroids in the enrichment results is somewhat unexpected, as steroids are not typically associated with bacterial metabolism to a large extent, suggesting the possibility of contamination or cross-reactivity in the metabolites identified.

"Title: Proteomic analysis validates previous findings on wounding-responsive plant hormone signaling and primary metabolism contributing to the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites based on metabolomic analysis in harvested broccoli (Brassica oleracea L. var. italica)
Description: The plant wound-response is a complex process that generates physiological modiï¬cations for protecting the wounded tissue. In this study, tandem mass tag (TMT)-based quantitative proteomic analysis was performed to clarify the comprehensive molecular mechanism for the wound-response of broccoli subjected to two wounding intensities (0.04 and 1.85 m2 kgâ1 for florets and shreds, respectively). Furthermore, integrated proteomic and metabolomic analysis was performed to reveal the interaction among the critical metabolic pathway responses to wounding. The results show that a total of 399 proteins and 266 proteins were identified as differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in florets and shreds broccoli compared to control, respectively. Bioinformatic analysis indicated that the DEPs were mainly involved in metabolism, genetic information processing, cellular process, environmental information processing and organismal systems. Salicylic acid (SA) and ethylene (ET) biosynthesis were more susceptible to being induced by wounding with lower intensities, whereas, jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthesis was more susceptible to being activated by wounding with higher intensities. Some carbohydrate metabolic pathways and amino acid biosynthesis-related pathways such as phenylalanine, cysteine and methionine metabolic pathways were significantly up-regulated, which promotes the precursor levels for phenolic substances and glucosinolate synthesis.

The enrichment of monosaccharides and fatty acids can be related to the metabolic responses involved in wounding, but more context is needed. The study indicates that certain carbohydrate metabolic pathways and amino acid biosynthesis are up-regulated, which could correlate with an increase in monosaccharides used for energy and as precursors for secondary metabolite biosynthesis. Fatty acids might be involved in the formation of metabolites or membranes in response to stress.

"Title: Large neutral amino acid levels tune perinatal neuronal excitability and survival
Description: Surprisingly little is known about the critical metabolic changes that neural cells have to undergo during development and how even mild, temporary shifts in this program can influence brain circuitries and behavior. Inspired by the discovery that mutations in SLC7A5, a transporter of metabolically-essential large neutral amino acids (LNAAs), lead to autism, we employed metabolomic profiling to study the metabolic states of the cerebral cortex across different developmental stages. We found that the forebrain undergoes significant metabolic remodeling throughout development, with certain groups of metabolites showing stage-specific changes. But what are the consequences of interfering with this metabolic program? By manipulating Slc7a5 expression in neural cells, we found that the metabolism of LNAAs and lipids are interconnected in the cortex. Deletion of Slc7a5 in neurons perturbs specifically the postnatal metabolic state leading to a shift in lipid metabolism and a stage- and cell- type-specific alteration in neuronal activity patterns, resulting in a long-term circuit dysfunction.

"Title: Myeloid PFKFB3-mediated glycolysis promotes kidney fibrosis
Description: Excessive renal fibrosis is a common pathology in progressive chronic kidney diseases. Inflammatory injury and aberrant repair processes contribute to the development of kidney fibrosis. Myeloid cells, particularly monocytes/macrophages, play a crucial role in kidney fibrosis by releasing their proinflammatory cytokines and extracellular matrix components such as collagen and fibronectin into the microenvironment of the injured kidney. Numerous signaling pathways have been identified in relation to these activities. However, the involvement of metabolic pathways in myeloid cell functions during the development of renal fibrosis remains understudied. In our study, we initially reanalyzed single-cell RNA sequencing data of renal myeloid cells from Dr. Denbyâs group and observed an increased glycolytic pathway in myeloid cells that are critical for renal inflammation and fibrosis. To investigate the role of myeloid glycolysis in renal fibrosis, we utilized a model of unilateral ureteral obstruction in mice deficient of Pfkfb3, an activator of glycolysis, in myeloid cells (Pfkfb3ÎMÏ) and their wild type littermates (Pfkfb3WT). We observed a significant reduction in fibrosis in the obstructive kidneys of Pfkfb3ÎMÏ mice compared to Pfkfb3WT mice. This was accompanied by a substantial decrease in myeloid cell infiltration, as well as a decrease in the numbers of M1 and M2 macrophages and suppression of macrophage to obtain myofibroblast phenotype in the obstructive kidneys of Pfkfb3ÎMÏ mice. Mechanistic studies indicate that glycolytic metabolites stabilize HIF1Î±, leading to alterations in macrophage phenotypes that contribute to renal fibrosis. In conclusion, our study implicates that targeting myeloid glycolysis represents a novel approach to inhibit renal fibrosis.

The study focuses on the role of glycolytic metabolism in myeloid cells (like macrophages) and how it contributes to kidney fibrosis development. However, the enriched chemical classes listed do not clearly reflect metabolites or pathways directly related to glycolysis or myeloid cell function.

Classes like nucleosides, fatty acids, steroids, and flavonoids are quite broad and not specific to the glycolytic pathway or immune cell metabolism. More relevant classes could have included glycolytic intermediates (e.g., glucose, glucose-6-phosphate, pyruvate), pentose phosphate pathway metabolites, or metabolites related to macrophage activation and function (e.g., succinate, itaconate, inflammatory lipids).

The lack of metabolites directly linked to the study's focus suggests that the enrichment analysis may not have captured the most relevant pathways or that the results provided may be from a different study altogether."	"OTHER. The enrichment results partially make sense in connection with the study's focus on myeloid glycolysis and kidney fibrosis. The presence of nucleoside phosphate and monosaccharide classes align with the glycolysis pathway since nucleosides and sugar phosphates are critical components of intermediary metabolism. The enrichment of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle-related metabolites suggests a possible link between glycolysis and broader energy metabolism alterations.

However, the presence of diterpenoids, flavones, and other non-carbohydrate-related classes such as diterpenoids and flavonoids is less directly connected to glycolysis or inflammation mediated by myeloid cells. These results could suggest additional metabolic changes beyond just glycolysis influencing renal fibrosis or might be due to secondary responses or experimental variations.

Classes like fatty acids, icosanoids, and glycerophospholipids could be relevant due to their roles in cell membrane structure and signaling, potentially affecting myeloid cell function and fibrotic pathways indirectly.

Description: The plant wound-response is a complex process that generates physiological modiï¬cations for protecting the wounded tissue. In this study, tandem mass tag (TMT)-based quantitative proteomic analysis was performed to clarify the comprehensive molecular mechanism for the wound-response of broccoli subjected to two wounding intensities (0.04 and 1.85 m2 kgâ1 for florets and shreds, respectively). Furthermore, integrated proteomic and metabolomic analysis was performed to reveal the interaction among the critical metabolic pathway responses to wounding. The results show that a total of 399 proteins and 266 proteins were identified as differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in florets and shreds broccoli compared to control, respectively. Bioinformatic analysis indicated that the DEPs were mainly involved in metabolism, genetic information processing, cellular process, environmental information processing and organismal systems. Salicylic acid (SA) and ethylene (ET) biosynthesis were more susceptible to being induced by wounding with lower intensities, whereas, jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthesis was more susceptible to being activated by wounding with higher intensities. Some carbohydrate metabolic pathways and amino acid biosynthesis-related pathways such as phenylalanine, cysteine and methionine metabolic pathways were significantly up-regulated, which promotes the precursor levels for phenolic substances and glucosinolate synthesis. Biosynthesis of secondary metabolites was activated by wounding through regulation of critical proteins involved in the corresponding metabolic pathways.

The study describes changes in plant hormone signaling pathways like salicylic acid, ethylene, and jasmonic acid upon wounding, as well as upregulation of amino acid biosynthesis pathways feeding into phenolic compounds and glucosinolates as secondary metabolites. However, the enriched chemical classes provided are flavins, fatty acids, icosanoids, and diterpenoids, which do not directly relate to the metabolic pathways and compounds highlighted in the study. The mismatch suggests these enriched classes may not be relevant or accurate representations of the metabolomic findings described. A more appropriate enrichment might involve classes like phenylpropanoids, indoles, cysteine-derived metabolites, etc. based on the biosynthetic pathways implicated."	"OTHER. The enrichment results contain some expected and some unexpected components in the context of a wounding response study in broccoli. 

Flavin enrichment can be relevant as flavins are involved in redox reactions and can play a role in responses to stress, including wounding. The enrichment of polyunsaturated, long-chain, and general fatty acids might make sense as alterations in lipid metabolism can be part of plant stress responses, such as membrane remodeling or signaling. Icosaid enrichment is somewhat related, as it involves lipid-derived signaling molecules similar to those found in animal systems and could indicate a comparable signaling role in plants.

The enrichment of diterpenoids is related to secondary metabolism, which aligns with the study's focus on secondary metabolite biosynthesis in response to wounding. However, the study emphasizes hormonal signaling with compounds like salicylic acid, ethylene, and jasmonic acid, as well as amino acid-derived and carbohydrate-related pathways for phenolic and glucosinolate synthesis. These specific hormone-related and amino acid-related classes are missing from the enrichment results. This suggests that, while some parts of the enrichment make sense, there are notable absences that make the list unexpected. The presence of diterpenoids aligns somewhat with the secondary metabolite biosynthesis, but the absence of glucosinolates and other more directly related compounds makes the full interpretation unclear."	0.0	0.5	YES	The plant wound-response is a complex process that generates physiological modiï¬cations for protecting the wounded tissue.

"Title: Metabolic profiling of maternal serum of women at high-risk of spontaneous preterm birth using NMR and MGWAS approach
Description: Preterm birth (PTB) is a leading global cause of infant mortality. Risk factors include genetics, lifestyle choices and infection. Understanding the mechanism of PTB could aid the development of novel approaches to prevent PTB. This study aimed to investigate the metabolic biomarkers of PTB in early pregnancy and the association of significant metabolites with participant genotypes. Maternal sera collected at 16 and 20 weeks of gestation, from women who previously experienced PTB (high-risk) and women who did not (low-risk controls), were analysed using 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) metabolomics and genome-wide screening microarray. ANOVA and probabilistic neural network (PNN) modelling were performed on the spectral bins. Metabolomics genome-wide association (MGWAS) of the spectral bins and genotype data from the same participants was applied to determine potential metabolite-gene pathways. Phenylalanine, acetate and lactate metabolite differences between PTB cases and controls were obtained by ANOVA and PNN showed strong prediction at week 20 (AUC = 0.89). MGWAS identified several metabolite bins with strong genetic associations. Cis-eQTL analysis highlighted TRAF1 (involved in the inflammatory pathway) local to a non-coding SNP associated with lactate at week 20 of gestation. MGWAS of a well-defined cohort of participants highlighted a lactate-TRAF1 relationship that could potentially contribute to PTB.

However, the enriched chemical classes listed do not include amino acids, carboxylates, or hydroxycarboxylates.

The enrichment results may have some relevance, particularly in the context of metabolic and genetic pathways involved in preterm birth, but they are not immediately intuitive upon first glance. The study focuses on metabolites such as phenylalanine, acetate, and lactate in the context of preterm birth, along with genetic associations, notably the lactate-TRAF1 relationship. The enrichment of monosaccharides, fatty acids, and tricarboxylic acids could be reasonable as these are common metabolic classes often associated with energy metabolism, which can be perturbed in various physiological and pathological states. However, other listed classes like fatty alcohols, diols, cations, and quaternary ammonium ions are not directly highlighted in the study description. Their enrichment might be explained by broader metabolic disturbances seen in pregnancy complications or the complex interplay of multiple metabolic pathways and genetic factors, but these connections are not as explicitly mentioned in the study summary. Therefore, these results might make sense with a deeper examination of the pathways and gene-metabolite interactions in question, but they are not clearly justified by the study description provided.	0.0	0.5	YES	Preterm birth (PTB) is a leading global cause of infant mortality.

"Title: Phosphorus availability regulates intracellular nucleotides in marine eukaryotic phytoplankton
Description: Phosphorus limitation is pervasive in the oligotrophic surface ocean and marine microorganisms use different strategies to survive, and thrive, at these low nutrient levels. Eukaryotic algae such as diatoms are extremely sensitive to phosphorus limitation and recent transcriptomics work has suggested that multiple cellular processes are affected under these growth conditions. Metabolomics is the systematic study of intra- and extracellular metabolites, i.e. the end products of microbial metabolism. As such, metabolomics complements genomics and transcriptomics through the identification and quantification of metabolic intermediates that reflect cellular physiology. Here, we applied intracellular metabolomics to examine the differential response of the model diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana to phosphate-replete and phosphate-limited growth conditions. We focused on metabolites from the purine and pyrimidine biochemical pathways, due to their role in phosphorus cycling associated with nucleic acid synthesis. Under phosphate-replete conditions, T. pseudonana stored nucleotides with phosphate moieties such as adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) and, to a lesser extent, inosine 5'-monophosphate (IMP). In contrast, under phosphate-limited conditions, T. pseudonana had higher concentrations of adenine, inosine, and adenosine all of which lack phosphate moieties. Furthermore, based on previously published transcriptomics data, T. pseudonana differentially regulates select genes that can alter these nucleic acid precursors through the gain or loss of the phosphate moiety. Thus, our analysis of the metabolomics and transcriptomics data converged upon the sensitivity of the purine biochemical pathway to phosphorus availability.

OTHER. The enrichment results for the chemical classes in the context of examining the response of T. pseudonana to phosphorus availability seem partly relevant but not entirely focused. Given the study's emphasis on nucleotides and their role in phosphorus cycling, we would expect to see nucleotides and nucleoside phosphates prominently enriched, which is somewhat reflected in the list (at positions 4 and 7). However, the top-enriched class is 'diol,' and other classes such as 'diterpenoid,' 'flavin,' '2-hydroxydicarboxylic acid,' 'tricarboxylic acid,' 'fatty acid,' and 'glycerophospholipid' are less likely to be directly related to the primary focus of the study. They might reflect broader metabolic adjustments in the organism but do not directly correspond to intracellular nucleotides and phosphorus availability as described in the study. This suggests that while some of the enriched classes make sense, the list overall does not fully align with the primary biochemical pathways of interest, indicating either secondary effects or background metabolic changes.	0.0	0.5	YES	Phosphorus limitation is pervasive in the oligotrophic surface ocean and marine microorganisms use different strategies to survive, and thrive, at these low nutrient levels.

"Title: Nicotinamide Riboside is Uniquely Bioavailable in People and Mice
Description: Nicotinamide riboside (NR) is in wide use as an NAD+ precursor vitamin. Here we conducted experiments to determine the time and dose-dependent effects of NR on blood, liver and heart NAD+ metabolism in people and mice. We report that human blood cell NAD+ can rise as much as 2.7-fold with a single dose of NR, that NR elevates mouse hepatic NAD+ with distinct and superior pharmacokinetics to those of nicotinic acid (NA) and nicotinamide (Nam), and that single doses of 100, 300, and 1000 mg of NR provide a dose-dependent increase in the blood cell NAD+ metabolome in the first clinical trial of NR pharmacokinetics. We also report that nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide (NAAD), which was not thought to be en route for conversion of NR to NAD+, is formed from NR and that the rise in NAAD is a highly sensitive biomarker of effective NAD+ supplementation.

The study focuses on NR, which is a form of vitamin B3 and a precursor to NAD+. The enriched classes listed (cation, nucleoside phosphate, diterpenoid, icosanoid) do not appear directly relevant to NR, NAD+, or related metabolites.

A more appropriate list of enriched classes might include:

"Title: Large neutral amino acid levels tune perinatal neuronal excitability and survival
Description: Surprisingly little is known about the critical metabolic changes that neural cells have to undergo during development and how even mild, temporary shifts in this program can influence brain circuitries and behavior. Inspired by the discovery that mutations in SLC7A5, a transporter of metabolically-essential large neutral amino acids (LNAAs), lead to autism, we employed metabolomic profiling to study the metabolic states of the cerebral cortex across different developmental stages. We found that the forebrain undergoes significant metabolic remodeling throughout development, with certain groups of metabolites showing stage-specific changes. But what are the consequences of interfering with this metabolic program? By manipulating Slc7a5 expression in neural cells, we found that the metabolism of LNAAs and lipids are interconnected in the cortex. Deletion of Slc7a5 in neurons perturbs specifically the postnatal metabolic state leading to a shift in lipid metabolism and a stage- and cell- type-specific alteration in neuronal activity patterns, resulting in a long-term circuit dysfunction.

"OTHER, the enrichment results present a somewhat mixed picture. While the study focused primarily on large neutral amino acids (LNAAs) and lipid metabolism, the enriched classes offer some insights and some puzzles.

1. Nucleoside phosphate and nucleoside enrichment could be related to the metabolic changes in neural cells, as nucleotides are important for various cellular processes, including those related to energy and signaling.

2. Diterpenoid enrichment is not immediately clear in this context; however, diterpenoids could potentially be involved in cell signaling or membrane biochemistry which are important for neural function.

3. Cation enrichment could tie into neuronal excitability, as ions and their concentrations are crucial for neuronal activity and signaling.

4. Fatty acid enrichment makes sense due to the studyâs emphasis on lipid metabolism interplay with LNAAs, as fatty acids are key components of lipids in cell membranes and could affect neuronal activity and development.

5. Monosaccharides and diols are key components in metabolism but are not directly emphasized in this study. However, changes in overall metabolism during brain development could explain their involvement.

6. Icosanoids relate to lipid signaling molecules, which aligns with the study's lipid focus, hinting at an influence on neuronal activity and circuits.

Overall, some chemical classes align with the studyâs context, while others remain less directly explainable but could represent broader metabolic shifts associated with brain development."	0.0	0.5	YES	Surprisingly little is known about the critical metabolic changes that neural cells have to undergo during development and how even mild, temporary shifts in this program can influence brain circuitries and behavior.

"Title: The accumulation profiles of terpene metabolites in three Muscat table grape cultivars through HS-SPME-GCMS
Description: Aroma is an important parameter for table grapes and wines; terpenes are typical compounds in Muscat-type grape cultivars and can be easily perceived by humans because of their low olfactory threshold. Volatile terpenes contribute directly to the aroma character, while glycoside-bound terpenes are potential aromatic compounds and can be changed to their volatile forms via hydrolysis. With gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and a solid-phase microextraction method, an automatic data analysis platform was constructed; terpene compounds were identified and quantified from three table grape cultivars at three stages during berry development, and the raw data were deposited in MetaboLights. Terpene metabolite accumulation profiles are presented in this article for integrative analysis with the transcriptome data and phenotypic data to elucidate the important candidate genes and mechanism for terpene biosynthesis. Our method has applications in the identification and quantification of terpene compounds with very low or trace concentrations.
