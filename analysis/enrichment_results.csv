MTBLS10416,A metabolic switch orchestrated by IL-18 and the cyclic dinucleotide cGAMP programs intestinal tolerance,"Tissues are exposed to diverse inflammatory challenges that shape future inflammatory responses. While cellular metabolism regulates immune function, how metabolism programs and stabilizes immune states within tissues and tunes susceptibility to inflammation is poorly understood. Here, we describe an innate immune metabolic switch that programs long-term intestinal tolerance. Intestinal interleukin-18 (IL-18) stimulation elicited tolerogenic macrophages by preventing their proinflammatory glycolytic polarization via metabolic reprogramming to fatty acid oxidation (FAO). FAO reprogramming was triggered by IL-18 activation of SLC12A3 (NCC), leading to sodium influx, release of mitochondrial DNA, and activation of stimulator of interferon genes (STING). FAO was maintained in macrophages by a bistable switch that encoded memory of IL-18 stimulation and by intercellular positive feedback that sustained the production of macrophage-derived 2'3'-cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) and epithelial-derived IL-18. Thus, a tissue-reinforced metabolic switch encodes durable immune tolerance in the gut and may enable reconstructing compromised immune tolerance in chronic inflammation.",m_MTBLS10416_LC-MS_alternating_hilic_metabolite_profiling_v2_maf,fatty acid anion,CHEBI:28868,46481.17857142857,2.7243816827772722e-14,2.1795053462218178e-13

MTBLS107,A metabolomics approach to unravel the regulating role of phytohormones towards carotenoid metabolism in tomato fruit. (Zeaxanthin metabolism),"Carotenoids are important secondary metabolites, which have been recognized as an essential component of the human diet because of their valuable beneficial health effects. With this rationale, there is a continuous aim to define the distribution of these compounds in plants, to better understand their metabolism and to increase their concentration levels in fruits and vegetables. This study aimed at deepening the knowledge on the regulatory role of phytohormones in carotenoid metabolism. More specifically, it was envisaged to reveal the phytohormones involved in the metabolism of alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, lycopene, lutein and zeaxanthin. To this purpose, the phytohormone profiles of 50 tomato fruits were determined by high-resolution Orbitrap mass spectrometry and evaluated towards the associated carotenoid levels. Data mining was performed by differential expression and orthogonal partial least squares analyses. This metabolomics approach revealed 5 phytohormonal metabolites, which significantly influenced (Variable Importance in Projection scores =0.80) carotenoid metabolism. These metabolites were identified as cis-12-oxo-phytodienoic acid, cucurbic acid, 2-oxindole-3-acetic acid, 1-acetylindole-3-carboxaldehyde, and cis-zeatin-O-glucoside. The involvement of the individual phytohormones towards carotenoid metabolism was investigated by regression analysis (P values =0.05, R2 varying between 0.280 and 0.760) and statistical correlation (P values =0.01, correlation varying between 0.403 and 0.846). It was concluded that these phytohormones all have significant contributing value in the regulation of carotenoid metabolism, thereby exhibiting down- and up-regulating influences. As a result, this knowledge encloses the potential for improving tomato fruit nutritional quality by targeted control of agronomic conditions, exogenous use of plant bioregulators, or genetic engineering.",m_MTBLS107_study_p_c_metabolite_profiling_mass_spectrometry_v2_maf,long-chain fatty acid,CHEBI:15904,2283.2859649122806,3.187247053349025e-07,9.561741160047074e-07

MTBLS138,Multi-omics phenotyping of the gut-liver axis reveals metabolic perturbations from a low-dose pesticide mixture in rats,"Health effects of pesticides are not always accurately detected using the current battery of regulatory toxicity tests. We compared standard histopathology and serum biochemistry measures and multi-omics analyses in a subchronic toxicity test of a mixture of six pesticides frequently detected in foodstuffs (azoxystrobin, boscalid, chlorpyrifos, glyphosate, imidacloprid and thiabendazole) in Sprague-Dawley rats. Analysis of water and feed consumption, body weight, histopathology and serum biochemistry showed little effect. Contrastingly, serum and caecum metabolomics revealed that nicotinamide and tryptophan metabolism were affected, which suggested activation of an oxidative stress response. This was not reflected by gut microbial community composition changes evaluated by shotgun metagenomics. Transcriptomics of the liver showed that 257 genes had their expression changed. Gene functions affected included the regulation of response to steroid hormones and the activation of stress response pathways. Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of the same liver samples showed that 4,255 CpG sites were differentially methylated.

MTBLS154,Phosphorus availability regulates intracellular nucleotides in marine eukaryotic phytoplankton,"Phosphorus limitation is pervasive in the oligotrophic surface ocean and marine microorganisms use different strategies to survive, and thrive, at these low nutrient levels. Eukaryotic algae such as diatoms are extremely sensitive to phosphorus limitation and recent transcriptomics work has suggested that multiple cellular processes are affected under these growth conditions. Metabolomics is the systematic study of intra- and extracellular metabolites, i.e. the end products of microbial metabolism. As such, metabolomics complements genomics and transcriptomics through the identification and quantification of metabolic intermediates that reflect cellular physiology. Here, we applied intracellular metabolomics to examine the differential response of the model diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana to phosphate-replete and phosphate-limited growth conditions. We focused on metabolites from the purine and pyrimidine biochemical pathways, due to their role in phosphorus cycling associated with nucleic acid synthesis. Under phosphate-replete conditions, T. pseudonana stored nucleotides with phosphate moieties such as adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) and, to a lesser extent, inosine 5'-monophosphate (IMP).

The components of bear milks and their changes with time may be uniquely adapted to nourish relatively immature neonates, protect them from pathogens, and support the maturation of neonatal digestive physiology. Serial milk samples collected from three giant pandas in early lactation were subjected to untargeted metabolite profiling and multivariate analysis. Changes in milk metabolites with time after birth were analysed by Principal Component Analysis, Hierarchical Cluster Analysis and further supported by Orthogonal Partial Least Square-Discriminant Analysis, revealing three phases of milk maturation: days 1–6 (Phase 1), days 7–20 (Phase 2), and beyond day 20 (Phase 3). While the compositions of Phase 1 milks were essentially indistinguishable among individuals, divergences emerged during the second week of lactation. OPLS regression analysis positioned against the growth rate of one cub tentatively inferred a correlation with changes in the abundance of a trisaccharide, isoglobotriose, previously observed to be a major oligosaccharide in ursid milks. Three artificial milk formulae used to feed giant panda cubs were also analysed, and were found to differ markedly in component content from natural panda milk.

Here, we investigated the depletion of 15 structurally diverse drugs by 25 representative gut bacterial strains. This revealed 70 bacteria-drug interactions, 29 of which had not been reported before.</p><p>Over half of the new interactions can be ascribed to bioaccumulation, that is bacteria storing the drug without chemically modifying it, and in most cases without their growth being affected. As a case in point, we studied the molecular basis of bioaccumulation of the widely used antidepressant duloxetine by using click-chemistry, thermal proteome profiling and metabolomics. We find that duloxetine binds to several metabolic enzymes and changes metabolite secretion of the respective bacteria. When tested in a defined microbial community of accumulators and non-accumulators, duloxetine markedly altered the community composition through metabolic cross-feeding. We further validated our findings in an animal model, showing that bioaccumulating bacteria attenuate the behavioral response of Caenorhabditis elegans to duloxetine.</p><p>Taken together, bioaccumulation by gut bacteria might be a common mechanism that alters drug availability and bacterial metabolism, with implications for microbiota composition, pharmacokinetics, side effects and drug responses, likely in an individual manner.</p><p><br></p><p>Linked studies;</p><p><strong>UPLC-MS/MS assays </strong>of <em>Bifidobacterium animalis</em> <em>subsp. lactis</em> are reported in <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS1264' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS1264</strong></a>.</p><p><strong>UPLC-MS/MS assay</strong> of <em>Lacrimispora saccharolytica</em> and <em>Escherichia coli </em>IAI1 is reported in <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS1319' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS1319</strong></a>.</p><p><strong>UPLC-MS/MS assays</strong> of <em>Escherichia coli </em>ED1a, <em>Clostridium saccharolyticum</em>, <em>Escherichia coli </em>IAI1, <em>Streptococcus salivarius</em>, <em>Eubacterium rectale</em>, <em>Lactobacillus plantarum</em> WCFS1 and <em>Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis</em> Il1403 are reported in<a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS1627' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'> <strong>MTBLS1627</strong></a>.</p><p><strong>UPLC-MS/MS assay</strong> of <em>Bacteroides uniformis </em>and <em>Clostridium saccharolyticum</em> is reported in <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS1757' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS1757</strong></a>.</p><p><strong>UPLC-MS/MS assay</strong> of <em>Eubacterium rectale</em> and <em>Streptococcus salivarius</em> is reported in<strong> </strong><a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS1792' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS1792</strong></a>.</p><p><strong>UPLC-MS/MS assay</strong> of <em>Lacrimispora saccharolytica</em> and standards is reported in <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS2885' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS2885</strong></a>.</p><p><br></p>",m_MTBLS1791_LC-MS_negative_direct-infusion_metabolite_profiling_v2_maf,flavin,CHEBI:30527,33.07680382240069,0.0016977988999820138,0.0016977988999820138

MTBLS1906,Characterization of the Human Exposome by a Comprehensive and Quantitative Large-Scale Multianalyte Metabolomics Platform,"The exposome, defined as the cumulative measure of external exposures and associated biological responses throughout the lifespan, has emerged in recent years as a cornerstone in biomedical sciences. Metabolomics stands out here as one of the most powerful tools for investigating the interplay between the genetic background, exogenous, and endogenous factors within human health. However, to address the complexity of the exposome, novel methods are needed to characterize the human metabolome. In this work, we have optimized and validated a multianalyte metabolomics platform for large-scale quantitative exposome research in plasma and urine samples, based on the use of simple extraction methods and high-throughput metabolomic fingerprinting. The methodology enables, for the first time, the simultaneous characterization of the endogenous metabolome, food-related metabolites, pharmaceuticals, household chemicals, environmental pollutants, and microbiota derivatives, comprising more than 1000 metabolites in total. This comprehensive and quantitative investigation of the exposome is achieved in short run times, through simple extraction methods requiring small-sample volumes, and using integrated quality control procedures for ensuring data quality. This metabolomics approach was satisfactorily validated in terms of linearity, recovery, matrix effects, specificity, limits of quantification, intraday and interday precision, and carryover. Furthermore, the clinical potential of the methodology was demonstrated in a dietary intervention trial as a case study. In summary, this study describes the optimization, validation, and application of a multimetabolite platform for comprehensive and quantitative metabolomics-based exposome research with great utility in large-scale epidemiological studies.",m_MTBLS1906_DI-MS___metabolite_profiling_v2_maf,diterpenoid,CHEBI:23849,256.9371324169444,1.0956301809008268e-226,3.725142615062811e-225

MTBLS1906,Characterization of the Human Exposome by a Comprehensive and Quantitative Large-Scale Multianalyte Metabolomics Platform,"The exposome, defined as the cumulative measure of external exposures and associated biological responses throughout the lifespan, has emerged in recent years as a cornerstone in biomedical sciences. Metabolomics stands out here as one of the most powerful tools for investigating the interplay between the genetic background, exogenous, and endogenous factors within human health. However, to address the complexity of the exposome, novel methods are needed to characterize the human metabolome. In this work, we have optimized and validated a multianalyte metabolomics platform for large-scale quantitative exposome research in plasma and urine samples, based on the use of simple extraction methods and high-throughput metabolomic fingerprinting. The methodology enables, for the first time, the simultaneous characterization of the endogenous metabolome, food-related metabolites, pharmaceuticals, household chemicals, environmental pollutants, and microbiota derivatives, comprising more than 1000 metabolites in total.

The methodology enables, for the first time, the simultaneous characterization of the endogenous metabolome, food-related metabolites, pharmaceuticals, household chemicals, environmental pollutants, and microbiota derivatives, comprising more than 1000 metabolites in total. This comprehensive and quantitative investigation of the exposome is achieved in short run times, through simple extraction methods requiring small-sample volumes, and using integrated quality control procedures for ensuring data quality. This metabolomics approach was satisfactorily validated in terms of linearity, recovery, matrix effects, specificity, limits of quantification, intraday and interday precision, and carryover.

Total exercise duration was 30 min for both trials. Blood samples were taken at rest, during and immediately following exercise and at 60 min post exercise. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of plasma identified 43 known metabolites of which 3 demonstrated significant fold changes (HIE300% compared to the HIE150% value) during exercise, 14 post exercise and 23 at the end of the recovery period.

MTBLS1964,Insights into Metabolic Changes Caused by the Trichoderma virens-Maize Root Interaction,"The interactions of crops with root-colonizing endophytic microorganisms are highly relevant to agriculture, because endophytes can modify plant resistance to pests and increase crop yields. We investigated the interactions between the host plant <i>Zea mays</i> and the endophytic fungus <i>Trichoderma virens</i> at 5 days postinoculation grown in a hydroponic system. Wild-type <i>T. virens</i> and two knockout mutants, with deletion of the genes <i>tv2og1</i> or <i>vir4</i> involved in specialized metabolism, were analyzed. Root colonization by the fungal mutants was lower than that by the wild type. All fungal genotypes suppressed root biomass. Metabolic fingerprinting of roots, mycelia, and fungal culture supernatants was performed using ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography coupled to diode array detection and quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry. The metabolic composition of <i>T. virens</i>-colonized roots differed profoundly from that of noncolonized roots, with the effects depending on the fungal genotype. In particular, the concentrations of several metabolites derived from the shikimate pathway, including an amino acid and several flavonoids, were modulated. The expression levels of some genes coding for enzymes involved in these pathways were affected if roots were colonized by the ∆<i>vir4</i> genotype of <i>T. virens</i>. Furthermore, mycelia and fungal culture supernatants of the different <i>T. virens</i> genotypes showed distinct metabolomes. Our study highlights the fact that colonization by endophytic <i>T. virens</i> leads to far-reaching metabolic changes, partly related to two fungal genes. Both metabolites produced by the fungus and plant metabolites modulated by the interaction probably contribute to these metabolic patterns.

MTBLS1964,Insights into Metabolic Changes Caused by the Trichoderma virens-Maize Root Interaction,"The interactions of crops with root-colonizing endophytic microorganisms are highly relevant to agriculture, because endophytes can modify plant resistance to pests and increase crop yields. We investigated the interactions between the host plant <i>Zea mays</i> and the endophytic fungus <i>Trichoderma virens</i> at 5 days postinoculation grown in a hydroponic system. Wild-type <i>T. virens</i> and two knockout mutants, with deletion of the genes <i>tv2og1</i> or <i>vir4</i> involved in specialized metabolism, were analyzed. Root colonization by the fungal mutants was lower than that by the wild type. All fungal genotypes suppressed root biomass. Metabolic fingerprinting of roots, mycelia, and fungal culture supernatants was performed using ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography coupled to diode array detection and quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry. The metabolic composition of <i>T. virens</i>-colonized roots differed profoundly from that of noncolonized roots, with the effects depending on the fungal genotype. In particular, the concentrations of several metabolites derived from the shikimate pathway, including an amino acid and several flavonoids, were modulated. The expression levels of some genes coding for enzymes involved in these pathways were affected if roots were colonized by the ∆<i>vir4</i> genotype of <i>T. virens</i>. Furthermore, mycelia and fungal culture supernatants of the different <i>T. virens</i> genotypes showed distinct metabolomes. Our study highlights the fact that colonization by endophytic <i>T. virens</i> leads to far-reaching metabolic changes, partly related to two fungal genes. Both metabolites produced by the fungus and plant metabolites modulated by the interaction probably contribute to these metabolic patterns.

The random forest (RF) models showed that serum metabolome could effectively identify B-CS from healthy controls and RF-metabolomics exhibited perfect discrimination (AUC = 100%, 95% CI: 100% – 100%), which was significantly higher than that achieved by RF-metagenomics (AUC =58.48%, 95% CI: 38.46% – 78.5%). The results of association analysis showed that Campylobacter concisus and taurocholate were significantly positively correlated in B-CS patients with clinical manifestations (P &lt; 0.05).

MTBLS2328,Discovering potential urinary biomarkers of tomato consumption using untargeted metabolomics,"Tomatoes are one of the most consumed vegetables in the United States, making them an economically and nutritionally important crop. Previous epidemiological and intervention studies have suggested positive health outcomes associated with tomato consumption. To more conclusively understand the relationship between tomato intake and health benefits, an accurate measurement of tomato consumption is required. Current methods rely on self-report dietary assessments which suffer from recall bias or, plasma lycopene analysis which lacks reliability. Urine sampling allows an objective, non- invasive assessment of dietary intake, resulting in a more robust determination of consumption. Untargeted metabolomics allows for detection of differences in small molecules between groups without preconceived bias, allowing for several classes of compounds to be evaluated as potential biomarkers. The objective of this study was to discover putative urinary biomarkers of tomato consumption using untargeted metabolomics. Healthy subjects (n=11) were evaluated on two separate days: on each day they consumed a controlled diet with either red or tangerine tomato juice with breakfast. Two varieties of tomato juices were included in order to understand how variation in tomato source contributes to intake biomarkers observed. Urine was collected at baseline, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 hours. UHPLC-QTOF-MS was used to compare osmolality-normalized urine samples at each time point. Data was collected in both positive and negative modes for comprehensive coverage of metabolites. Raw data was processed using MZmine2. Univariate and multivariate statistical approaches were applied to understand which metabolites were significantly different between urine pre- and-post-tomato consumption. Feature lists were reduced to those that met all three of the following criteria: the compound was significantly different (p<0.05) at every timepoint compared to baseline; the compound had a fold change greater than 2 at every timepoint compared to baseline; the compound had a VIP score greater than 1 for the Partial Least Squares Regression model. We found 99 metabolites in ESI (+) and 46 metabolites in ESI (-) that met these criteria. Online databases were consulted as a first attempt at identifying unknown compounds. Data-independent MS/MS analysis was conducted to generate fragmentation patterns to support feature identification. Authentic standards for naringenin-4-O-glucuronide and naringenin-7-O-glucuronide confirmed their identities in both modes compared to pooled 6 hour urine. Previously reported compounds in urine after tomato consumption, N-caprylhistidinol and N-caprylhistidinol glucuronide were also identified in positive mode with a level 2 confidence, giving more support for future investigation into these compounds as biomarkers.

Univariate and multivariate statistical approaches were applied to understand which metabolites were significantly different between urine pre- and-post-tomato consumption. Feature lists were reduced to those that met all three of the following criteria: the compound was significantly different (p<0.05) at every timepoint compared to baseline; the compound had a fold change greater than 2 at every timepoint compared to baseline; the compound had a VIP score greater than 1 for the Partial Least Squares Regression model. We found 99 metabolites in ESI (+) and 46 metabolites in ESI (-) that met these criteria. Online databases were consulted as a first attempt at identifying unknown compounds. Data-independent MS/MS analysis was conducted to generate fragmentation patterns to support feature identification. Authentic standards for naringenin-4-O-glucuronide and naringenin-7-O-glucuronide confirmed their identities in both modes compared to pooled 6 hour urine. Previously reported compounds in urine after tomato consumption, N-caprylhistidinol and N-caprylhistidinol glucuronide were also identified in positive mode with a level 2 confidence, giving more support for future investigation into these compounds as biomarkers. Several compounds from the features of interest reduced lists could be tentatively identified as metabolites that had undergone phase II reactions prior to urinary excretion. Additional studies will need to be done to test the robustness, analytical performance, stability, and reliability of these compounds.",m_MTBLS2328_LC-MS_positive_reverse-phase_metabolite_profiling_v2_maf,diterpenoid,CHEBI:23849,276.7913653764356,2.2749952617391e-05,2.2749952617391e-05
MTBLS2372,Divergent metabolism between Trypanosoma congolense and Trypanosoma brucei results in differential sensitivity to metabolic inhibition,"Animal African Trypanosomiasis (AAT) is a debilitating livestock disease prevalent across sub-Saharan Africa, a main cause of which is the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma congolense. In comparison to the well-studied T. brucei, there is a major paucity of knowledge regarding the biology of T. congolense. Here, we use a combination of omics technologies and novel genetic tools to characterise core metabolism in T. congolense mammalian-infective bloodstream-form parasites, and test whether metabolic differences compared to T. brucei impact upon sensitivity to metabolic inhibition. Like the bloodstream stage of T. brucei, glycolysis plays a major part in T. congolense energy metabolism. However, the rate of glucose uptake is significantly lower in bloodstream stage T. congolense, with cells remaining viable when cultured in concentrations as low as 2 mM. Instead of pyruvate, the primary glycolytic endpoints are succinate, malate and acetate. Transcriptomics analysis showed higher levels of transcripts associated with the mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, acetate generation, and the glycosomal succinate shunt in T. congolense, compared to T. brucei. Stable-isotope labelling of glucose enabled the comparison of carbon usage between T. brucei and T. congolense, highlighting differences in nucleotide and saturated fatty acid metabolism. To validate the metabolic similarities and differences, both species were treated with metabolic inhibitors, confirming that electron transport chain activity is not essential in T. congolense. However, the parasite exhibits increased sensitivity to inhibition of mitochondrial pyruvate import, compared to T. brucei. Strikingly, T. congolense exhibited significant resistance to inhibitors of fatty acid synthesis, including a 780-fold higher EC50 for the lipase and fatty acid synthase inhibitor Orlistat, compared to T. brucei. These data highlight that bloodstream form T. congolense diverges from T. brucei in key areas of metabolism, with several features that are intermediate between bloodstream- and insect-stage T. brucei.

Like the bloodstream stage of T. brucei, glycolysis plays a major part in T. congolense energy metabolism. However, the rate of glucose uptake is significantly lower in bloodstream stage T. congolense, with cells remaining viable when cultured in concentrations as low as 2 mM. Instead of pyruvate, the primary glycolytic endpoints are succinate, malate and acetate. Transcriptomics analysis showed higher levels of transcripts associated with the mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, acetate generation, and the glycosomal succinate shunt in T. congolense, compared to T. brucei. Stable-isotope labelling of glucose enabled the comparison of carbon usage between T. brucei and T. congolense, highlighting differences in nucleotide and saturated fatty acid metabolism. To validate the metabolic similarities and differences, both species were treated with metabolic inhibitors, confirming that electron transport chain activity is not essential in T. congolense. However, the parasite exhibits increased sensitivity to inhibition of mitochondrial pyruvate import, compared to T. brucei. Strikingly, T. congolense exhibited significant resistance to inhibitors of fatty acid synthesis, including a 780-fold higher EC50 for the lipase and fatty acid synthase inhibitor Orlistat, compared to T. brucei. These data highlight that bloodstream form T. congolense diverges from T. brucei in key areas of metabolism, with several features that are intermediate between bloodstream- and insect-stage T. brucei.

To do so, plasma samples from 5 AM horses and 11 Co-G horses were investigated using untargeted metabolomics. Metabolomic data were evaluated using unsupervised, supervised, and pathway analyses. Unsupervised principal component analysis performed with all detected features separated AM and healthy Co-G horses. Supervised analyses had identified 1276 features showing differential expression between both groups.

MTBLS2579,Metabolomic signatures discriminate horses with clinical signs of atypical myopathy from healthy co-grazing horses,"Atypical myopathy (AM) is a severe rhabdomyolysis syndrome that occurs in grazing horses. Despite the presence of toxins in their blood, all horses from the same pasture are not prone to display clinical signs of AM. The objective of this study was to compare the blood metabolomic profiles of horses with AM clinical signs with those of healthy co-grazing (Co-G) horses. To do so, plasma samples from 5 AM horses and 11 Co-G horses were investigated using untargeted metabolomics. Metabolomic data were evaluated using unsupervised, supervised, and pathway analyses.

Damage to the renal vascular system and subsequent hypoxia are common contributors to both AKI and CKD. Hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) is reported to protect the kidney from acute ischemic damage and a novel HIF stabilizer, FG4592 (Roxadustat), has become available in the clinic as an anti-anemia drug. However, the role of FG4592 in the AKI-to-CKD transition remains elusive. In the present study, we investigated the role of FG4592 in the AKI-to-CKD transition induced by unilateral kidney ischemia-reperfusion (UIR). The results showed that FG4592, given to mice 3 days after UIR, markedly alleviated kidney fibrosis and enhanced renal vascular regeneration, possibly via activating the HIF-1α/vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA)/VEGF receptor 1 (VEGFR1) signaling pathway and driving the expression of the endogenous antioxidant superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2). In accordance with the improved renal vascular regeneration and redox balance, the metabolic disorders of the UIR mice kidneys were also attenuated by treatment with FG4592. However, the inflammatory response in the UIR kidneys was not affected significantly by FG-4592. Importantly, in the kidneys of CKD patients, we also observed enhanced HIF-1α expression which was positively correlated with the renal levels of VEGFA and SOD2.

The results showed that FG4592, given to mice 3 days after UIR, markedly alleviated kidney fibrosis and enhanced renal vascular regeneration, possibly via activating the HIF-1α/vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA)/VEGF receptor 1 (VEGFR1) signaling pathway and driving the expression of the endogenous antioxidant superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2). In accordance with the improved renal vascular regeneration and redox balance, the metabolic disorders of the UIR mice kidneys were also attenuated by treatment with FG4592. However, the inflammatory response in the UIR kidneys was not affected significantly by FG-4592. Importantly, in the kidneys of CKD patients, we also observed enhanced HIF-1α expression which was positively correlated with the renal levels of VEGFA and SOD2.

Damage to the renal vascular system and subsequent hypoxia are common contributors to both AKI and CKD. Hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) is reported to protect the kidney from acute ischemic damage and a novel HIF stabilizer, FG4592 (Roxadustat), has become available in the clinic as an anti-anemia drug. However, the role of FG4592 in the AKI-to-CKD transition remains elusive. In the present study, we investigated the role of FG4592 in the AKI-to-CKD transition induced by unilateral kidney ischemia-reperfusion (UIR). The results showed that FG4592, given to mice 3 days after UIR, markedly alleviated kidney fibrosis and enhanced renal vascular regeneration, possibly via activating the HIF-1α/vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA)/VEGF receptor 1 (VEGFR1) signaling pathway and driving the expression of the endogenous antioxidant superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2). In accordance with the improved renal vascular regeneration and redox balance, the metabolic disorders of the UIR mice kidneys were also attenuated by treatment with FG4592. However, the inflammatory response in the UIR kidneys was not affected significantly by FG-4592. Importantly, in the kidneys of CKD patients, we also observed enhanced HIF-1α expression which was positively correlated with the renal levels of VEGFA and SOD2.

MTBLS359,Metabolomic analysis of the mechanism of action of yerba mate extract on Salmonella Typhimurium,"Background: Salmonella Typhimurium is a gram-negative enteropathogen that infects millions worldwide; the rapid emergence of antibiotic resistant strains has heightened the urgency of developing effective treatment for this pathogen. Previous studies have demonstrated that the aqueous extract of yerba mate (Ilex paraguariensis) provides effective therapy, in vitro, for the drug-resistant S. Typhimurium DT104. Unfortunately, while some of the chemical constituents that contribute to the extract’s antibacterial activity have been identified, the mechanism of action of the extract is still unknown and of crucial importance to its future potential in combating antibiotic resistant bacteria.</br> Results: Yerba mate extract altered central carbon metabolism in S. Typhimurium, reduced catalase activity by means other than direct inhibition, and did not change membrane integrity (except at the initial 0 time point, where differences were not resolved) despite a significant increase in the production of a cell wall precursor. Additional significant differences were observed in the global metabolic regulators alpha-ketoglutarate and acetylphosphate, the energy-related molecule NAD+, and in an unexpected match to the antibacterial compound yohimbine.</br> Conclusions: This work provides the first insight into the mechanism of action of yerba mate extract on S.

MTBLS3800,Metabolomics study of COVID-19 patients in four different clinical stages,"<p>SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) is the coronavirus strain causing the respiratory pandemic COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019). To understand the pathobiology of SARS-CoV-2 in humans it is necessary to unravel the metabolic changes that are produced in the individuals once the infection has taken place. The goal of this work is to provide new information about the altered biomolecule profile and with that the altered biological pathways of patients in different clinical situations due to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

This is done via metabolomics using HPLC-QTOF-MS analysis of plasma samples at COVID-diagnose from a total of 145 adult patients, divided into different clinical stages based on their subsequent clinical outcome (25 negative controls (non-COVID); 28 positive patients with asymptomatic disease not requiring hospitalization; 27 positive patients with mild disease defined by a total time in hospital lower than 10 days; 36 positive patients with severe disease defined by a total time in hospital over 20 days and/or admission at the ICU; and 29 positive patients with fatal outcome or deceased). Moreover, follow up samples between 2 and 3 months after hospital discharge were also obtained from the hospitalized patients with mild prognosis. The final goal of this work is to provide biomarkers that can help to better understand how the COVID-19 illness evolves and to predict how a patient could progress based on the metabolites profile of plasma obtained at an early stage of the infection. In the present work, several metabolites were found as potential biomarkers to distinguish between the end-stage and the early-stage (or non-COVID) disease groups. These metabolites are mainly involved in the metabolism of carnitines, ketone bodies, fatty acids, lysophosphatidylcholines/phosphatidylcholines, tryptophan, bile acids and purines, but also omeprazole. In addition, the levels of several of these metabolites decreased to “normal” values at hospital discharge, suggesting some of them as early prognosis biomarkers in COVID-19 at diagnose.</p>",m_MTBLS3800_LC-MS_negative_reverse-phase_metabolite_profiling_v2_maf,cation,CHEBI:36916,157.92658657929863,1.091302859165634e-06,1.7460845746650143e-06

This is done via metabolomics using HPLC-QTOF-MS analysis of plasma samples at COVID-diagnose from a total of 145 adult patients, divided into different clinical stages based on their subsequent clinical outcome (25 negative controls (non-COVID); 28 positive patients with asymptomatic disease not requiring hospitalization; 27 positive patients with mild disease defined by a total time in hospital lower than 10 days; 36 positive patients with severe disease defined by a total time in hospital over 20 days and/or admission at the ICU; and 29 positive patients with fatal outcome or deceased). Moreover, follow up samples between 2 and 3 months after hospital discharge were also obtained from the hospitalized patients with mild prognosis. The final goal of this work is to provide biomarkers that can help to better understand how the COVID-19 illness evolves and to predict how a patient could progress based on the metabolites profile of plasma obtained at an early stage of the infection. In the present work, several metabolites were found as potential biomarkers to distinguish between the end-stage and the early-stage (or non-COVID) disease groups. These metabolites are mainly involved in the metabolism of carnitines, ketone bodies, fatty acids, lysophosphatidylcholines/phosphatidylcholines, tryptophan, bile acids and purines, but also omeprazole. In addition, the levels of several of these metabolites decreased to “normal” values at hospital discharge, suggesting some of them as early prognosis biomarkers in COVID-19 at diagnose.</p>",m_MTBLS3800_LC-MS_positive_reverse-phase_metabolite_profiling_v2_maf,phosphatidylcholine,CHEBI:64482,1027.5770169394202,2.6789808486755055e-30,9.108534885496719e-30

MTBLS4013,The Bardet-Biedl protein Bbs1 controls photoreceptor outer segment protein and lipid composition,"<h4><strong>Summary</strong></h4><p>Primary cilia are key sensory organelles whose dysfunction leads to ciliopathy disorders such as Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS). Retinal degeneration is common in ciliopathies, since the outer segments (OSs) of photoreceptors are highly specialized primary cilia. BBS1, encoded by the most commonly mutated BBS-associated gene, is part of the BBSome protein complex. Using a new bbs1 zebrafish mutant, we show that retinal development and photoreceptor differentiation are unaffected by Bbs1-loss, supported by an initially unaffected transcriptome. Quantitative proteomics and lipidomics on isolated OSs show that Bbs1 is required for BBSome-entry into OSs and that Bbs1-loss leads to accumulation of membrane-associated proteins in OSs, with enrichment in proteins involved in lipid homeostasis. Disruption of the tightly regulated OS lipid composition with increased OS cholesterol content are paralleled by early functional visual deficits, which precede progressive OS morphological anomalies.

MTBLS7808,"Mechanisms of hepatic steatosis in chickens: integrated analysis of the host genome, molecular phenomes and gut microbiome","<p>Hepatic steatosis is the initial manifestation of abnormal liver functions and often leads to liver diseases such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in humans and fatty liver syndrome in animals. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of a large chicken population consisting of 705 adult hens by combining host genome resequencing, liver transcriptome, proteome and metabolome analysis, as well as microbial 16S rRNA gene sequencing of each gut segment.

Inflammatory injury and aberrant repair processes contribute to the development of kidney fibrosis.

MTBLS8285,Untargeted metabolomics profiling reveals exercise intensity-dependent alterations in Thoroughbred racehorses’ plasma after routine conditioning sessions,"<p>Thoroughbred (TB) racehorses are subjected to rigorous conditioning programs involving exercise sessions of various types, distances and intensities. These programs aim to optimize both their physical and mental capabilities, which are essential to achieve maximal performance. Conventional investigations of exercise-induced metabolic responses typically focus on a limited set of targeted hematological and biochemical parameters. This field study was conducted to comprehensively assess the metabolic responses triggered by exercise sessions routinely used in TB conditioning. To accomplish this, we employed an untargeted metabolomics approach. Blood samples were collected from 10 racehorses at rest and after completing a routine exercise session. The population was subsequently divided into two groups based on the intensity of the exercise performed: a high-intensity group (n = 6, gallop at ± 13.38 m/s, 1400 m) and a moderate-intensity group (n = 4, soft canter at ± 7.63 m/s, 2500 m). The exercise intensity was evaluated through monitoring of speed, heart rate, and targeted hematological and biochemical parameters (e.g., lactatemia, hematocrit, etc). Resting and 30 min post-exercise plasma samples were analyzed using an untargeted metabolomics approach based on ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry. Unsupervised principal component analysis revealed changes in the metabolome from pre- to post-exercise samples with greater alterations following high-intensity exercise. 54 metabolites, mainly related to amino acid, fatty acid, nucleic acid and vitamin metabolism, were altered following high-intensity exercise versus 23 metabolites, mainly related to fatty acid and amino acid metabolism, following moderate-intensity exercise. Untargeted metabolomics complemented the routine biochemical analyses, allowing a more comprehensive exploration of the exercise-induced response to exercises used in routine conditioning. As previously reported by traditional biochemistry, exercise-induced changes in energy metabolism in TB racehorses have been confirmed.

The exercise intensity was evaluated through monitoring of speed, heart rate, and targeted hematological and biochemical parameters (e.g., lactatemia, hematocrit, etc). Resting and 30 min post-exercise plasma samples were analyzed using an untargeted metabolomics approach based on ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry. Unsupervised principal component analysis revealed changes in the metabolome from pre- to post-exercise samples with greater alterations following high-intensity exercise. 54 metabolites, mainly related to amino acid, fatty acid, nucleic acid and vitamin metabolism, were altered following high-intensity exercise versus 23 metabolites, mainly related to fatty acid and amino acid metabolism, following moderate-intensity exercise. Untargeted metabolomics complemented the routine biochemical analyses, allowing a more comprehensive exploration of the exercise-induced response to exercises used in routine conditioning. As previously reported by traditional biochemistry, exercise-induced changes in energy metabolism in TB racehorses have been confirmed. Through metabolomics, the involvement of lipid and amino acid metabolism during routine exercise and recovery has been highlighted, aspects that had previously been largely overlooked in Thoroughbred racehorses.</p>",m_MTBLS8285_LC-MS_negative_reverse-phase_metabolite_profiling_v2_maf,monosaccharide,CHEBI:35381,322.825995287114,1.2057898033054253e-07,2.893895527933021e-07

Through metabolomics, the involvement of lipid and amino acid metabolism during routine exercise and recovery has been highlighted, aspects that had previously been largely overlooked in Thoroughbred racehorses.</p>",m_MTBLS8285_LC-MS_positive_reverse-phase_metabolite_profiling_v2_maf,omega-hydroxy fatty acid,CHEBI:10615,2283.2859649122806,0.0004378769657601373,0.0004378769657601373

There was no difference for alcohol acetyltransferase (AAT) activity between QG and SG fruits. The expression level of CmADH2 was significantly higher at 30 DAP and 42 DAP, but CmAAT2 was significantly lower at 42 DAP in QG fruits compared with SG fruits. In RG fruits, the main aroma compounds including butanoic acid ethyl ester, 2-methyl-2-butenal and 2-methylheptan-1-al were absent, while the volatile compounds with unpleasant odor characteristics including trans, cis-2,6-nonadien-1-ol, (E,E)-2,4-heptadienal, octanoic acid and styrene were detected. Compared with SG fruits, 1-nonanol and 1-heptanol with green odor characteristics were significantly increased, but eucalyptol and farnesene with fruity aroma characteristics were significantly decreased in RG fruits.

MTBLS968,The accumulation profiles of terpene metabolites in three Muscat table grape cultivars through HS-SPME-GCMS,"Aroma is an important parameter for table grapes and wines; terpenes are typical compounds in Muscat-type grape cultivars and can be easily perceived by humans because of their low olfactory threshold. Volatile terpenes contribute directly to the aroma character, while glycoside-bound terpenes are potential aromatic compounds and can be changed to their volatile forms via hydrolysis. With gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and a solid-phase microextraction method, an automatic data analysis platform was constructed; terpene compounds were identified and quantified from three table grape cultivars at three stages during berry development, and the raw data were deposited in MetaboLights.
