# Metabolights Enriched MAF files

All EBI metabolights sample MAF files, enriched with:

- missing SMILES populated using HMDB to CHEBI mappings
- chemical classifications, using CHEBI (`chebi_classifications`)
- chemical classifications, using C3PO (`c3p_classifications`)

See [c3p](https://github.com/cmungall/c3p) for details of how this was generated.
