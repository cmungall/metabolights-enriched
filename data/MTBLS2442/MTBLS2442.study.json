                "description": "<p>Exposure to synthetic and natural chemicals is a major environmental risk factor in the etiology of many chronic diseases. Investigating complex co-exposures is necessary for a holistic assessment in exposome-wide association studies. In this work, a sensitive liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry approach was developed and validated. The assay enables the analysis of more than 80 highly-diverse xenobiotics in urine, serum/plasma and breast milk; with detection limits generally in the pg-ng mL-1 range. In plasma of extremely-premature infants, 27 xenobiotics are identified; including contamination with plasticizers, perfluorinated alkylated substances and parabens. In breast milk samples collected longitudinally over the first 211 days post-partum, 29 analytes are detected, including pyrrolizidine- and tropane alkaloids which have not been identified in this matrix before. A preliminary estimation of daily toxicant intake via breast milk is conducted. In conclusion, we observe significant early-life co-exposure to multiple toxicants, and demonstrate the method's applicability for large-scale exposomics-type cohort studies.</p>",

For the method validation and matrix-matched standards, commercially available pooled AB plasma-derived serum (Sigma Aldrich) was utilized following a comparison to heparinized pooled AB plasma (Innovative Research). The pooled urine was provided by a female volunteer who reduced exposure to xenoestrogen by avoiding foods or cosmetics stored in plastic containers and foods rich in phytoestrogens for 2 days prior to sample collection. Pooled breast milk was provided by the Semmelweis Women\u2019s Clinic in Vienna<strong>[1]</strong>. Urine and breast milk matrices were stored at -20\u2009\u00b0C and the blood-derived matrices were stored at -80\u2009\u00b0C.</p><p><br></p><p>Blood plasma from extremely prematurely born infants (gestational age &lt;28 weeks and birth weight &lt;1\u2009kg) collected on day 28 after delivery were provided by the Department of Neonatology, Pediatric Intensive Care and Neuropediatrics at the Medical University of Vienna and stored at -80\u2009\u00b0C as part of a larger microbiome-focused study<strong>[2]</strong>. Of the 11 male and 10 female subjects, 13 were delivered by caesarean section and 8 vaginally. Gestational ages ranged 25.6\u2009\u00b1\u20091.2 weeks and discharge ages ranged 39.0\u2009\u00b1\u20093.4 weeks. Birth weights ranged 780\u2009\u00b1\u2009149\u2009g and discharge weights ranged 2860\u2009\u00b1\u2009657\u2009g. All parents gave written-informed consent prior to study inclusion. Spanning a period of 3-211 days post-partum, 86 pooled breast milk samples were collected from one 31-year-old mother and stored at -20\u2009\u00b0C until analysis. Multiple samples of pumped breast milk were collected throughout a day and partially up to 48\u2009h with interim storage at 4\u2009\u00b0C, and combined into an aggregate sample. This was done depending on the needs of the mother and the infant, i.e., left-overs not consumed by the infant were mixed at different times of the day. This approach was deemed the best option to obtain representative, pooled samples without interfering with the breast milk consumption of the infant as pointed out before in literature<strong>[1]</strong>, who examined these samples specifically on mycotoxin exposure. On some days, all breast milk was needed for feeding the infant, leaving no sample for laboratory analysis. Informed consent was obtained from all human research participants.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Braun D, Schernhammer E, Marko D, Warth B.

In total 3 independent sample preparations were performed with 2 weeks between each measurement series. Matrix-matched calibration standards were prepared by dissolving the extracted blank sample matrix in the respective solvent standards after evaporation. The multi-analyte standard for calibration was based on the matrix with the highest sensitivity for each analyte. As no certified reference material was available, spiking experiments at 3x the approximate LOQ (limit of quantification defined as a signal-to-noise ratio of 10) and 30x the LOQ were conducted in triplicates. LOQs and LODs (limit of detection defined as a signal-to-noise ratio of 3) and matrix effects in the form of signal suppression or enhancement (SSE evaluated by the ratio of the slope of the matrix-matched calibration and the slope of the solvent calibration) were evaluated once per validation run (n\u2009=\u20093). Linearity was assessed by the regression coefficient R2 (n\u2009=\u20093), but as no specific value is stated in the guidelines, a limit of R2\u2009&gt;\u20090.9 was assumed. Intermediate precisions were calculated as the relative standard deviation between the results of the spiking experiments (n\u2009=\u20099). To assess selectivity, matrix blanks and system blanks were prepared in triplicates by extracting sample matrix and LC-MS grade water, respectively, and screened for interfering peaks. Method repeatability (intra-day precision) was evaluated by the repeated measurement of one validation batch (n\u2009=\u20096).</p><p><br></p><p>The validation guideline suggests applying the Horwitz Equation to calculate the minimum intermediate precision. For most of the spiking concentrations used in this method (&lt; 0.1\u2009ng/mL), employing this equation yields tolerated deviations that were comparably high, i.e., 45% (1\u2009ng/mL), 64% (0.1\u2009ng/mL) and 91% (0.01\u2009ng/mL). Therefore, the decision was made to apply stricter limits. The highest acceptable deviation for the intermediate precision was thus defined as 32% for concentrations &lt; 10\u2009ng/mL, 27% for concentrations between 10 and 100\u2009ng/mL, 23% for concentrations between 100 and 1000\u2009ng/mL and 16% for concentrations &gt; 1000\u2009ng/mL. The same limits were used for the repeatability. A recovery range (defined as the proportion of the detected concentration to the spiked amount that had been added to the blank matrix prior to sample preparation) of 50-120% was accepted for all analytes independent of the spiked concentrations because the quantitative results of the unknown samples were corrected by the respective average recovery.</p>",
