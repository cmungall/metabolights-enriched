                "description": "Fireflies and their luminous courtships have inspired centuries of scientific study. Today firefly luciferase is widely used in biotechnology, but the evolutionary origin of bioluminescence within beetles remains unclear. To shed light on this long-standing question, we sequenced the genomes of two firefly species that diverged over 100 million-years-ago: the North American Photinus pyralis and Japanese Aquatica lateralis. To compare bioluminescent origins, we also sequenced the genome of a related click beetle, the Caribbean Ignelater luminosus, with bioluminescent biochemistry near-identical to fireflies, but anatomically unique light organs, suggesting the intriguing hypothesis of parallel gains of bioluminescence. Our analyses support independent gains of bioluminescence in fireflies and click beetles, and provide new insights into the genes, chemical defenses, and symbionts that evolved alongside their luminous lifestyle.",

This centrifugation crushed the specimen on top of the bead, and allowed the hemolymph to collect at the bottom of the tube. Approximately 5 \u03bcl was obtained. The extracted hemolymph was diluted with 50 \u03bcl methanol to precipitate proteins and other macromolecules. For A. lateralis adult hemolymph, 3 adult male individuals were placed in individual 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes with 5 mm glass beads, and spun at 5000 RPM for 1 min in a benchtop centrifuge. The pooled extracted hemolymph (~5 \u03bcl), was diluted with 50 \u03bcl MeOH, and air dried. The P. pyralis extracted hemolymph was filtered through a 0.2 \u03bcm PFTE filter (Filter Vial, P/No. 15530-100, Thomson Instrument Company), whereas the A. lateralis hemolymph residue was redissolved in 100 \u03bcl 50% MeOH, and then filtered through the filter vial.\n</p>\nFor extraction of P. pyralis larval partial body, the posterior 2 abdominal segments were first cut off from a single laboratory reared larvae (see Appendix 1.3.2 in the paper associated with this study), and the remaining partial body was placed in 180 \u03bcl 50% acetonitrile, and macerated with a pipette tip.  The extract was sonicated in a water bath sonicator for ~10 min, not letting the temperature of the bath go above 50 \u02daC. The extract was then centrifuged (20,000 x g for 10 min), and filtered through a 0.2 \u03bcm PFTE filter (Filter Vial, P/No. 15530-100, Thomson Instrument Company).\n</p>\nFor extraction of A. lateralis larval whole body, laboratory reared A. lateralis larvae were flash frozen in liquid N2, lyophilized, and the whole body (dry weight: 29.1 mg) was placed in 200 \u03bcl 50% methanol, and macerated with a pipette tip. The extract was sonicated in a water bath sonicator for 30 min, centrifuged (20,000 x g for 10 min), and filtered through a 0.2 \u03bcm PFTE filter (Filter Vial, P/No. 15530-100, Thomson Instrument Company).\n</p>\nFor extraction of I. luminosus adult thorax, the mesothorax through the 2 most anterior abdominal segments (ventral lantern containing segment + 1 segment) of a lyophilized I. luminosus adult male (see Appendix 3.3 in the paper associated with this study), was separated from the prothorax plus head and posterior 3 abdominal segments. This mesothorax + abdomen fragment was then placed in 0.5 ml 50% methanol, and macerated with a pipette tip.

This search was performed through the MS2 similarity search module of MZmine2 (v2.30) with parameters (m/z tolerance: 0.0004 m/z or 1 PPM; minimum # of ions to report: 3). This MS2 similarity search revealed 9 putative lucibufagin isomers with highly similar MS2 spectra (see Appendix 4-Figure 21 in the paper associated with this study), which expanded to 17 putative lucibufagin isomers when considering features without MS2 spectra, but with identical exact masses and close retention times (\u0394RT < 2 min) to the previously identified 9 (see Appendix 4-Table 7 in the paper associated with this study). Chemical formula prediction was assigned to each precursor ion using the Chemical formula search module of MZmine2, whereas chemical formula predictions for product ions was performed within MZmine2 using SIRUIS (v3.5.1). The structural identity of the 9 putative lucibufagins detected via the MS2 spectra similarity search was easily interpreted in light that the different chemical formula represented the core lucibufagins that had undergone acetylation (COCH3) or propylation (COCH2CH3), in different combinations. Notably the most substituted isomers, dipropylated lucibufagin ([M+H] m/z 561.2695, RT = 19.54 mins) were close to the edge of the cropped data (20 min), thus it may be possible that more highly substituted lucibufagins with a longer retention times are present, but not detected in the current analysis.\n</p>\nNext, a MS2 similarity search was performed within P. pyralis partial body extract for ions that showed a MS2 spectra similar to that of the dipropylated lucibufagin [M+H]+ ion from the same run ([M+H]+ m/z 561.2738, RT = 19.53). This search was performed through the MS2 similarity search module of MZmine2 (v2.30) with parameters (m/z tolerance: 0.0004 m/z or 1 PPM; minimum # of ions to report: 5).  This MS2 similarity search revealed 14 putative lucibufagin isomers with highly similar MS2 spectra (see Appendix 4-Table 7 in the paper associated with this study).  Complexes, and fragments were manually removed from the analysis. Comparison of the theoretical and observed exact mass indicated that this experimental run had an unusual degree of systematic m/z error, of ~+10 ppm. After manual correction m/z, chemical formula prediction revealed a several putative lucibufagins of unknown structure with nitrogen in their chemical formula, suggesting that the nitrogen containing lucibufagins reported by Gronquist and colleagues from Lucidota atra[1] may be present in P. pyralis larvae.\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Gronquist M, Meinwald J, Eisner T, Schroeder FC.
