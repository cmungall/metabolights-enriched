                "description": "In aquatic invertebrates, the hemolymph functions as a conduit between the host and its environment, hence, maintaining hemolymph microbial homeostasis significantly influences disease pathogenesis. This study examined the critical role of the respiratory glycoprotein hemocyanin as a host factor in modulating hemolymph microbial composition in penaeid shrimp. Shrimp depleted of hemocyanin followed by Vibrio parahaemolyticus infection had a disruption in the niacinamide salvage pathway, which consequently increased total bacteria and relative abundance of the conditional pathogens Vibrio and Shewanella in the hemolymph. Moreover, in vivo knockdown of hemocyanin followed by niacinamide supplementation restored hemolymph microbial homeostasis, mitigating the competitive advantage of Vibrio. Overall, our data present novel insights into the pivotal role of niacinamide metabolism in modulating shrimp hemolymph microbial composition through hemocyanin.",

The samples were vortexed for 30 s and sonicated for 30 min (5 \u00b0C, 40 KHz) before being placed at -20 \u00b0C for 30 min to precipitate the proteins. Next, the samples were centrifuged at 13,000 x g (15 min, 4 \u00b0C), and the collected supernatant was blown dry under nitrogen. The dried samples were re-solubilized with 100 \u00b5L solution (acetonitrile:water, 1:1) and extracted by low-temperature ultrasonication for 5 min (5 \u00b0C, 40 KHz), followed by centrifugation at 13,000 x g (4 \u00b0C, 10 min). The supernatant was transferred to sample vials for LC-MS/MS analysis.</p>",

Firstly, the data matrix&nbsp;was pre-processed, as&nbsp;follows: At least 80% of the metabolic features detected in any set of samples were retained. After filtering, for specific samples with metabolite levels below the lower limit of quantification, the minimum metabolite value was estimated and each metabolic signature was normalized to the sum. To&nbsp;reduce the errors caused by sample preparation and instrument instability, the response intensities of the sample mass spectrometry peaks were normalized using the sum normalization method,&nbsp;to obtain the normalized data matrix.
