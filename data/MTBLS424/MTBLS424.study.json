                "description": "<p><strong>PURPOSE:</strong> Detecting signals of micrometastatic disease in early breast cancer (EBC) patients could improve risk stratification and allow better tailoring of adjuvant therapies. We have previously shown that postoperative serum metabolomic profiles are predictive of relapse in a single-centre cohort of ERnegative EBC patients. Here, we investigated this further using pre-operative serum samples from ER-positive, premenopausal women with EBC who were enrolled in an international phase III trial. </p><p><strong>METHODS:</strong> Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of 590 EBC samples (319 with relapse or =6 years clinical follow up) and 109 metastatic breast cancer (MBC) samples was performed. A Random Forest (RF) classification model was built using a training set of 85 EBC and all MBC samples. The model was then applied to a test set of 234 EBC samples, and a risk of recurrence score was generated based on the likelihood of the sample being misclassified as metastatic. </p><p><strong>RESULTS:</strong> In the training set, the RF model separated EBC from MBC with discrimination accuracy of 84.9%. In the test set, the RF recurrence risk score correlated with relapse, with an area under the curve of 0.747 in receiver operator characteristics analysis. Accuracy was maximised at 71.3% (sensitivity 70.8%, specificity 71.4%). The model performed independently of age, tumor size, grade, HER2 status and nodal status, and also of AdjuvantOnline risk of relapse score<strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>CONCLUSIONS:</strong> In a multicentre group of EBC patients, we developed a model based on preoperative serum metabolomic profiles that was prognostic for disease recurrence, independent of traditional clinicopathological risk factors.</p>",

Both the trials were run by the International Breast Cancer Research Foundation. In the adjuvant trial, 740 premenopausal women with stage II-IIIB hormone receptor (HR)-positive breast cancer received surgical oophorectomy at the time of breast cancer surgery (mastectomy), followed by tamoxifen for 5 years, to investigate the hypothesis that surgery performed during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle would be associated with better outcomes. At the time of enrollment, 231 patients were estimated to be in the luteal phase and were scheduled for immediate surgery; 509 patients were estimated not to be in the luteal phase and were randomized to receive either immediate surgery or surgery scheduled to occur in the predicted mid-luteal phase<strong>[1]</strong>. Blood samples were collected preoperatively in fasted patients on the day of surgery. Frozen sera were initially stored at local sites and then shipped frozen to the United States. Subsequently specimens were shipped still frozen to Italy. No patients were recorded as diabetic. The trial was designed to follow patients for recurrence for at least 6 years, and deidentified clinical outcome data were made available for the purposes of this study. The study was approved at individual participating institutions in the Philippines, Vietnam, and Morocco and/or by supervising Institutional Review Boards for these institutions and at lead investigator's American institutions. The consent processes addressed the use of samples for future research studies. In the metastatic trial, premenopausal patients with ER+ MBC were randomized to undergo oophorectomy surgery as palliative endocrine therapy in either the follicular or the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, followed by tamoxifen<strong>[2]</strong>. Blood samples were collected preoperatively from fasted patients on the day of surgery. Frozen sera were initially stored at local sites and then shipped frozen to the United States. Subsequently specimens were shipped still frozen to Italy. Diabetic status of patients was not recorded.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Love RR, Laudico AV, Van Dinh N, Allred DC, Uy GB, Quang le H, Salvador JD, Siguan SS, Mirasol-Lumague MR, Tung ND, Benjaafar N, Navarro NS Jr, Quy TT, De La Pe\u00f1a AS, Dofitas RB, Bisquera OC Jr, Linh ND, To TV, Young GS, Hade EM, Jarjoura D.
