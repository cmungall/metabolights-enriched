                "description": "Natural variation can be extremely useful in unraveling the determinants of phenotypic trait evolution but has rarely been analyzed with unbiased metabolic profiling to understand how its effects are organized at the level of biochemical pathways. Native populations of Nicotiana attenuata, a wild tobacco species, have been shown to be highly genetically diverse for traits important for their interactions with insects. To resolve the chemodiversity existing in these populations, we developed a metabolomics and computational pipeline to annotate leaf metabolic responses to Manduca sexta herbivory. We selected seeds from 43 accessions of different populations from the southwestern United States\u2014including the well-characterized Utah 30th generation inbred accession\u2014and grew 183 plants in the glasshouse for standardized herbivory elicitation. Metabolic profiles were generated from elicited leaves of each plant using a high-throughput ultra HPLC (UHPLC)-quadrupole TOFMS (qTOFMS) method, processed to systematically infer covariation patterns among biochemically related metabolites, as well as unknown ones, and finally assembled to map natural variation. Navigating this map revealed metabolic branch-specific variations that surprisingly only partly overlapped with jasmonate accumulation polymorphisms and deviated from canonical jasmonate signaling. Fragmentation analysis via indiscriminant tandem mass spectrometry (idMS/MS) was conducted with 10 accessions that spanned a large proportion of the variance found in the complete accession dataset, and compound spectra were computationally assembled into spectral similarity networks. The biological information captured by this networking approach facilitates the mining of the mass spectral data of unknowns with high natural variation, as demonstrated by the annotation of a strongly herbivory-inducible phenolic derivative, and can guide pathway analysis.",

Baldwin and his collaborators in the Southwestern USA and germinated [1]. The well-characterized inbred line \u2018UT\u2019 which we used as a control comparison was collected from southwestern UT in 1996 [2] and has been self-fertilized for 30 generations in glasshouse conditions in Jena, Germany. Metabolic changes induced during Manduca sexta feeding were elicited in a highly synchronized fashion by producing with a fabric pattern wheel three rows of punctures onto each side of the midvein of five fully expanded leaves per plant at rosette stage and immediately applying 1:1 diluted M. sexta oral secretions (OS) to the puncture wounds. Four treated leaves were harvested, pooled, flash-frozen 72 h after elicitation and metabolites were extracted.\n</p>\nRef: </br>\n[1] Krugel T, Lim M, Gase K, Halitschke R and Baldwin IT.

Ions were detected from m/z 50 to 1400 at a repetition rate of 1 Hz. Mass calibration was performed using sodium formate clusters (10 mM solution of NaOH in 50/50% v/v isopropanol/water containing 0.2% formic acid).\n</p>\nidMS/MS datasets were acquired by operating the instrument with an isolation mass 400 Da, an isolation width 300 Da (largest width meaning all mass is accessible) and collision energies set either to 20, 30, 40, 50 ev to cover broad range mass signal fragmentation by collision-induced dissociation (CID). idMS/MS data collection was restricted to ten samples that were initially selected based on the high range of chemical variations within the total sample population that these samples captured. 4 \u00b5l of each of these samples were first analyzed by UHPLC-ESI/qTOF-MS in profile mode (single MS approach, collision energy of 0 ev) using the aforementioned chromatographic conditions with the objective of identifying compound precursors later on associated with molecular fragments as well as of inferring fragmentation patterns due to in-source collision during ionization (low cone voltage settings). The same samples were then analyzed for idMS/MS data acquisition at 4 different collision energy conditions (20, 30, 40 and 50 ev) separately with all detectable mass signals being equally considered as dissociation targets. This resulted into one MS profile dataset (MS1) and 4 CID-derived MS/MS datasets that were then rapidly aligned and post-processed using open source programs.",
