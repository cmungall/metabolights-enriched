                "description": "The early and accurate identification of predictive biomarkers for antiviral treatment efficacy remains a significant clinical challenge, particularly in the management of chronic hepatitis B (CHB). This study aimed to assess whether the plasma metabolome could reliably predict the success of antiviral therapy in CHB patients. We conducted a retrospective analysis on 56 treatment-naive CHB patients at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University from December 2013 to March 2016. Patients were randomly assigned to either a discovery cohort (n=29) or a validation cohort (n=27) and underwent a 48-week treatment regimen of entecavir (ETV) and interferon-alpha (IFN-\u03b1). Based on the outcome of the treatment, patients were classified as HBeAg seroconversion either (High responders, Hrp) or the non-remission group (Low responder, Lrp). Our methodology involved an untargeted analysis of the amine/phenol and carboxylic acid submetabolomes in the CHB patients under treatment, utilizing chemical isotope labeling (CIL) techniques with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS).Several metabolites were identified as having significant diagnostic potential for distinguishing Hrp from Lrp, with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) exceeding those typically clinical indicators. Notably, four metabolites, namely 2-methyl-3-ketovaleric acid, 2-ketohexanoic acid, 6-oxo-1,4,5,6-tetrahydronicotinic acid, and \u03b1-ketoisovaleric acid, demonstrated exceptionally high sensitivity and specificity in both cohorts, nearing 100%. In contrast, the clinical indicators, including HBcAb, log(HBsAg), and HBeAb, demonstrated lower and inconsistent sensitivity and specificity between the discovery and validation cohorts. Using HBcAb as a marker, the sensitivity was 87.5% with 76.9% specificity in the discovery cohort; however, the sensitivity dropped to 46.7% with 91.7% specificity in the validation cohort. Using log(HBsAg), the sensitivity was 84.6% with 69.2% specificity in the discovery cohort, compared to 85.7% sensitivity and 83.3% specificity in the validation cohort. For HBeAb, the separation of Hrp and Lrp had a sensitivity of 87.5% with 69.2% specificity in the discovery cohort, while the validation cohort showed 86.7% sensitivity and 91.7% specificity.",

All patients showed clinical, biochemical, and virological evidence of chronic HBV infection, evidenced by persistent plasma HBsAg positivity for over six months and anti-HBcAg antibody positivity. These patients had not received any prior antiviral treatment and were clinically diagnosed as CHB patients according to the 'Guidelines for the Prevention, Care, and Treatment of Persons with Chronic Hepatitis B Infection' [10]. Exclusion criteria included patients with cirrhosis, concurrent liver cancer, metabolic diseases such as diabetes and hyperthyroidism, co-infection with hepatitis C, other forms of viral hepatitis, HIV infection, neurological or psychiatric abnormalities, and allergies to interferon or entecavir. The research protocol was approved by the hospital's human ethics committee, and informed consent was obtained from all participants.</p><p>The study involved administering immunotherapy and interferon drugs to all participants for a duration of 48 weeks. The treatment plan included the use of the first-line antiviral drug entecavir (ETV) as a nucleotide analog and the selection of interferon alpha (IFN-\u03b1) as an immunomodulator. The drug regimen consisted of subcutaneous injections of PegIFN\u03b1 at a dose of 180 \u00b5g once a wk, and entecavir at doses of 0.5 mg/d. Follow-up assessments were conducted at <strong>baseline</strong>, <strong>24 wk</strong>, and <strong>48 wk</strong> after the initiation of treatment. The main observational indicators included changes in symptoms and signs, hepatitis B markers, HBV DNA levels, liver function, kidney function, blood routine, and the monitoring and recording of relevant adverse reactions.</p><p>Fasting blood samples were collected at designated time points and stored for subsequent analysis. Virological response was defined as a reduction in HBV DNA levels to below the detection limit of 20 IU/mL. HBeAg seroclearance was characterized by a reduction in HBeAg levels to below the detection threshold, with or without HBeAg seroconversion (defined as \u2264 1 S/CO), accompanied by the emergence of HBeAb (hepatitis B e-antibody). Based on the status of HBeAg seroconversion following treatment, patients were classified into two groups: 'High Responder' (<strong>Hrp</strong>) for those who achieved seroconversion, and 'Low Responder' (<strong>Lrp</strong>) for those who did not.&nbsp;</p>",
