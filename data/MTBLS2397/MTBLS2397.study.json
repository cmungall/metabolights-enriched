                "description": "The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) integrates cellular nutrient signaling and hormonal cues to control metabolism. We have previously shown that constitutive nutrient signaling to mTORC1 by means of genetic activation of RagA (RagAGTP) in mice resulted in a fatal energetic crisis at birth. Herein, we have rescued neonatal lethality in RagAGTP mice and found morphometric and metabolic alterations that span glucose, lipid, ketone, bile acid and amino acid homeostasis in adults, and a median lifespan of nine months. Proteomic and metabolomic analyses of livers from RagAGTP mice revealed a failed metabolic adaptation to fasting due to a global impairment in PPAR\u03b1 transcriptional program. These metabolic defects were partially recapitulated by restricting activation of RagA to hepatocytes, and reverted by pharmacological inhibition of mTORC1. Constitutive hepatic nutrient signaling did not cause hepatocellular damage and carcinomas, unlike genetic activation of growth factor signaling upstream of mTORC1. In summary, RagA signaling dictates dynamic responses to feeding-fasting cycles to tune metabolism so as to match the nutritional state.",

RagALSL-Q66L mice were generated in the David M Sabatini laboratory at the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research at Massachusetts Institute of Technology 15. Expression of the RagAQ66L allele (also referred to as RagAGTP) only occurs upon Cre-dependent elimination of the transcriptional STOP cassette on the null RagALSL-Q66L locus. Hemizygous RagAQ66L/LSL-Q66L (referred to as RagAGTP/\u0394) mice were generated by crossing RagAQ66L/+ mice with mice carrying the null allele RagALSL-Q66L. To minimize genetic drift and to maintain maximum genetic representation in the mixed background in which neonatal viability occurred, experimental cohorts were always from F2 generation. For hepatocyte-specific activation of RagA, produced mice that expressed the RagAQ66L variant, in the absence of wild-type RagA, exclusively in the liver. Thus, we crossed RagAGTP/+ mice with RagAfloxed/floxed ; Albumin-Cre transgenic mice 58 to generate RagAfloxed/GTP; Albumin-CreTg mice. Mice with normal Rag GTPase signaling used as controls were RagAGTP/floxed without Albumin-Cre allele, and RagAGTP/+; Albumin-CreTg mice.</p><p><br></p><p>For metabolomic experiments, mice were fasted for 16 h and maintained fasted or allowed to access food ad libitum for 2 h. For serum analysis, mice were bled before the fasting period and when euthanized. Blood samples were obtained in EDTA-free tubes. Serum was obtained after centrifugation of the blood at 10000 x g for 5 min. Liver samples were immediately snap frozen in liquid nitrogen upon euthanasia.</p>",
