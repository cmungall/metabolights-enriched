                "description": "<p>Chimeric MS/MS spectra contain fragments from multiple precursor ions and therefore hinder compound identification in metabolomics. Historically, deconvolution of these chimeric spectra has been challenging and relied upon specific experimental methods that introduce variation in the ratios of precursor ions between multiple MS/MS scans. DecoID introduces a complementary, method-independent approach where database spectra are computationally mixed to match an experimentally acquired spectrum using LASSO regression. When applied to human plasma, DecoID increased the number of identified metabolites by over 30%.</p>",

Mobile phase A was 95% water, 5% acetonitrile with 20 mM ammonium bicarbonate, 0.1% ammonium hydroxide (25% ammonia in water) and 2.5 \u03bcM medronic acid. Mobile phase B was 95% acetonitrile, 5% water (v/v) and 2.5 \u03bcM medronic acid. Medronic acid and/or phosphate alone has been shown to improve peak shapes<strong>[1]</strong>. A Vanquish Horizon UHPLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used at a flow rate of 0.250 ml/min and 40 \u00b0C. The following linear gradient was applied: 0-1 min 90% B, 1-14 min decrease to 25% B, 14-14.5 min 25% B, 15 min 90% B for re-equilibration until 22 min. The flow rate was increased to 0.400 ml/min from 15.5-20 min. The samples were kept at 6 \u00b0C in the autosampler, and the injection volume was 2 \u03bcl.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Spalding JL, Naser FJ, Mahieu NG, Johnson SL, Patti GJ.

The RF lens value was 60%. Data were acquired in data-dependent acquisition (DDA) mode and data-independent acquisition (DIA) mode with a mass range of 67-900 m/z. For DDA, an inclusion list with the m/z values ([M+H]+ for positive mode, [M-H]- for negative mode) for the standard mixture compounds was used. MS1 scans were acquired at a resolution of 120K with an automatic gain control (AGC) target of 2e^5 and a maximum injection time of 200 ms. Different isolation windows of 1, 3, and 5 m/z were used. A normalized collision energy (NCE) of 40% was used. Data were acquired with 15K resolution, an AGC target of 2.5e^4, and a maximum injection time of 50 ms. For DIA, full scans with 60K resolution, an AGC target of 2e^5, and a maximum injection time of 100 ms were acquired. The isolation windows for fragmentation were 20 m/z, the collision energy (NCE) 40%, the resolution 15K, the AGC target 4e^5, and the maximum injection time 22 ms. All isolation windows used for the datasets analyzed can be found in <strong>Table S5</strong> in the paper associated with this study.</p>",
