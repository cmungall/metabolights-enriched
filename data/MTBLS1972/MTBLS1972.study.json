                "description": "Lipids play an important role in coffee bean development, coffee brew and in the effects of coffee on human health. They account for around 17% of the dry bean weight and encompass different classes and subclasses, mostly triacylglycerols (TAG) and a minor quantity of phospholipids (PL) and \u03b2N-alkanoyl-5-hydroxytryptamides (C-5HT). To comprehensive profile these different lipids, it is important to evaluate extraction methods that provide high lipid coverage and to analyze the lipids in high-resolution techniques. In this work, liquid chromatography-high resolution tandem mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS/MS) was employed to comprehensive profile lipids from green Arabica coffee beans and to evaluate the extraction efficiency and lipid coverage of three methods: Bligh-Dyer (BD), Folch (FO), and Matyash (MA). The MA method yielded the greatest number of annotated compounds (131 lipids) compared to the other methods. In the positive electrospray ionization (ESI) mode, the main difference among extraction methods was observed for TAG and diacylglycerols, whereas for the negative ESI it was observed differences for phosphatidylinositol (PI), lysophosphatidylinositol and phosphatidic acid (p < 0.05). The analysis of coffees from different maturation stages and/or post-harvest processes were also performed using the MA method. Immature beans were discriminated from mature and overripe beans by its lower levels of C-5HT, PI, phosphatidylcholine, lysophosphatidylcholine, phosphatidyletanolamine, and lysophosphatidylethanolamine. These results can help to better understand the coffee lipid composition and its association with coffee quality.",

LC-MS grade methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), 2-propanol (IPA), formic acid (FA), ammonium acetate (AmAc) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Taufkirchen, Germany). Pure water was in-house produced by a Milli-Q system (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) and used for the preparation of aqueous solvents.

The study was approved by the Ethical Committee at the Eberhard Karls University T\u00fcbingen and written informed consent was obtained (project-numbers: 264/2013BO2 and 696/2016BO2). Residual tissue samples not used for pathological routine examination were transferred to the laboratory for cell isolation within a maximum of 8 h after surgery.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Organoid Culture and Viability</strong></p><p>Assay Organoid cultures were established and maintained as described previously <strong>[1]</strong>. Human tumor organoids were cultured in the complete medium (advanced DMEM/F12 (Fisher Scientific/gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) supplemented with 10 mM Hepes (Carl Roth GmbH and Co KG, Karlsruhe, Germany), 1\u00d7 Glutamax (Fisher Scientific/gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA), 1\u00d7 penicillin/streptomycin (Fisher Scientific/gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA), 1\u00d7B-27 supplement (Fisher Scientific/gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA), 1\u00d7 N-2 supplement (Fisher Scientific/gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA), 1 mM N-acetylcysteine (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), 50 ng/mL human EGF (Peprotech, London, UK), 10 \u00b5M Y-27632 (Absource Diagnostics, M\u00fcnchen, Germany) and 1.25 \u00b5g/mL amphotericin (MERCK, Darmstadt, Germany)). For cell metabolomics and viability analysis, <strong>organoids </strong>were dissociated to single cells using the TrypLE Express enzyme (Fisher Scientific/gibco, Paisley, UK). Disaggregation was stopped with advanced DMEM/F12 and cells were counted. Cells were suspended in growth factor-reduced MatrigelTM (Corning, Bedford, MA, USA) and the complete culture medium (3:1, v/v). For the protocol evaluation experiments cells were cultured for 3 days in 300 \u00b5L of the complete medium prior to analysis. For the proof-of-concept experiments and the viability analysis, a 5-FU stock solution (10 mM 5-FU in water) was diluted with complete medium to final concentrations of 1, 10 and 100 \u00b5M 5-FU. After preculturing of the cells for 3 days in 300 \u00b5L of complete medium, the medium was replaced by 300 \u00b5L of the corresponding 5-FU solution or by the complete culture medium for control&nbsp;(0 \u00b5M 5-FU). The <strong>organoids </strong>were treated for 24 h and then subjected to the metabolomics analysis. The proof-of-concept experiments were performed in 3 independent biological replicates (passage number 39-72). The CellTiter Glo 3D cell viability assay (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) was used to analyze cell viability according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. In brief, an equal volume of reagent was added to the culture medium, mixed thoroughly, incubated for 30 min at room temperature, and transferred into opaque-walled 96-well plates. The intensity of luminescence was measured using the EnSpire plate reader (PerkinElmer, Hamburg, Germany). In addition, cell death was analyzed using the NucRed Dead 647 ReadyProbes Reagent (ThermoFisher Scientific, Eugene, OR, USA). The reagent was added to the culture medium, incubated for 15 min, and brightfield and fluorescence images (excitation: 642 nm, emission: 661 nm, Cy5 filter cube) were acquired from each well of the 48-well plate using a Cytation 1 Cell Imaging Multi-Mode Reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA).

Chromatography separation was performed in a Waters XSelect CSH C-18 column (150 mm x 2.1 mm; 2.5 \u00b5m particle size) in gradient elution mode using acetonitrile/water (60:40, v/v) as mobile phase A and isopropanol/acetonitrile (90:10, v/v) as mobile phase B, both with 0.1 % formic acid and 10 mM ammonium formate. The gradient elution was as follows: 0-2.0 min 40% B; 2.0-2.1 min 43% B; 2.1-12.0 min 50% B; 12.0-12.1 min 54% B; 12.1-18.0 min 70% B; 18.0-18.1 min 99% B; 18.1-25.0 min 40% B (Zalloua et al., 2019). The column temperature was set to 45 \u00b0C and the solvent flow rate was 0.4 mL.min-1. Sample injection was 5 \u00b5L and samples were analyzed in both positive and negative ESI modes.&nbsp;</p>",

In the proof-of-concept experiments metabolite identification and annotation was performed by comparison of spectral information (accurate mass, fragment ions and/or retention time) acquired in QC samples to available spectral information from databases or from pure standard compounds. MS/MS spectra were accessed by the <strong>Mass Hunter Qualitative Analysis </strong>Software (<strong>Version B.07.00</strong>, Agilent Technologies) and spectral matching was assessed based on scores reported by the indicated&nbsp;search engine (<strong>Tables S2\u2013S5 i</strong>n the paper associated with this study):<strong> MassBank of North America</strong> (MS/MS Similarity Search,<a href=' https://mona.fiehnlab.ucdavis.edu/' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'> https://mona.fiehnlab.ucdavis.edu/</a>),<strong> CEU Mass Mediator </strong>(MS/MS Search) <strong>[39,40]</strong> and <strong>Lipid Annotator</strong> (<strong>Version 1.0,</strong> Agilent Technologies). Score values for spectra matching to selected reference compounds or those provided in the <strong>METLIN Metabolite PCDL</strong> (<strong>Version B.07.00</strong>, Agilent Technologies) were obtained by spectral comparison within the <strong>MassHunter PCDL Manager </strong>Software (<strong>Version B.07.00</strong>, Agilent Technologies).
