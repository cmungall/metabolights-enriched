                "description": "<p>The metabolome includes not just known but also unknown metabolites; however, metabolite annotation remains the bottleneck in untargeted metabolomics. Ion mobility \u2013 mass spectrometry (IM-MS) has emerged as a promising technology by providing multi-dimensional characterizations of metabolites. Here, we curated an ion mobility CCS atlas, namely AllCCS, and developed an integrated strategy for metabolite annotation using known or unknown chemical structures. The AllCCS atlas covers vast chemical structures with &gt;5000 experimental CCS records and ~12 million calculated CCS values for &gt;1.6 million small molecules. We demonstrated the high accuracy and wide applicability of AllCCS with medium relative errors of 0.5-2% for a broad spectrum of small molecules. AllCCS combined with in-silico MS/MS spectra facilitated multi-dimensional match and substantially improved the accuracy and coverage of both known and unknown metabolite annotation from biological samples. Together, AllCCS is a versatile resource that enables confident metabolite annotation, revealing comprehensive chemical and metabolic insights towards biological processes.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Unknown Metabolite Annotation in Mouse Aging assay</strong> is reported in the current study <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS1622' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS1622</strong></a>.</p><p><strong>Known Metabolite Annotation in Different Biological Samples assays</strong> are reported in <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS1693' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS1693</strong></a>.</p>",

Briefly, 10 mg of mouse liver tissues was firstly homogenized with 200 \u03bcl of H2O and 20 ceramic beads (diameter, 0.1 mm) using a homogenizer (Precellys 24, Bertin Technologies) at the low temperature condition. The protein concentration of the homogenized solution was measured with the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Catalog No. 23225, Thermo Fisher) for normalization. 100 \u03bcl of homogenized solution was used for metabolite extraction. A total of 100 \u03bcl of H2O and 800 \u03bcl of solvent mixture of ACN:MeOH (1:1, v/v) was added, and vortexed for 30 s, and sonicated for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C water bath. After incubation for 1 hour at \u221220 \u00b0C, the sample was further centrifuged for 15 min at 13,000 rpm and 4 \u00b0C. The supernatant was collected and evaporated to dryness at 4 \u00b0C. The dry extracts were then reconstituted into 100 \u03bcl of ACN:H2O (1:1, v/v), followed by sonication at 4 \u00b0C for 10 min, and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm and 4 \u00b0C for 5 min to remove the insoluble debris before LC-IM-MS/MS analysis.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Shen X, Wang R, Xiong X, Yin Y, Cai Y, Ma Z, Liu N, Zhu ZJ.

The m/z tolerance was set at 25 ppm, and only [M+H]+ and [M-H]- adducts were considered for positive and negative modes, respectively. The MS-FINDER was used for in-silico MS/MS match, and kept chemical structures within top 3 formulas for unknown metabolite annotation. The known metabolite database (KEGG and HMDB) and the extended database were used for known and unknown metabolite annotation, respectively.</p>",
