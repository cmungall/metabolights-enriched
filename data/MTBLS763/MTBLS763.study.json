                "description": "Negative experiences in early life can induce long-lasting effects on the welfare, health, and performance of farm animals. A delayed placement of chicks in breeding houses has negative effects on their performance, and results in fecal-specific odours detectable by rats. Based on this observation, the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and metabolites from the feces of 12-day-old chickens were screened for early markers of response to stressful events using gas-chromatography and liquid-chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS, LC-HRMS). The low reproducibility of solid-phase micro-extraction of the VOCs followed by GC-MS was not suitable for marker discovery, in contrast to liquid extraction of metabolites from freeze-dried feces followed by GC-MS or LC-HRMS analysis. Therefore, the fecal metabolome from 12-day-old chicks having experienced a normal or delayed placement were recorded by GC-MS and LC-HRMS in two genotypes from two experiments. From both experiments, 25 and 35 metabolites, respectively explaining 81% and 45% of the difference between delayed and control chickens, were identified by orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis from LC-HRMS and GC-MS profiling. The sets of molecules identified will be useful to better understand the chicks\u2019 response to stressful events over time and will contribute to define stress or welfare biomarkers. [Only the data from the GC-MS and LC-HRMS fecal metabolomes are deposed on Metabolights] This study was supported financially by a \u201ccr\u00e9dits incitatifs\u201d grant from the department of Animal Physiology and Livestock Systems (PHASE) at INRA and by a grant from the Integrated Management of Animal Health metaprogram of INRA for the \u201cGISA-WHELP\u201d project (www.gisa.inra.fr/en).",

The delayed group was deprived of feed and water and put in transportation boxes under irregular movement and variable room temperature: 32 \u00b0C (30 min), 21 \u00b0C (90 min), 32 \u00b0C (30 min), and then at 21 \u00b0C with alternated cycles of box movement and immobility for 24 hrs after hatching. These conditions were combined to be closer to the actual suboptimal conditions broiler chicken can live in livestock facilities. The chicks (males and females) originated from Hubbard Classic genotype (Quintin, France) and from the Ross 308 (Aviagen, Angers, France) genotype, which are both standard fast-growing broiler lines.</br>\nThe feces (including urine) of control (C) and delayed fed (D) chicks were sampled individually in buckets at 12 days of age (11 days after delayed placement), 2 hrs after lighting was on, then packaged in closed 2ml glass vials and frozen (-80 \u00b0C) before fecal metabolite extraction.",

The metabolites were further extracted from the mix by 2 ml of ethyl acetate. The organic phase was recovered and evaporated in a SpeedVac (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) at room temperature. Each sample was derivatized by the addition of 70 \u03bcl of a mixture of N,O-bistrifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) and trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS; BSTFA/TMCS: 99/1) and 30 \u03bcl of acetonitrile for 40 min at 80 \u00b0C in a sand bath.

The mixes were centrifuged (15,000 g, 15 min, 4 \u00b0C) to sediment solid particles, then 450 \u00b5l of the supernatant was recovered and put in glass tubes for further solvent evaporation in a SpeedVac at room temperature. The residues were then reconstituted with 200 \u00b5l methanol/water (1:1) followed by centrifugation (20,000 g, 10 min, 4 \u00b0C) before Ultra-High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (UHPLC) separation and mass spectrometry analysis. The instrumental stability was evaluated by multiple injections (n = 6) of a QC sample obtained from a pool of 10 \u03bcl of all samples analyzed. This QC sample was injected once at the beginning of the analysis, every 10 sample injections, and at the end of the run.</br></br>\n\nRef:</br>\n[1] Di\u00e9m\u00e9 B, Lef\u00e8vre A, Nadal-Desbarats L, Galineau L, Madji Hounoum B, Montigny F, et al.

The multistep gradient was programmed as follows: 0\u20131.5 min, 32\u201345% A; 1.5\u20135 min, 45\u201352% A; 5\u20138 min, 52\u201358% A; 8\u201311 min, 58\u201366% A; 11\u201314 min, 66\u201370% A; 14\u201318 min, 70\u201375% A; 18\u201321 min, 75\u201397% A; 21\u201324 min, 97% A. The autosampler (Ultimate WPS-3000 UHPLC system, Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA) temperature was set at 4 \u00b0C, and the injection volume for each sample was 5 \u03bcl.",

                        "description": "GC-MS</br>\nA Shimadzu GC-MS system (Kyoto, Japan) was used. It was composed of an AOC-20S auto-sampler, an AOC-20i auto-injector, a gas chromatograph 2010, and a QP-2010-Plus mass spectrometer. The ion source and interface temperature were 200 \u00b0C and 250 \u00b0C, respectively. The mass spectra of all GC peaks were generated by electron impact (EI) at 70 eV and recorded in a positive total ion monitoring mode scanning the 35\u2013500m/z range (event time=0.2).\n\nLC-HRMS</br>\nLC-HRMS analysis was performed on a UHPLC Ultimate 3000 system (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA), coupled to a Q-Exactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and operated in positive (ESI+) and negative (ESI\u2013) ionization modes. Heated ESI source parameters were a spray voltage of 3.5 kV, capillary temperature of 350 \u00b0C, heater temperature of 250 \u00b0C, sheath gas flow of 35 arbitrary units (AU), auxiliary gas flow of 10 AU, spare gas flow of 1 AU, and tube lens voltage of 60 V for C18. During the full-scan acquisition, which ranged from 58 to 870 m/z, the instrument operated at 70,000 resolution (m/z = 400), with an automatic gain control target of 1 \u00d7 106 charges and a maximum injection time of 250 ms.",
