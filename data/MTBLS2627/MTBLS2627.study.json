                "description": "<p><strong>OBJECTIVE:</strong> Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) is associated with an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes to the mother and fetus. As yet, the metabolic profiles and the association of the clinical features remain obscure.</p><p><strong>METHODS:</strong> Fifty seven healthy pregnant women and 52 patients with ICP were recruited in this study. Plasma samples were obtained from pregnancies who received prenatal care between the 30-36 weeks. Untargeted metabolomics to portray metabolic profiles were performed by LC/MS. Mul- combined with univariate data analysis and statistical analysis were performed to select differential metabolites between ICP and control group. Debiased sparse partial correlation (DSPC) network analysis of differential metabolites was performed to explore the potential mutual regulation among metabolites on the basis of de-sparsified graphical lasso modeling procedure. Pathway analysis was performed using MetaboAnalyst. Linear regression and Pearson correlation analysis were applied to analyze correlations associated with bile acid levels, metabolites, newborn weight and pregnancy outcome in ICP patients.</p><p><strong>RESULTS:</strong> Conspicuous metabolic changes and choreographed metabolic profiles were disclosed: 125 annotated metabolites and eighteen metabolic pathways were disturbed in ICP patients. DSPC networks indicated dense interactions among amino acids and their derivatives, bile acids, carbohydrates and organic acids. The levels of total bile acid were increased in ICP patients with meconium-stained amniotic fluid compared with those without MSAF. Abnormal tryptophan metabolism, elevated long chain saturated fatty acid and estrone sulfate levels, and low antioxidant capacity were relevant to increasing bile acid levels. Correlation analysis showed that newborn body weights were significant correlated with the levels of several bile acids and some metabolites of amino acids.</p><p><strong>CONCLUSION:</strong> The ICP patient showed metabolic disorder, and the levels of a number of metabolites were correlated with TBA levels and neonatal body weights. These results provide us important information to further understand the metabolic characteristics of patients with ICP and adverse pregnancy outcomes.</p>",

Pregnancy outcomes including stillbirth, gestational age at delivery, premature rupture of membrane (PROM), meconium-stained amniotic fluid (MSAF), newborn\u2019s Apgar score, newborn weight and postpartum hemorrhage were recorded in both groups. Maternal demographic data and serum biochemical data were collected at the same time.</p><p><br></p><p>The fasting <strong>blood </strong>sample from each individual was collected into vacutainer EDTA anticoagulated tube. The samples were then centrifuged (1500 x g) for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C. The <strong>plasma </strong>was collected and then stored at -80 \u00b0C for following analysis.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1] </strong>World Medical Association.

The temperature of UPLC column oven was maintained at 25 \u00b0C while the autosampler was set at 4 \u00b0C. The mobile phase contained (A) water with 25 mM ammonia and 25 mM ammonium acetate, and (B) acetonitrile. The elution gradient was set as follows: initial elution with 95% B for 0.5 min; linearly changed B from 95% to 65% for 0.5-7.0 min; linearly changed B from 65 % to 40 % for 7.0-8.0 min; 40 % B maintained for 8.0-9.0 min; linearly decreased B from 40 % to 95 % for 9.0-9.1 min; 95% B maintained for 9.1-12.0 min. The flow rate was 300 \u03bcL/min. The injection volume of each sample was 2 \u03bcL. Solvent blanks and QC samples were inserted in analytical batch every 10 samples to assess the stability of instrument performance. The stability of the system was assessed via the coefficient of variation (CV) of each variable in QC sample.</p>",

Metabolites were further confirmed by matching MS/MS spectra fragmentation similarity with high forward or reverse score values (\u22650.7) based on in-house library of authentic standards. The identifications were manually checked to exclude exogenous compounds. Processing of missed values of each sample was performed with the 'modified 80 % rules'<strong>[1]</strong>. Remaining missing values from samples were imputed with K-nearest neighbors (K=10) using <strong>R </strong>package (version <strong>3.5.2</strong>). Peak area of each variable was normalized by dividing the total area of sample after which values were multiplied by 105 for the ease of presentation. Variables with CV over 30% were deleted in both modes. For multivariate data analysis (MVDA), center and pareto scaling were implemented to all data ahead of MVDA to reduce influence of maximal and minimal values, as well as to reduce noise effects in models. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to show clustering trend and classified information of samples. Subsequently, partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) was used to distinguish UDCA treated group from untreated group based on metabolic characteristics. Orthogonal partial least square discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) was applied to maximize the differences of metabolic profiles between control and ICP groups. The variable importance in the projection (VIP) scores were calculated according to OPLS-DA models. The 7-fold cross-validation and permutation testing was applied to evaluate the predictive ability of the models, respectively. Differential metabolites were selected by multivariate combined with univariate analysis according to the following criteria: VIP &gt; 1.0, FC \u2265 1.2 or \u2264 0.83, P &lt; 0.05.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1] </strong>Yang J, Zhao X, Lu X, Lin X, Xu G.
