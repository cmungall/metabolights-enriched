                "description": "<p>A transmission mode-direct analysis in real time-quadrupole&nbsp;time of flight-mass spectrometry (TM-DART-QTOF-MS)-based analytical method&nbsp;coupled to multivariate statistical analysis was developed to interrogate&nbsp;lipophilic compounds in seawater samples without the need of&nbsp;desalinization. An untargeted metabolomics approach addressed here as&nbsp;seaomics was successfully implemented to discriminate sea surface&nbsp;microlayer (SML) from underlying water (ULW) samples (n=22, 10 paired&nbsp;samples) collected during a field campaign at the Cape Verde islands in&nbsp;September-October 2017. A panel of 11 ionic species detected in all samples&nbsp;allowed sample class discrimination by means of supervised multivariate&nbsp;statistical models. Tentative identification of species enriched at SML&nbsp;samples suggests that fatty alcohols, halogenated compounds, and oxygenated&nbsp;boron-containing organic compounds are available at the surface for&nbsp;water-air transfer processes. A subset of SML samples (n=5) were subject to&nbsp;on-site experiments during the campaign using a lab-to-the-field approach&nbsp;to test their secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation potency. Results&nbsp;from these experiments and the analytical seaomics strategy provide a proof&nbsp;of concept for an approach to identifying organic molecules involved in&nbsp;aerosol formation processes at the water/air interface.</p>",

Samples were split in 8 ml aliquots using 15 ml conical tubes and were subsequently frozen at -20 \u00b0C until lyophilization. Quality control (QC) samples were prepared by mixing equal volumes of all samples including both collection methods before sample lyophilisation (QCALL) and after metabolite extraction and reconstitution in acetonitrile (QCMIX22). Chemical standard mixtures used for analytical method development and as system suitability samples (SSS) were prepared in ultrapure water for sugars, and amino acids, and in methanol/water mixture for lipids and by combining all standards from the three families of compounds. Chemical standard mixtures can be found in Table S2 in the paper associated with this study. The sample preparation blank was prepared with ultrapure water as follows: fresh ultrapure water was stored for 2 days at -20 \u00b0C in a new plastic bottle equivalent to those used for sample collection; subsequently thawed, split in 8 mL aliquots and stored in 15 mL conical tubes at -20 \u00b0C until lyophilization. This protocol was also implemented to prepare commercial seawater samples that were used for analytical method development. Blanks, QCs, SSS, and samples were lyophilized at 0.280 mBar during 48 h using a Christ Alpha 1-4 Freeze dryer. SML samples, UWL samples, QCs, and SSS were lyophilized with sample blanks in different batches to avoid possible cross-contamination. Lyophilized samples were shipped from TROPOS (Germany) to CIBION-CONICET (Argentina), where they were stored at -80 \u00b0C until TM-DART-QTOF-MS analysis. Metabolite extraction was performed using acetonitrile, and yielding a concentration factor of 6.67. Reconstituted samples were vortex-mixed during 5 min, and centrifuged during 10 min at 4861 \u00d7 g and 20 \u00b0C. For each sample, 500 \u00b5l of supernatant were collected for further analysis.&nbsp;</p>",

A transmission mode (TM)-DART geometry was implemented for sample analysis, setting a distance of 2.5 cm in the rail holding the source. This allowed using the minimum possible DART-to-sample distance to provide the greatest sensitivity [1]. A protocol for calibrating the mass spectrometer across the range of m/z 50-850 using the DART source operated in TM was developed using a mixture of standards prepared in a water-methanol solution (1:1 v/v) that would provide almost equidistant m/z peaks. Signals of different adduct ions from 2-cyanoguanidine, enalapril maleate, mercaptosuccinic acid, 2-amino-4,5-dimethoxybenzoic acid, flecainide acetate, and lacosamide were used for the TOF calibration. The list of m/z values utilized for the TOF calibration can be found in Table S3 in the paper associated with this study. Drift correction was performed after data acquisition using stearic acid present as an ambient contaminant. The [M-H]- adduct ion with m/z 283.2643 was chosen as a lock mass to have a high degree of accuracy in exact mass measurement. Data were acquired in continuum mode in the range of m/z 50-850, and the scan time was set to 1 s.</p><p><br></p><p>For TM-DART-QTOF-MS/MS experiments, the product ion mass spectra were acquired with collision cell voltages between 10 and 40 V, depending on the analyte. Ultra-high-purity argon (\u226599.999%) was used as the collision gas. Data acquisition and processing were carried out using MassLynx version 4.1 (Waters Corp., Milford, MA, USA). Data were acquired for each spot, and acquisition over each mesh was automatically performed through synchronization between the DART software (IonSense Inc.) and MassLynx (Waters Corp.). System suitability procedures were performed to verify that the method and associated instrumentation were fully functioning before and during the analysis of experimental samples.</p><p><br></p><p>Ref:</p><p>[1] Jones, C.

The analysis of fragment ions detected in tandem MS experiments together with neutral loss analysis provided information regarding functional groups and contributed to filter molecular formulae obtained by accurate mass, and isotopic pattern analysis. Two different quadrupole mass windows of 6 and 1 Da were used in tandem MS experiments to mitigate this problem. The mass window of 6 Da allowed investigating the complete isotopic profile with high sensitivity at expense of lower selectivity than the narrower mass window. In contrast, the mass window of 1 Da provided more confidence in the identification of product ions with higher selectivity at the expense of lower sensitivity than the broader mass window.</p>",
