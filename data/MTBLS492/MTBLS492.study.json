                "description": "Metagenomic sequencing provides a window into microbial community structure and metabolic potential; however, linking these data to exogenous metabolites that microorganisms process and produce (the exometabolome) remains challenging. Previously, we observed strong exometabolite niche partitioning among bacterial isolates from biological soil crust (biocrust). Here we examine native biocrust to determine if these patterns are reproduced in the environment. Overall, most soil metabolites display the expected relationship (positive or negative correlation) with four dominant bacteria following a wetting event and across biocrust developmental stages. For metabolites that were previously found to be consumed by an isolate, 70% are negatively correlated with the abundance of the isolate\u2019s closest matching environmental relative in situ, whereas for released metabolites, 67% were positively correlated. Our results demonstrate that metabolite profiling, shotgun sequencing and exometabolomics may be successfully integrated to functionally link microbial community structure with environmental chemistry in biocrust.",

                        "description": "Petri dishes (6 cm^2 x 1 cm depth) were used to core biocrust samples from the Green Butte Site near Canyonlands National Park (38\u00b042'54.1'' N, 109\u00b041'27.0'' W, Moab, UT, USA). Samples were collected along an apparent maturity gradient of Cyanobacteria-dominated biocrusts ranging from light, young (level A) to darker, more mature (level D) (see Supplementary Fig. 1 in the paper associated with this study). Dry samples collected in the field were maintained in a dark desiccation chamber in the laboratory for approximately 11 months until lab-based experiments were performed consistent with previous reports[1]. Biocrusts are adapted to prolonged desiccation though it is important to note that the duration of desiccation likely affects metabolite composition and biological responses.\n</p>\nBiocrust (0.5 g) was transferred to each well within 12-well plates. Sterile LC/MS-grade water (1 ml) was added to each sample and placed under a 12 h light (~300 \u03bcmol photons/m^(2)s)/12 h dark cycle. Microcosms were completely enclosed by aluminum foil to prevent infiltration by outside light sources. At each time point (3 min, 9 h, 18 h, 42 h and 49.5 h), biocrust and soil water were removed and placed in 2 ml Eppendorf tubes and 500 \u03bcl of additional water was used to rinse out the wells and added to the sample. Tubes were centrifuged at 5000 x g for 5 min and supernatant (biocrust soil water) was pipetted and placed in new 2 ml tubes. Remaining biocrust was stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until nucleic acid extraction was performed. There were 5 biological replicates, 5 time points and 4 successional stages of biocrust resulting in 100 total samples. An extraction control (3 replicates of water, no soil) was included and sampled at 49.5 h to evaluate background contamination. To control for abiotic metabolite processes (such as sorption, photodegradation, etc), a separate experiment was performed where soil water was sampled along the same time points (5 sampling time points in triplicate) from killed (autoclaved 4 times) biocrust from a late successional stage.\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Strauss SL, Day TA, Garcia-Pichel F.

Note that this same analysis could be done with other open-source software packages. Authentic standards were then used to validate assignments based on 2 orthogonal data (accurate mass less than 15 p.p.m., retention time within 1 min and/or MS/MS matching major fragments) relative to standards and/or the Metlin database[2][3] and are provided in Supplementary Data 1 in the paper associated with this study. Metabolites that did not match orthogonal measures were classified as putative and are indicated by parentheses in figures. Internal standards were assessed from each sample to ensure peak area and retention times were consistent from sample-to-sample. Quality control mixtures were included at the beginning, end and throughout the runs to ensure proper instrument performance (m/z accuracy and retention time and peak area stability). Sample QC failed (internal standards were not present within the specified retention time window) for some replicates including all 9 h wetup level D samples and were not included for further analyses.\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Yao Y, Sun T, Wang T, Ruebel O, Northen T, Bowen BP.
