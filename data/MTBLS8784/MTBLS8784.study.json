                "description": "<p>Beyond motor neuron degeneration, homozygous mutations in the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene cause multiorgan and metabolic defects in patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). However, the precise biochemical features of these alterations and the age of onset in the brain and peripheral organs remain unclear. Using untargeted NMR-based metabolomics in SMA mice, we identify cerebral and hepatic abnormalities related to energy homeostasis pathways and amino acid metabolism, emerging already at postnatal day 3 (P3) in the liver. Through HPLC, we find that SMN deficiency induces a drop in cerebral norepinephrine levels in overt symptomatic SMA mice at P11, affecting the mRNA and protein expression of key genes regulating monoamine metabolism, including aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC), dopamine beta-hydroxylase (D\u03b2H) and monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A). In support of the translational value of our preclinical observations, we also discovered that SMN upregulation increases cerebrospinal fluid norepinephrine concentration in Nusinersen-treated SMA1 patients. Our findings highlight a previously unrecognized harmful influence of low SMN levels on the expression of critical enzymes involved in monoamine metabolism, suggesting that SMN-inducing therapies may modulate catecholamine neurotransmission. These results may also be relevant for setting therapeutic approaches to counteract peripheral metabolic defects in SMA. </p>",

Specifically, qualitative research of metabolites was carried out using Chenomx NMR-Suite v8.0 (Chenomx Inc., Edmonton, Canada), which permits the identification of metabolites supported by the combination of advanced analysis tools with compound libraries. In particular, the analysis of spectra liver at P3 and P11 detected 44 and 51 metabolites, respectively; moreover, the analysis of brain spectra identified 22 metabolites at both times. Subsequently, quantitative analysis was performed using NMRProcFlow[<strong>1]</strong>, which allows multiple processing on 1D NMR spectra like baseline correction, ppm calibration, spectral alignment, solvent suppression and normalization by probabilistic quotient. For the quantification, we chose ppm ranges for each metabolite peak located in uncrowded areas of the spectrum to avoid contamination by adjacent ones. All the data needed for the quantification were exported into a spreadsheet workbook using the 'qHNMR' template, which collects information within 5 separate tabs: sample table, bucket table, signal-to-noise ratio matrix, and values of integration for each bucket (columns), and each spectrum (rows). The workbook includes sample volume (mL), the weight of brain or livers, the number of protons related to the metabolites' peaks and the molecular weight of the metabolites, which are necessary for correct quantification. The data matrix generated by NMR ProcFlow was finally used for statistical analysis.</p><p><br></p><p>For CSF human samples, resonance assignment was carried out using Bayesil online server<strong>[2]</strong> by uploading the 1D-1H NOESY NMR spectra obtained from the CSF polar extracts of SMA1 patients. The software detected the presence of 35 metabolites and quantified them using as an internal standard the given concentration of TSP-d<strong>[3]</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p>NMR metabolomic data were analyzed by multivariate analysis (MVA). The One-Class Support Vector Machine (SVM) analysis has been conducted in order to identify the presence of outliers<strong>[4]</strong>. SVM data showed the absence of outliers. Matrices, including metabolites and their concentrations as derived from 1H-NMR data collected in 1D NOESY<strong>[5]</strong> were normalized by sum and using the Pareto scaling approach. The matrices were analyzed using a univariate approach combining t-test and fold-change through the Volcano plot. After normalization, data matrices were analyzed by principal component analysis (PCA), which reduces a dataset onto a lower-dimensional feature subspace while maintaining most of the relevant information, and PLS-DA, which reduces dimensionality while maximizing between-class separation, using MetaboAnalyst 5.0 (http://www.metaboanalyst.ca)<strong>[6]-[8]</strong>. The performance of the PCA and PLS-DA model was evaluated using the coefficient Q2 (using the 7-fold internal cross-validation method) and the coefficient R2, defining the variance predicted and explained by the model. The loading plots were used to identify the metabolites responsible for maximum separation in the PLS-DA score plot, and these metabolites were ranked according to their VIP scores, indicating the variables\u2019 importance<strong>[9]</strong>. To provide an intuitive visualization of data tables we performed heatmaps using normalized data, average groups concentration and Euclidian distance<strong>[10]</strong>. The analysis of the pathways was carried out by analyzing the Enrichment tool. The output of Metaboanalyst was examined and the chosen KEGG paths according to the lower FDR, p-value\u2009&lt;\u20090.05 and the hit values related to the number of metabolites belonging to the pathway &gt; 1.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Jacob D, Deborde C, Lefebvre M, Maucourt M, Moing A.
