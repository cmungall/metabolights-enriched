                "description": "<p>Chassis strain suitable for producing multiple compounds is a central concept in synthetic biology. Design of a chassis using computational, first-principle, models is particularly attractive due to the predictability and control it offers, including against phenotype reversal due to adaptive mutations. Yet, the theory of model-based chassis design has rarely been put to rigorous experimental test and assessed at multiomics level. Here, we report two <em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</em> chassis strains for dicarboxylic acid production based on genome-scale metabolic modelling. The chassis strain, harbouring gene knockouts in serine biosynthesis and in pentose-phosphate pathway, is geared for higher flux towards three target products - succinate, fumarate and malate - but does not appreciably secrete any. Introducing modular product-specific mutations resulted in improved secretion of the corresponding acid as predicted by the model. Adaptive laboratory evolution of the chassis-derived producer cells further improved production for succinate and fumarate attesting to the evolutionary robustness of the underlying growth-product coupling. In the case of malate, which exhibited decreased production during evolution, the multiomics analysis revealed flux bypass at peroxisomal malate dehydrogenase that was not accounted in the model. Integration of transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics data showed overall concordance with the flux re-routing predicted by the model. Together, our results provide experimental evidence for model-based design of microbial chassis and have implications for computer-aided design of microbial cell factories.</p>",

Parental strain, CEN.PK119 (URA3/ura3-52), was derived from crossing strains CEN.PK113-5D and CEN.PK113-1A by zygote isolation using a SINGER micromanipulator. Deletion cassettes were obtained by the short flanking homology method<strong>[2] </strong>using pUG6, pUG74 or pUG75 as template<strong>[3]</strong> and with the primers listed in <strong>Table S8 </strong>in the paper associated with this study. Yeast strains were transformed as described<strong>[4]</strong>. Transformants were selected on solid YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose, 1.5% agar; Formedium) supplemented with 200 mg/L G418 (Formedium), 100 mg/L nourseothricin (clonNat, Werner BioAgents) or 300 mg/L hygromycin B (Formedium). Single mutants were constructed by transforming the corresponding deletion cassette in the diploid strain CEN.PK119 (URA3/ura3-52). After tetrad analysis segregants of both mating types for URA3 and ura3-52 were isolated. Gene deletions of transformants 10 and after tetrad analysis of haploid segregants were confirmed by diagnostic PCR using the primers listed in <strong>Table S8 </strong>in the paper associated with this study. Yeast strains with multiple deletions were generated by crossing, starting with the single deletion strains. The mating types of the strains constructed in this study were determined by PCR using whole yeast cells<strong>[5]</strong>. Plasmid containing deltagdh1:GDH2_URA3MX4 cassette was assembled using TheYeastPathwayKit method<strong>[6]</strong>. The strains were grown to stationary phase at 30 \u00b0C and 180 rpm agitation in shake flask cultures on YPD medium (10 g/L 15 of yeast extract, 20 g/L of peptone, and 20 g/L of glucose). Stock cultures were prepared by adding glycerol to the culture broth (final concentration 30% v/v) and stored in sterile vials at -80 \u00b0C. For YPD plates, 20 g/L of agar was included in the medium formulation. Pre-cultures were inoculated from a single colony of plated frozen stocks.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Media and yeast cultivation</strong></p><p>Yeast cells were grown in defined minimal medium<strong>[7]</strong> (MD) with 20 g/L of glucose (MD20), as carbon source, pH 5 on an orbital shaker set to 180 rpm at 30 \u00b0C, unless indicated otherwise. Glycine auxotrophic strains were grown in the same medium supplemented with 500 mg/L of glycine, added by sterile filtration. Pre-cultures were prepared by cultivating a 25 single colony from a selective YPD plate of each yeast strain in YPD medium until mid-exponential phase (~16 h). Pre-cultured cells were centrifuged, washed 2 times with distilled water, re-suspended in MD and used for inoculation in MD with initial OD600 of 0.1. These cultivations were performed in triplicates. Growth and multi-omics strain characterization was performed in MD20 with the procedure described above. Whereas adaptive laboratory evolution was performed in MD media with high glucose concentration (100 g/L 30 - MD100) in 50 mL shake-flasks with 13 mL of MD100 medium at 30 \u00b0C and constant agitation of 180 rpm.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Adaptive laboratory evolution</strong></p><p><strong>Chassis_z</strong> and chassis-derived producing strains (<strong>Producer_F</strong>, <strong>Producer_Fz</strong>, <strong>Producer_Sz</strong>, <strong>Producer_Mz</strong> and<strong> Producer_FzG</strong>) were used in the adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) experiments. ALE was performed by serial transfers of yeast cultures into fresh 35 MD100 medium. 3 independent parallel evolution cultures of each selected design were performed in shake flasks. Each independent culture was inoculated at an initial OD of 0.15 in fresh medium along the evolution experiment. ALE experiment was conducted for 100 d, corresponding to an average of 24 serial passages. The first 4 consecutive passages were performed in medium supplemented with glycine, which was abruptly removed after the 4th passage. Thereafter, ALE was completed in MD100 without any amino acid supplementation. Culture stocks were 5 frozen and stored at regular intervals throughout the process. The final evolved populations were plated in MD20+ agar. 3 isolated colonies of each independent parallel population were picked for further physiological characterization, regarding their specific growth rate and production profile. All isolated clones from one of the parallel evolutions of <strong>Producer_F </strong>and <strong>Producer_Mz</strong>, had high growth rates and lower lag-phases (<strong>Fig. S4 </strong>in the paper associated with this study), comparable to <strong>wild-type </strong>strain. However, these isolates were no longer able to produce the respective target compound. The loss of production and improved fitness was not further investigated, neither the genotype of the isolates confirmed to rule out possible contaminations. The graphical pipeline of directed evolution followed by screening and the selection of the best growth-coupled producers employed in this study are depicted in <strong>Fig. 2 </strong>and <strong>Fig. S3 </strong> in the paper associated with this study.</p><p><br></p><p>For targeted extracelular metabolomics, samples were taken at 5 precise times. After centrifugation (4,000 x g, 10 min), 5 mL supernatants were filtered using 0.2 \u03bcm PVDF (Poly(vinylidene fluoride)) syringe filter (Phenomenex, USA) and stored at -20 \u00b0C until High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and Gas Chromatography - Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis was performed. Organic acids, including succinic acid, malic acid, fumaric acid, pyruvic acid and lactic acid were determined by GC-MS.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs: </strong></p><p><strong>[1] </strong>Entian, K.
