                "description": "<p>Buyang Huanwu decoction (BHD) is a well-known Chinese herbal prescription. It has been widely used in the clinical treatment of cerebral ischemia (CI) in China. However, the mechanism underlying the treatment of CI with BHD remains to be elucidated. In this study, we combined microbiomic and metabolomic strategies to explore the therapeutic effects of BHD on middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in rats. Our results showed that BHD could effectively improve neurological severity scores and alleviate neuronal damage in rats with MCAO. BHD could also reduce the level of peripheral proinflammatory cytokines and inhibit neuroinflammation. 16S rRNA sequencing showed that BHD could increase the relative abundances of the genera Lactobacillus, Faecalibacterium, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-002, etc., while decreasing the relative abundances of the genera Escherichia-Shigella, Klebsiella, Streptococcus, Coprococcus_2, Enterococcus, etc. Untargeted metabolomic analysis of hippocampal samples showed that 17 significantly differentially abundant metabolites and 9 enriched metabolic pathways were linked with BHD treatment. We also found that the regulatory effects of BHD on metabolites were correlated with the differentially abundant microbial taxa. The predicted function of the gut microbiota and the metabolic pathway enrichment results showed that purine metabolism, glutamatergic synapses, arginine and proline metabolism, and alanine, aspartic acid and glutamate metabolism were involved in the effects of BHD. These pathways may be related to pathological processes such as excitotoxicity, neuroinflammation, and energy metabolism disorder in CI. In summary, these findings suggest that regulation of hippocampal metabolism and of the composition and function of the gut microbiota may be important mechanisms underlying the effect of BHD in the treatment of CI.</p>",

Main parameters of 5 ppm precursor tolerance, 10 ppm product tolerance, and 5% product ion threshold were applied. Compound identification were based on precise mass-to-charge ratio (M/z), secondary fragments, and isotopic distribution using <strong>The Human Metabolome Database (HMDB)</strong>, <strong>Lipidmaps (V2.3)</strong>, <strong>Metlin</strong>, <strong>EMDB</strong>, <strong>PMDB</strong>, and self-built databases to do qualitative analysis. The extracted data were then further processed by removing any peaks with a missing value (ion intensity = 0) in more than 50% in groups, by replacing zero value by half of the minimum value, and by screening according to the qualitative results of the compound. Compounds with resulting scores below 36 (out of 60) points were also deemed to be inaccurate and removed. A data matrix was combined from the positive and negative ion data.</p>",
