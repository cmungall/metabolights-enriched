                "description": "<p>The pathogenic mechanisms of many diseases are well understood at the molecular level, but there are prevalent diseases associated with pathogenic signaling, such as diabetes and chronic inflammatory disorders, where our understanding is more limited. Here we report that pathogenic signaling suppresses the mobility of a spectrum of proteins that play essential roles in cellular functions known to be dysregulated in these chronic diseases. This behavior was linked to cysteine residues in the affected proteins and signaling-related increases in excess reactive oxygen species. Diverse pathogenic stimuli, including hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia and inflammation, produce similar suppressed protein mobility phenotypes. We propose that suppressed protein mobility may account for various pathogenic features of diverse chronic diseases.</p>",

Cells were seeded at a density of 32,000 cells/cm^2 onto 35-mm glass bottom dishes (MatTek Corporation, P35G-1.5-20-C). Starting the day after plating, cells were serum-starved for 2 days by washing the plates twice with EMEM media without FBS (EMEM) and maintaining the cells in EMEM for 48 h. Then cells were treated with EMEM supplemented with 0.125% fatty acid-free BSA (Sigma Aldrich, I9278-5ML) ('EMEM-BSA') that contained either 1) 0.1 nM insulin (Sigma Aldrich, I9278-5ML) or 2) 3 nM insulin, which are the concentrations of insulin in the portal vein of healthy and insulin resistant patients. The media was changed twice per day (every ~12 h) for 3 days. This treatment regime produced either a baseline 'healthy' signaling state or a 'pathologic' elevated signaling state[1]. To ensure that the protein mobility was due to the cellular state and not due to differences in the concentration of insulin, insulin was washed out by extensively washing cells with EMEM. The cells were washed 6x times with 2 mL of EMEM, including 3x quick washes, 2x 5 min washes and a 15 min wash at 37 \u00b0C. Cells were then acutely treated with 3 nM insulin for 5 min in EMEM-BSA at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator and then subjected to the desired assay.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>H2O2 treatment</strong></p><p>Cells were seeded at a density of 32,000 cells/cm^2, serum-starved for 2 days as described above.

Following a quick wash in EMEM, cells were treated with 0, 2, 4, 10, 15 or 20 mM H2O2 (Sigma Aldrich, H1009) in EMEM for 5 min at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2 incubator.

The PBS was then removed and 500 \u03bcL of ice-cold 80% methanol, 20% water solution with isotope-labeled amino acid mass-spec internal standards (provided by the Whitehead Institute Metabolomics Core) was added to each well on dry ice. The plate was chilled at -80 \u00b0C for a minimum of 15 min, then the cells were scraped for 30 s with a plastic cell scraper (Corning, 3008). The methanol-cell mixture was transferred to a 1.5 mL eppendorf tube (Eppendorf, 0223641). The well was washed again with 300 \u03bcL of the ice-cold methanol solution to extract all remaining cells from the well, which was added to the same 1.5 mL eppendorf tube. The mixture was vortexed on high for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C, then centrifuged on a table top centrifuge on max speed for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C. Next 600 \u03bcL of supernatant were removed from the tube and transferred to a fresh tube on dry ice. The supernatant was dried for 5 h at 4 \u00b0C using a speed vac (Labconco 7310020), then resuspended in 1/10th of the volume of the original supernatant in LC-MS grade water (provided by the Whitehead Institute Metabolomics Core) on ice. The resuspended metabolites were vortexed on high for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C, then centrifuged on a table top centrifuge on max speed for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C. The supernatant containing the endogenous metabolites and internal standards were transferred to LC-MS vials and liquid chromatography and mass spec was carried out by the Whitehead Institute Metabolomics Core.</p>",

                        "description": "<p>FreeStyle (Thermo Scientific, Version 1.3 ) was used to check quality, mass shift and retention time drift for each metabolite. The MS2 spectra for each metabolite was also verified in FreeStyle. TraceFinder (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Version 4.1) was used to call metabolite peaks and determine raw peak areas. The peak detection defaults were as follows - Mass tolerance: 5 ppm, Retention time window: 30 s, Ion Ratio Window type: relative +/- 20%, Ion coelution 0.100 min, Detection algorithm: ICIS (Area noise factor: 5, Peak noise factor: 10, Baseline window: 40, Noise method: repetitive, Min peak width: 3, Multiplet resolution: 10, Area tail extension: 5). Each peak was manually verified to have the correct shape, retention time and m/z.</p><p><br></p><p>Peak area ratios were determined by normalizing the raw peak area for each metabolite by the raw peak area of the appropriate internal standard.</p><p><br></p><p>During the mass spec run, a pooled sample made from pooling 5 \u03bcL of each sample was run 4-6x times as technical replicates to measure the reliability of detection for each metabolite - a coefficient of variation &lt; 0.30 was used as a cutoff for metabolites to be measured reliably. Similarly, a dilution series of the pool was also run to determine whether each metabolite was in the linear range of detection - a correlation coefficient R &lt; 0.95 was used as a cutoff.</p><p><br></p><p>Two-tailed student's t-test was used to generate p-values. Statistical analysis was performed using Prism Version 9.4.0 (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA).</p>",
