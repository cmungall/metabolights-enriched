                "description": "Glandular trichomes are metabolic cell factories with the capacity to produce large quantities of secondary metabolites. Little is known about the connection between central carbon metabolism and metabolic productivity for secondary metabolites in glandular trichomes. To address this gap in our knowledge, we performed comparative metabolomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and 13C-labeling of type VI glandular trichomes and leaves from a cultivated (Solanum lycopersicum LA4024) and a wild (Solanum habrochaites LA1777) tomato accession. Specific features of glandular trichomes that drive the formation of secondary metabolites could be identified. Tomato type VI trichomes are photosynthetic but acquire their carbon essentially from leaf sucrose. The energy and reducing power from photosynthesis are used to support the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, while the comparatively reduced Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle activity may be involved in recycling metabolic CO2. Glandular trichomes cope with oxidative stress by producing high levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids, oxylipins, and glutathione. Finally, distinct mechanisms are present in glandular trichomes to increase the supply of precursors for the isoprenoid pathways. Particularly, the citrate-malate shuttle supplies cytosolic acetyl CoA and plastidic glycolysis and malic enzyme support the formation of plastidic pyruvate. A model is proposed on how glandular trichomes achieve high metabolic productivity.",

For trichome harvest, tomato leaves were put on the hand palm (using gloves) and trichomes were quickly brushed off the leaves by a 2 cm broad paint brush which was dipped in liquid nitrogen. Trichomes of 15 plant leaves (LA1777) and 50 plant leaves (LA4024), respectively, were pooled in a mortar filled likewise with liquid nitrogen. The quenched trichomes were further purified under liquid nitrogen conditions by sieving through steel sieves of 150 \u00b5m mesh width (Retsch, Haan, Germany). Trichome-free leaves were gently ground in a mortar likewise filled with liquid nitrogen. After removal of all liquid nitrogen during storage at -80 \u00b0C, leaves and trichomes were lyophilized over night and stored in a deep freezer until use.",

During the latter, the transmission range for precursor ions in the Q1-quadrupol is set for 20 ms to mass windows of 33 Dalton and is incremented from m/z = 65-1250.  Simultaneously, CID-fragmentation is acquired in relation to each SWATH transmission window. Thus, compromising between Q1 dwell times and MS2 spectra purity, LC-SWATH-MS/MS measurements allow for rapid assessment of MS1 and MS2 spectra with cycle times below 1/s.\n</p>\nTargeted ion detection for hydrophilic metabolites by scheduled multiple reaction monitoring was applied using a Sciex 6500 QTRAP  and the software Analyst 1.7 (Sciex, Toronto, Canada).
