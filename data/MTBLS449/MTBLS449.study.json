                "description": "Increased morbidity and fetal growth restriction are reported in uninfected children born to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)\u2013infected women treated with antiretroviral (ARV) therapy. Viruses and/or pharmacological interventions such as ARVs can induce metabolic stress, skewing the cell\u2019s immune response and restricting (cell) growth. Novel metabolomic techniques provided the opportunity to investigate the impact of fetal HIV-1 and combination ARV therapy (cART) exposure on the infants\u2019 immune metabolome. Peroxidized lipids, generated by reactive oxygen species, were increased in cART/HIV-1\u2013exposed infants, indicating altered mitochondrial functioning. The lipid metabolism was further dysregulated with increased triglyceride species and a subsequent decrease in phospholipids in cART/HIV-1\u2013exposed infants compared to control infants. Proinflammatory immune mediators, lysophospholipids as well as cytokines such as CXCL10 and CCL3, were increased whereas anti-inflammatory metabolites from the cytochrome P450 pathway were reduced in cART/HIV-1\u2013exposed infants. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the fetal metabolism is impacted by maternal factors (cART and HIV-1) and skews physiological immune responses toward inflammation in the newborn infant.",

The samples were collected at the Academic Medical Center (Amsterdam, the Netherlands). The study was approved by the local ethics committee and informed consent was obtained from participating mothers. For the cART/HIV-1-exposed group, maternal viral load, CD4+ T cell count, total triglyceride, total cholesterol and antiretroviral medications were obtained from the patient hospital records (Table S1 in the paper associated with this study). Total triglyceride and total cholesterol levels where not available for the control group. The cART regimen that was used for each patient (Table S1) was based on viral resistance or the patient\u2019s treatment regimen prior to conception. Per European guidelines, the cART regimen consisted of two NRTI\u2019s (primarily zidovudine and lamivudine) and either a protease inhibitor (ritonavir-boosted lopinavir or nelfinavir) or an NNRTI (nevirapine). 5 of the 12 women were receiving cART treatment prior to pregnancy. 1 patient took tenofovir during the first trimester of pregnancy combined with lamivudine and nevirapine, while another received nevirapine (NNRTI), in combination with ritonavir boosted lopinavir and saquinavir due to her resistance profile. During birth, all HIV-1-infected mothers were given intrapartum zidovudine. The clinical profile at delivery of the 12 mothers in the study indicates that the virus was suppressed appropriately, consistent with a mother-to-child transmission rate of <1%. HIV-1 infection was evaluated at birth, 5 weeks and 3 months by measuring RNA viral load with PCR and confirmed at 18 months of age, by showing absence of detectable HIV immunoglobulin G. All infants were confirmed to be HIV-1\u2013negative.\n</p>\nPlasma was separated by centrifugation at 5000 x g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C and stored at \u201320 \u00b0C prior to analysis and transported to the Biomedical Facility Leiden (Leiden University) for metabolomics analysis.",

In short, 1000 \u00b5l IPA containing calibrant and internal standards both at C4 levels were added to 10 \u00b5l serum to precipitate proteins. After centrifugation (12.100 rpm, 10 mins, at RT) supernatant containing the lipids is transferred to vials for LC-MS analysis.

Briefly, 440 \u00b5l methanol containing internal standard is added to 20 \u00b5l serum. After centrifugation, the protein is precipitated and the lipid containing supernatant is transferred to clean Eppendorf tubes and the solvent is evaporated using a Speedvac. The dried lipids were reconstituted in 145 \u00b5l IPA, 0.1% formic acid and transferred to autosampler vials. In total 8 \u00b5l was injected for analysis.\n</p>\nOxylipin profiling:</br>\nAntioxidant mixture (5 \u00b5l) (0.4 mg/ml BHT and 0.4 mg/ml EDTA mixed with volume ratio 1:1) and a mixture of internal-standard mixtures (ISTDs) (5 \u00b5l, 1000nM) were added into each 150 \u00b5l aliquot of cordblood plasma. Subsequently the samples were loaded on the activated SPE plates (Oasis-HLB 96-well plates, 60mg, 30\u00b5m) and eluted using ethyl acetate (1.5ml). The dried eluate was re-dissolved in 50 \u00b5l acetonitrile/methanol (50:50 v/v) and 5 \u00b5l were used for HPLC analysis.\n</p>\nQuality Control Samples:</br>\nQuality control (QC) samples were used during the metabolomics analyses. Equal volumes of each study sample were pooled to generate a QC pool. A set of QC samples was then included in the analyses with the experimental groups on the individual metabolomics platforms, and the QC samples were distributed randomly through the samples prior to liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis. In addition, independent duplicate samples were randomly selected. Only those metabolites for which the duplicate and QC samples had a relative standard deviation <30% were considered to be measured accurately.",

First, we evaluated for outlier samples based on a 95% confidence region in a Hotelling\u2019s T-squared distribution test. No outlier samples were identified in all the platforms measured. Significant metabolites were identified based on the following 2 criteria: (1) a fold change (FC) =1.25 or =0.75, indicating a 25% increase or decrease, respectively, and (2) a p-value <0.05 using the Mann-Whitney U test. The significant univariate results are shown on a volcano plot as coloured symbols. Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficients were generated using log-transformed normalized data in SPSS. During the correlation analyses, each metabolite was tested against 8 immunological markers, and no multiple testing correction was performed, as only class responses\u2014and not individual correlations\u2014were interpreted. Significant correlations were defined as a Pearson\u2019s coefficient (r) >0.46 or r <-0.46 and p<0.05.",
