                "description": "<p>Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (UPHLC-HRMS) is used to discover and monitor single or sets of biomarkers informing about metabolic processes of interest. The technique can detect thousands of molecules (i.e., metabolites) in a single instrument run and provide a measurement of the global metabolome, which could be a fingerprint of activity. Despite the power of this approach, technical challenges have hindered the effective use of metabolomics to interrogate microbial communities implicated in the removal of priority contaminants. Herein, our efforts to circumvent these challenges and apply this emerging systems biology technique to synthetic microbiomes relevant for contaminant biodegradation will be discussed. Chlorinated ethenes impact many contaminated sites, and detoxification can be achieved by organohalide-respiring bacteria, a process currently assessed by quantitative gene-centric tools (e.g., quantitative PCR). </p><p><br></p><p>This laboratory study monitored the metabolome of the SDC-9 bioaugmentation consortium during cis-1,2-dichloroethene conversion to vinyl chloride and nontoxic ethene. Untargeted metabolomics using an UPLC-Orbitrap mass spectrometer and performed on SDC-9 cultures at different stages of the reductive dechlorination process detected ~10,000 spectral features per sample arising from water-soluble molecules with both known and unknown structures. Multivariate statistical techniques including partial least squares-discriminate analysis (PLS-DA) identified patterns of measurable spectral features (peak patterns) that correlated with dechlorination (in)activity. ANOVA analyses identified 18 potential biomarkers of reductive dechlorination activity. Statistical clustering of samples with these 18 features predicted dechlorination activity more reliably than clustering of samples based only on chlorinated ethene concentration and Dhc 16S rRNA gene abundance data, highlighting the value of metabolomic workflows as an innovative site assessment and bioremediation monitoring tool.</p>",

Glass serum bottles (160 mL) containing 100 mL of bicarbonate-buffered defined mineral salt medium<strong>[1]</strong> were sealed with rubber stoppers and autoclaved. Once cooled, filter-sterilized vitamin mix<strong>[2]</strong> excluding vitamin B12, and lactate (10 mM) was added to the medium, and 50 \u03bcg/L vitamin B12 was added. Cultures were then inoculated (5% v/v) directly from the stock culture suspension inside an anoxic chamber filled hydrogen (3% v/v) and nitrogen (97% v/v). The electron acceptor, cDCE (6 \u03bcL, 79.2 \u03bcmol) or VC gas (2 mL, 83.3 \u03bcmol) was added. Control cultures received no electron acceptor. All cultures were incubated at room temperature (22 \u00b0C) in the dark under static conditions. Entire cultures were sacrificed before initiation of dechlorination (100% cDCE/VC remaining, t0), at the beginning of dechlorination (&gt;90% cDCE/VC remaining, t1), during active dechlorination (20-80% cDCE/VC remaining, t2-3), and for up to 14 days after dechlorination was completed (0% cDCE/VC remaining, t5-7).

Filters were then place upside down in a Petri dish (47 mm) containing 1.3 mL of chilled (-20 \u00b0C) extraction solvent (40:40:20 acetonitrile:methanol:water with 0.1M formic acid). Extraction was continued for 15-20 min at -20 \u00b0C at which point the filter was flipped right side up and washed. The extraction solvent was transferred to a 2 mL microcentrifuge tube. The filter was then washed with 200 \u03bcL chilled (-20 \u00b0C) extraction solvent and added to the microcentrifuge tube and the combined extracts were centrifuged (5 min, 13.2 rpm, 4 \u00b0C). The supernatant was removed and transferred to clean vial. The pellet was then extracted with 200 \u03bcL of extraction solvent (chilled to -20 \u00b0C) for 15 minutes at -20 \u00b0C, after which the samples were once again centrifuged (5 min, 13.2 rpm, 4 \u00b0C). The supernatants were removed and combined with the previously collected supernatant, and the extraction process was repeated once more.

The nitrogen sheath gas was set to 10 psi, with a capillary temperature of 320 \u00b0C and AGC target was set to 3e^6. Samples were analyzed with a resolution of 140,000. A scan window of 85-800 m/z (mass-to-charge) was used from 0.0 to 9.0 min and a window of 110-1000 m/z from 9.0 to 25.0 min.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Lu W, Clasquin MF, Melamud E, Amador-Noguez D, Caudy AA, Rabinowitz JD.

Feature detection and removal from instrument blank was also utilized for optimal feature detection. Detected features were then trimmed using a % coefficient of variation (%CV) of less than 40% for pooled samples. Remaining features were normalized using TBAC 16S qPCR cell count data and the cell normalized ion intensities were used in all following analyses. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Chambers MC, Maclean B, Burke R, Amodei D, Ruderman DL, Neumann S, Gatto L, Fischer B, Pratt B, Egertson J, Hoff K, Kessner D, Tasman N, Shulman N, Frewen B, Baker TA, Brusniak MY, Paulse C, Creasy D, Flashner L, Kani K, Moulding C, Seymour SL, Nuwaysir LM, Lefebvre B, Kuhlmann F, Roark J, Rainer P, Detlev S, Hemenway T, Huhmer A, Langridge J, Connolly B, Chadick T, Holly K, Eckels J, Deutsch EW, Moritz RL, Katz JE, Agus DB, MacCoss M, Tabb DL, Mallick P.
