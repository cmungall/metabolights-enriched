                "description": "<p>With the rapid development of 5G networks, the influence of the radiofrequency field (RF) generated from 5G communication equipment on human health are gathering increasing attention. This study aimed at assessing the effects of long-term exposure to 4.9 GHz (one of the working frequency of 5G communication) RF field on fecal microbiome and metabolome profiles in 9-week-old male C57BL/6 mice. The animals were divided into sham group (n = 8) and radiofrequency group (RF group; n = 8), then whole body exposed or sham exposed to RF field for one hour per day during 3 weeks (21 days) at whole body Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) of 6.3 W/kg. After RF exposure, the mice fecal samples were collected to detect gut microorganisms and metabolites by 16S rRNA gene sequencing method and LC-MS method, respectively. The results showed that intestinal microbial compositions were altered in RF group, as evidenced by reduced microbial diversity and changed microbial community distribution. Metabolomics profiling identified 258 significantly differentially abundant metabolites in RF group, 57 of which can be classified to Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways. Besides, functional correlation analysis showed that changes in gut microbiota genera were significantly correlated with changes in fecal metabolites. In summary, the results suggested that altered gut microbiota and metabolic profile are associated with 4.9 GHz radiofrequency exposure.</p>",

Mice were randomly divided into Sham group and RF group. For the RF group, the mice with conscious were first placed in the plexiglass boxes. The size of each box was 32 x 42 x 80 mm with small ventilation holes on every side, and the mice were unable to move freely in the box. Then, the boxes with animals (an animal in a box) were laid out right next to each other during exposure. The animals were whole body exposed to 4.9 GHz RF field for 21 consecutive days (1 h/day). During exposure, the mice were awake, but not allowed to access food and water. The average power density (PD) was 50 \u00b1 2.5 W/m^2, which measured in advance by an electromagnetic field meter (PMM8053A, PMM Costruzioni Electtroniche Centro Misure Radio Electriche S.r.l., Milan, Italy). For the Sham group, the animals were processed in the same condition as the RF group, except the exposure control system kept closed. Fecal samples (4-6 grains) were collected after the last exposure and placed directly on ice and subsequently stored at -80 \u00b0C for metabolomic analyses. Metabolome profiling was conducted on UHPLC-Q Exactive HF-X platform (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) at Majorbio Bio-Pharm Technology Co., Ltd.

At the same time, variables with relative standard deviation (RSD) &gt; 30% of QC samples were removed, and log10 logarithmization was performed to obtain the final data matrix for subsequent analysis.</p><p><br></p><p>For metabolomic analysis, Student\u2019s t-test was used to compare metabolite profiles and differences between two groups visualized by Volcano plot. In order to explain the physical and chemical properties and biological functions of metabolites, the online <strong>KEGG</strong> (<strong>Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes</strong>; <a href='https://www.genome.jp/kegg' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>https://www.genome.jp/kegg</a>) databases was used to perform level-one and level-two identification and annotation. The importance of each metabolite was ranked according to their projection (VIP) scores calculated from the OPLS-DA model.</p><p><br></p><p>In total, 1155 metabolites were identified, including positive ion mode and negative ion mode for 504 and 651, respectively, 174 and 201 of which were annotated to <strong>KEGG</strong>. We also investigated the difference in fecal metabolites of mice that result from long-term exposure to 4.9 GHz radiofrequency field. The volcano plot revealed that 141 metabolites were downregulated while 117 genes were upregulated RF group.</p>",
