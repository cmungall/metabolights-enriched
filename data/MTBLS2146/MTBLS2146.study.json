                "description": "<p>SCFAs are the main microbial fermentation products from dietary fibers in colon and play a key role in keeping healthy in the whole-body. However, differences of SCFAs concentration in the serum and colon samples collected from rats had attracted few attentions. Here, we optimized the extract and analysis methods for quantification of ten SCFAs in both serum and colon content samples. Methanol and acetonitrile were chosen for extraction of SCFAs from serum and colon content samples, respectively. Biological samples collected from Alzheimer's disease rats treated by extract of <em>Schisandra chinensis</em> (Turcz.) Baill (SC-extract) were taken as research objects. The results showed that, the relative peak intensities of SCFAs in colon content from all groups were quite similar, and the trend was identical in serum samples. Compared with the values in human, the ratio of ten SCFAs in rat's colon was similar, while the percent of acetate in rat's serum was significantly higher. For therapy of AD, SC-extract decreased the concentration of butyrate, 3-Methyvalerate and caproate in serum samples towards the trend of normal rats. The present study may help to understand the transport of SCFAs across colonic epithelium in healthy and diseased organisms.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Method validation</strong> is reported in the current study <strong>MTBLS2146</strong></p><p><strong>SCFA serum and colon content determination</strong> is reported in study <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/editor/study/MTBLS2088/' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS2088</strong></a></p>",

Chromatographic separation was performed on a Waters Acquity BEH C18 column (2.1 x 50 mm, 1.7 m). The mobile phases were composed of 0.01% formic acid in water (v/v) (A) and 0.01% formic acid in acetonitrile (v/v) (B).The mobile phases were eluted at 0.30 ml/min with the gradient as follows: 0\u20133 min 15% B; 3\u201311 min 15-45% B; 11\u201312 min 55-99.9% B; 12\u201312.1 min 99.9-15% B; re-equilibrate at 15% B for 2 min. The column temperature was maintained at 40\u00b0C, and the injection volume was 5 \u03bcl.</p><p><br></p><p>Quality control (QC) samples from serum samples and colon contents were prepared from each biological sample to ensure broad metabolite coverage. Calibration standard solutions were prepared according to the peak areas of derivatived SCFAs in QC samples. For colon content samples, the QC samples were prepared by the mixed working solutions with 2-Methybutyrate, Valerate and Caproate 3.9, 500, and 1000 nM, and other SCFAs 3.9, 1000, and 2000 nM as LQC (low-concentration quality control), MQC (medium-concentration quality control), and HQC (high-concentration quality control). For serum samples, the QC samples were prepared by the mixed working solutions with Acetate 4.88, 78.125, and 625 nM, and other SCFAs 0.0049, 0.19, and 12.5 nM as LQC, MQC, and HQC.</p><p><br></p><p>50 \u03bcl of QC sample was spiked with 50 \u03bcl of Mixed standard working solutions at high, medium, and low analytic concentrations respectively (n = 9, each concentration was prepared in triplicate) with (A) and without (B) extraction followed by derivatization.

The matrix effect and the efficiency of the MRM method was shown with the chromatographic charts of representative sample, control solvent and blank solvent in <strong>Fig S3</strong> (colon content sample) and <strong>Fig S4</strong> (serum sample). The chromatographic peak area was integrated automatically. For colon content sample, the potential interfering agents included the peaks at 1.80 min, 3.00 min, and 7.38 min. The first 2 peaks could not be integrated. And the area of peak at 7.38 min in control solvent was just 0.53% of this peak in representative sample. For serum sample, the only potential interfering agent was the peaks at 1.80 min in the channel of acetate, and the area was 4.7% of this peak in representative sample. These data proved that the matrix effect was insignificant.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Jin YY, Shi ZQ, Chang WQ, Guo LX, Zhou JL, Liu JQ, Liu LF, Xin GZ.

The suspensions were centrifuged for 10 min at 15,493 x g and 4 \u00b0C. For serum samples, SCFAs were extracted by adding 200 ml methanol to 100 ml serum sample followed by a vortex for 1 min.

Briefly, 2 derivative reagents (2 ml) were prepared respectively. Reagent 1: constituted of 1 ml of 200mmol/l 3-NPH, 200 l of 600 mmol/l EDC, and 800 l 7.5% pyridine and prepared in 30% acetonitrile. Reagent 2: constituted of 1 ml of 100 mmol/l 3-NPH, 200 l of 300 mmol/l EDC, and 800 l 3.75% pyridine and prepared in 30% acetonitrile. The whole process was performed in an ice bath, and all reagents were fresh. The SCFAs extraction were mixed with derivative reagent at the ratio of 1:1 (v/v; 200 \u00b5l in total). Reagent 1 was used for colon content samples, and reagent 2 was used for serum samples. Afterwards, the mixture was permitted to react in a dry warm bath at 40 \u00b0C for 30 min. After reaction, the mixture was cooled down at 4 \u00b0C and finally diluted to 1 ml with 30% cooled acetonitrile.

                        "description": "<p>The MS/MS detection was performed on a XEVO TQ-S mass spectrometer (Waters Corp., Milford, MA) via electrospray ionization source in the negative mode (ESI-). The parameters of mass spectrometer included a capillary voltage of 2.7 kV; a cone energy of 27 V; a desolvation temperature of 350 \u00b0C; desolvation gas of 600 l/hr and cone gas of 150 l/hr.</p><p><br></p><p>Multiple Reaction Monitor (MRM) conditions acquisition modes were optimized in MsaaLynx V4.1 software for the determination of derivatived SCFAs according to the published reports<strong>[1][2]</strong> and summarized in <strong>Table S5</strong> in the paper associated with this study. All the peaks were integrated with a default peak-to peak amplitude and one time of smooth in a window size of \u00b1 2. The peak detect baselines were set as follows: join valleys if peaks resolved to 5.00% above baseline; reduce peak tailing until trailing edge is no more than 100.00% wider than leading edge; raise baseline by no more than 0.00% of peak height. The peak separation were limited by the parameters as follows: draw vertical if peaks resolved to 90% above baseline, detect shoulder peaks if slope is less than 70.00% of maximum. The response threshold were above 3.00% for relative area and 3000.00 for absolute area.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Wang HY, Wang C, Guo LX, Zheng YF, Hu WH, Dong TTX, Wang TJ, Tsim KWK.

All animals were housed under clean grade conditions at the laboratory animal centre of Shenzhen Institute for Drug Control (Shenzhen, China). The environment was maintained at 44-65% humidity and a 12-h light/dark cycle at 22-26 \u00b0C. All animal experiment protocols were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of Shenzhen Institute for Drug Control. For this study, the rats were randomly assigned to additional groups as follows: a sham-operated control group treated with saline (control, n= 10); an A\u00df1-42 peptide-treated group treated with saline (model, n= 9); an A\u00df1-42 peptide-treated group treated with 0.45 mg/kg donepezil (positive, n= 10); 3 A\u00df1-42 peptide-treated group treated respectively with low (100 g/kg, n= 11), middle (250 g/kg, n= 10) and high (500 g/kg, n= 8) dose of SC-extract. Saline, donepezil and SC-extract were taken via intragastric administration and continued for 30 days. At the end of the experiment, serum and colon content samples of all groups were collected for SCFAs analysis. The scheme of animal experiments was shown in <strong>Fig 1a</strong> of the paper associated with this study.</p>",
