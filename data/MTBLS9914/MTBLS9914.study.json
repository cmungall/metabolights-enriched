                "description": "<p>Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) mutations can result in clonal hematopoiesis (CH) with heterogeneous clinical outcomes. Here, we investigated how the cell state preceding <em>Tet2</em> mutation impacts the pre-malignant phenotype. Using an inducible system for clonal analysis of myeloid progenitors, we found that the epigenetic features of clones at similar differentiation status were highly heterogeneous and functionally responded differently to <em>Tet2</em> mutation. Cell differentiation stage also influenced <em>Tet2</em> mutation response indicating that the cell of origin's epigenome modulates clone-specific behaviors in CH. Molecular features associated with higher risk outcomes include <em>Sox4</em> that sensitized cells to <em>Tet2</em> inactivation, inducing dedifferentiation, altered metabolism and increasing the <em>in vivo</em> clonal output of mutant cells, as confirmed in primary GMP and HSC models. Our findings validate the hypothesis that epigenetic features can predispose specific clones for dominance, explaining why identical genetic mutations can result in different phenotypes.</p>",

Filtered BM cells were layered over Ficoll-Plaque-Plus (GE Healthcare Biosciences), and centrifuged at 400 x g for 25 min at RT without break to enrich for mononuclear cells. Cells were incubated in a 6-well tissue culture plate for 48 h at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2 prior to the retroviral transduction in RPMI (RPMI-1640, Corning) with 10% 2 mM L-glutamine and 100 U penicillin/streptomycin (all from Thermo Fisher), supplemented with 20 ng/mL stem cell factor (mSCF), 10 ng/mL interleukin-764 3 (mIL-3) and 10 ng/mL interleukin-6 (mIL-6). Non-adherent cells were harvested and 5 x 10^5 cells were plated onto a 12-well tissue culture plate (Corning) coated with 10 mg/mL human fibronectin (Sigma). 1 mL of ecotropic retrovirus encoding MSCVneo-HA-ER-Hoxb8 was applied in the presence of 8 mg/mL polybrene and spinoculation was performed at 1000 x g for 60 min at RT. After transduction cells were maintained in RPMI supplemented with 0.5 \u03bcM beta-estradiol (Sigma, E2758) and conditioned media containing approximately 100 ng/mL SCF for the generation of neutrophil-biased cells or GM-CSF 10 ng/mL (Peprotech) for the generation of macrophage progenitors. Antibiotic selection was performed by adding G418 at 1 mg/mL final concentration until untransduced control cells the control were not viable (usually ~7 days). After selection, cells were FACS sorted into 96 well plates with culture media for the generation of single cell clones. For generation of Tet2 KO lines, each clone was transduced with integrase-defective lentiviral vector encoding for Cre recombinase or GFP as control at a Multiplicity of Infection (MOI) of 200.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Metabolomics Analysis</strong></p><p>Briefly, HOXB8 Granulocytic-Monocytic Progenitors (GMP) clones were grown in RPMI medium supplemented with 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin, 1% Glutamine, 0.5 \u03bcM beta-estradiol and CHO conditioned media containing ~100 ng/mL SCF.

The mass accuracy was within a 3 ppm range. Internal calibration was used.

Data dependent MS3 was acquired on the top 3 fragments using a 40% CID fragmentation and analyzing the fragment in the orbitrap at 15,000 resolution. Samples were analyzed in MS1 only. First a solvent blank and an injection of the pool were run, acquiring only MS1 data. All peaks found in the blank were added to an exclusion list. All peak found in the Pool sample were added to an inclusion list. The pool sample was then reinjected and analyzed in MS2/3 mode, in positive and negative mode separately, using the inclusion and exclusion lists to select the ions to fragment. All peaks that were fragmented in the run were then added to the exclusion list and removed from the inclusion list. The sample was reinjected a total 4 times to achieve as much MS2/3 coverage as possible (DeepScan mode for AquireX).

MS2/3 data from the pool samples were associated with the corresponding peaks. If a compound in samples was always less than 5 fold the average intensity in the blanks, it was removed from the results. Data was gap filled by reintegrating peaks or local noise for samples where a peak was not original detected. Intensities were median centered by sample. Targeted metabolite measurements were normalized to the internal 13C/15N-labelled amino acid standard. For untargeted metabolomics functional analysis, area and m/z (as [M+H]+ adducts calculated from the monoisotopic masses generated in CD) were processed using Metaboanalyst 5.0 software. Positive ion mode, 5.0 ppm tolerance and retention time (min) were provided as input parameters. Mouse KEGG database was used for Mummichog Pathway Analysis. For all files, msConvert (ProteoWizard) was used to generate the mzML files, with peak picking selected to centroid the data.</p>",
