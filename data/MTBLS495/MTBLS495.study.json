                "description": "<p><strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong> The absolute quantitation of lipids at the lipidome-wide scale is a challenge but plays an important role in the comprehensive study of lipid metabolism. </p><p><strong>OBJECTIVES:</strong> We aim to develop a high-throughput quantitative lipidomics approach to enable the simultaneous identification and absolute quantification of hundreds of lipids in a single experiment. Then, we will systematically characterize lipidome-wide changes in the aging mouse brain and provide a link between aging and disordered lipid homeostasis. </p><p><strong>METHODS:</strong> We created an in-house lipid spectral library, containing 76,361 lipids and 181,300 MS/MS spectra in total, to support accurate lipid identification. Then, we developed a response factor-based approach for the large-scale absolute quantifications of lipids. </p><p><strong>RESULTS:</strong> Using the lipidomics approach, we absolutely quantified 1212 and 864 lipids in human cells and mouse brains, respectively. The quantification accuracy was validated using the traditional approach with a median relative error of 12.6%. We further characterized the lipidome-wide changes in aging mouse brains, and dramatic changes were observed in both glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids. Sphingolipids with longer acyl chains tend to accumulate in aging brains. Membrane-esterified fatty acids demonstrated diverse changes with aging, while most polyunsaturated fatty acids consistently decreased. </p><p><strong>CONCLUSION:</strong> We developed a high-throughput quantitative lipidomics approach and systematically characterized the lipidome-wide changes in aging mouse brains. The results proved a link between aging and disordered lipid homeostasis. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Mouse brain NEG UPLC-MS assay</strong> data is reported in the current study <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS495' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS495</strong></a>.</p><p><strong>Mouse brain POS UPLC-MS assay</strong> data associated to this study is reported in <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS562' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS562</strong></a>.</p>",

Protein concentration in the homogenized solution was measured using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Catalog No. 23225, Thermo Fisher). Then, 50 \u03bcl of homogenized solution was taken and diluted to 2000 \u03bcl using water. Then, 4800 \u03bcl of the extraction solvent (MTBE:MeOH =5:1, v/v) containing 1 \u03bcl of SIL-IS (d7-PE (15:0/18:1), 100 ppm) was added. The solution was vortexed for 30 s, followed by 10 min of sonication, and centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 15 min. The upper organic layer was collected. And an additional 2000 \u03bcl of MTBE was added to the bottom layer for re-extraction. The re-extraction was repeated twice. The pooled organic layer was evaporated using a vacuum concentrator. The dry extract was reconstituted using 100 \u03bcl of DCM:MeOH (1:1, v/v) prior to LC\u2013MS/MS analysis.",

Chromatographic separations were performed on a Phenomenex Kinetex C18 column (particle size, 1.7 \u03bcm; 100 mm (length) x 2.1 mm (i.d.)) with a column temperature of 55 \u00b0C. The mobile phases A = 10 mM ammonium formate in H2O:ACN (6:4, v/v), and B = 10 mM ammonium formate in IPA:ACN (9:1, v/v), were used for both ESI positive and negative modes. The linear gradient elutes from 40 to 100% B (0\u201312min), 100% B (12\u201314min), 100 to 40% B (14\u201314.2 min), then equilibrate at 40% B until 18 min.

The raw data files (.wiff format) were converted to files in mzXML format using the 'msconvert' program from ProteoWizard (version 3.0.6526). Then the mzxML files were loaded into LipidAnalyzer for data processing. Peak detection was first operated on MS1 data. CentWave algorithm in XCMS was used for peak detection. The parameter 'peakwidth' was set as (5, 25) in unit of seconds, referring to the minimum and maximum peak widths for peak detection. The parameter 'snthresh' is set as 3 for sensitive peak detection. For multiple LC-MS data files, ordered bijective interpolated warping (OBI-Warp) algorithm in XCMS was used for peak alignment. CAMERA package is used for peak annotation. As a result, a peak table, including m/z, retention time (RT), and peak area information, was generated.\n</p>\nNext, we extracted the MS/MS spectra for each feature according to the m/z and RT. If 1 precursor ion is fragmented multiple times, the MS/MS spectrum closest to the peak apex was extracted and subjected to de-noising processing. Specifically, fragment ions in the MS/MS spectrum with intensity less than 30 counts or lower than 3% of the most abundant fragment ions (except precursor ion) were discarded. Besides, satellite ions (due to the ringing effect) close to main peak with mass difference less than 0.3 Da and relative intensity less than 20% were also removed. With the MS/MS spectrum, lipid identification was achieved through the spectral match using an in-house MS/MS spectral library. First, accurate mass match was performed to search all lipid species in the library with a mass tolerance of 25 ppm. Next, for each matched lipid, the corresponding experimental MS/MS spectrum was used to calculate the similarity with the MS2 spectrum in the library.\n</p>\nFinally, the absolute quantitation of lipids can be achieved using the peak area together with the SIL-IS and RF information.",
