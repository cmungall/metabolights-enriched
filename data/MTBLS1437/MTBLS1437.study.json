                "description": "<p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> The gut-brain axis and the intestinal microbiota are emerging as key players in health and disease. Shifts in intestinal microbiota composition affect a variety of systems, however, evidence of their direct impact on cognitive functions is still lacking. We tested whether faecal microbiota transplant (FMT) from aged donor mice into young adult recipients affected the hippocampus, an area of the central nervous system (CNS) known to be affected by the ageing process, and related functions.</p><p><strong>METHODS AND FINDINGS: </strong>Young adult mice were transplanted with the microbiota from either aged or age-matched donor mice. Following transplantation, characterization of the microbiotas and metabolomics profiles along with a battery of cognitive and behavioural tests were performed. Label-free quantitative proteomics was employed to monitor protein expression in the hippocampus of the recipients. Gut permeability, levels of circulating cytokines and expression of markers of microglia cells were also assessed. FMT from aged donors led to impaired spatial learning and memory in young adult recipients, whereas anxiety, explorative behaviour and locomotor activity remained unaffected. This was paralleled by altered expression of proteins involved in synaptic plasticity and neurotransmission in the hippocampus. Also, a strong reduction of bacteria associated with short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) production (<em>Lachnospiraceae</em>, <em>Faecalibaculum</em> and <em>Ruminococcaceae</em>) and disorders of the CNS (<em>Prevotellaceae</em> and <em>Ruminococcaceae</em>) was observed. Finally, microglia cells of the hippocampus fimbria, acquired an ageing-like phenotype, while gut permeability and levels of circulating cytokines remained unaffected.</p><p><strong>CONCLUSIONS:</strong> These results demonstrate a direct effect of the age-associated shifts of the microbiota on protein expression and key functions of the central nervous system. Furthermore, these results additionally highlight the paramount importance of the gut-brain axis in ageing and provide a strong rationale to devise therapies aiming to restore a young-like microbiota to improve cognitive functions in the elderly.</p>",

Mice (Envigo, Varese, Italy or Charles River, UK) were provided with food and water ad libitum. Environmental temperature was kept at 23\u00b11 \u00b0C with a 12 h light/dark cycle. All efforts were made to minimize animal suffering and to reduce the number of animals used.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Faecal material preparation and FMT regime</strong></p><p>Faecal material was collected from adult and aged mice and placed into Eppendorf tubes containing 500 mL of freezing solution (sterile saline solution with 12.5% glycerol), tubes were left on ice for 60 min and later homogenized for 2 min on ice using a hand-held electric pellet pestle device with sterile, re-usable pestles. When fully homogenized, the suspended pellets were frozen and stored at -80 \u00b0C until utilized for the FMT procedure. To this end, mice were randomized into the following treatment groups (n=12 per group): control (no antibiotic treatment, no FMT); FMT-adult (antibiotic treatment followed by FMT from young age-matched donors), FMT-aged (antibiotic treatments followed by FMT from aged donors). Antibiotic mix was prepared in autoclaved drinking water and provided in 250 mL clear glass slippers or suspended in 1% carboxymethylcellulose sodium salt (CMC; Sigma-Aldrich) and administered by oral gavage. The antibiotic/anti-fungal regime was as follows: day 1-3 mice were gavaged daily with anti-fungal treatment with amphotericin B 1 mg/kg, day 4-17 mice received a daily gavage of metronidazole 100 mg/kg while the antibiotic mix (ampicillin 1 g/L, vancomycin 0.5 g/L and neomicin 1 g/L was added to drinking water), day 18-24 daily oral gavage with ampicillin 1 g/L, vancomycin 0.5 g/L, neomicin 1 g/L, metronidazole 100 mg/kg, amphotericin B 1 mg/kg. FMT was carried out via oral gavage with a faecal suspension (100 mg/mL) in a final volume of 150 mL. FMT was performed 6 times on days 24-28 and 35 from the beginning of antibiotic regime.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>It is made available under a CC-BY 4.0 International license (not yet peer-reviewed) by the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity. bioRxiv preprint first posted online Dec. 6, 2019 (http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/866459).
