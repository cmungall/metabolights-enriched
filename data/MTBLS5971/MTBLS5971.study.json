                "description": "<p>Kidney injury initiates epithelial dedifferentiation and myofibroblast activation during the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Herein, we found that the expression of DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) was significantly increased in the kidney tissues of both CKD patients and CKD mice induced by unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) and unilateral ischemia-reperfusion (UIR) injury. In vivo, knockout of DNA-PKcs or treatment with its specific inhibitor NU7441 hampered the development of CKD in mice. In vitro, DNA-PKcs deficiency preserved epithelial cell phenotype and inhibited fibroblast activation induced by transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta-1). Additionally, our results showed that TBP-associated factor 7 (TAF7), as a possible substrate of DNA-PKcs, enhanced mTORC1 activation by upregulating RAPTOR expression, which subsequently promoted metabolic reprogramming in injured epithelial cells and myofibroblasts. Taken together, DNA-PKcs can be inhibited to correct metabolic reprogramming via the TAF7/mTORC1 signaling in CKD, and serve as a new target for treating CKD.</p>",

                        "description": "<p><strong>DNA-PKcs-/- mice, Cas9 mice and animal models</strong></p><p>DNA-PKcs knockout (DNA-PKcs-/-) mice on a BALB/c background were generated and purchased from GemPharmatech (Nanjing, China). Briefly, a 561 bp sequence of prkdc (the DNA-PKcs-encoded gene) between exon 6 and exon 7 was deleted using the CRISPR/Cas9 method. DNA-PKcs-/- mice and wild-type (WT) littermates were bred in the Laboratory Animal Center of Nanjing Medical University (Nanjing, China) and genotyped using PCR (primers are listed in Table S2 in the paper associated with this study). Mice were maintained in a standard specific pathogen-free (SPF) animal room free access to food and water with a light/dark cycle of 12 h. To construct proximal renal tubular epithelial cells with specific Cas9 transgenic mice, Rosa26-LSL-Cas9 knockin mice (purchased from GemPharmatech), as described in a previous study<strong>[1]</strong>, were bred with Kap-Cre mice (purchased from Jackson). Kap+cas9+ mice were genotyped using PCR (primers were listed in Table S2). To generate renal tubular specific knockout of DNA-PKcs, Kap+cas9+ mice were given subcapsular injection of adeno-associated virus (AAV8) containing guide RNA (gRNA) for DNA-PKcs (5 x 10^11 genome copies per mouse according to a previous study<strong>[2]</strong>. Kap+cas9+ mice treated with AAV8 carrying gRNA empty vectors were used as controls. AAV8 carrying gRNA (U6 promoter) for mouse DNA-PKcs (listed in Table S2) and empty vectors were purchased from WZ Biosciences Inc (Jinan, China). Mouse renal fibrosis models were generated as previously reported<strong>[3]</strong>. Briefly, mice were anesthetized using isoflurane (3% for induction and 1.5% for maintenance). For the unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) model, mice were divided into 2 groups: the UUO and sham control groups. For UUO surgery, a flank incision was made on the left side of the abdomen, and the left ureter was tied off using two 4.0 surgical silk ties below the renal pelvis. For the sham groups, the surgery was performed as in the UUO group but without ureteral ligation. For unilateral ischemia\u2013reperfusion surgery (UIR), the renal pedicle of the left kidney was clamped using a nontraumatic microaneurysm clamp (RWD Life Science, Shenzhen, China) for 30 min, and the color change of the kidney confirmed successful ischemia\u2013reperfusion. Body temperatures of the mice were maintained at 36-38 \u00b0C throughout the surgery using a heating instrument. To examine the effects of a DNA-PK inhibitor (NU7441) in the UUO and UIR mouse models, 6- to 8-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were purchased from GemPharmatech (Nanjing, China). For the UUO model, one day after surgery, mice oral gavage with or without 40 mg/kg/d NU-7441 in 10% PEG400 in saline until euthanasia once daily. For the UIR model, three days after surgery, mice were dosed once daily by oral gavage with or without 40 mg/kg/d NU-7441 until euthanasia. Mice were euthanized on day 3, 7, or 14 after UUO and on day 21 after UIR. Kidney samples were collected and stored at -80 \u00b0C for further analysis. Animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Nanjing Medical University.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Metabolomics analysis</strong></p><p>To understand how metabolic reprogramming was improved in DNA-PKcs-/- mice, we used metabolomics profiling to analyze metabolite changes following UUO surgery. For sample collection, mice were divided into 4 groups (4 mice of each group): the UUO and sham control groups of DNA-PKcs ko mice and wild-type (WT) littermates (about 8 weeks old). After the mice were subjected to UUO surgery for 7 days, the mice were sacrificed, and the kidneys were collected and stored in dry ice. Metabolomics analysis of kidney tissues was performed by BioNovogene (Suzhou, China).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Platt RJ, Chen S, Zhou Y, Yim MJ, Swiech L, Kempton HR, Dahlman JE, Parnas O, Eisenhaure TM, Jovanovic M, Graham DB, Jhunjhunwala S, Heidenreich M, Xavier RJ, Langer R, Anderson DG, Hacohen N, Regev A, Feng G, Sharp PA, Zhang F.

For peak picking. the following parameters were used: centWave, m/z = 25/15 ppm, peakwidth = c(10,60)/(5,30), prefilter = c(10,100). For peak grouping, bw = 5/2, mzwid = 0.025/0.015, minfrac = 0.5 were used, In the extracted ion features, only the variables having more than 50% of the nonzero measurement values in at least one group were kept.
