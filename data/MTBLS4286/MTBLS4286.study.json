                "description": "<p>Plant monocultures growing for extended periods face severe losses of productivity. This phenomenon, known as 'yield decline', is often caused by the accumulation of above- and below-ground plant antagonists. The effectiveness of plant defences against antagonists might help explain differences in yield decline among species. Using a trait-based approach, we studied the role of 20 physical and chemical defence traits of leaves and fine roots on yield decline of 4- and 18-year-old monocultures of 27 grassland species. We hypothesized that yield decline is lower for species with high defences, that root defences are better predictors of yield decline than leaf defences, and that in roots, physical defences better predict yield decline than chemical defences, while the reverse is true for leaves. We additionally hypothesized that the relationship between defences and yield decline increase with time and that species increasing the expression of defence traits after long-term monoculture growth would suffer less yield decline. We summarized leaf and fine root defence traits using principal component analysis and analysed the relationship between the most informative components as well as their temporal changes and monoculture yield decline. The significant predictors of yield decline were traits related to the so-called collaboration gradient of the root economics space (specific root length and root diameter) as well as their temporal changes and traits related to the leaf physical vs chemical defence trade-off (leaf dry matter, silicon and cellulose content, toughness and phytochemical diversity). We were unable to unequivocally identify the mechanisms relating the effect of those traits to yield decline as they could mediate plant responses to several stressor such as antagonist nutrient depletion and drought. Further studies are needed to differentiate between these alternative mechanisms and gain a comprehensive understanding of the drivers behind the impact of root and leaf defence traits on yield decline.</p>",

                        "description": "<p><strong>Study site and experimental design</strong></p><p>The monocultures sampled in this study are part of a large grassland biodiversity experiment, the Jena Experiment. The experiment is located along the Saale River\u2019s floodplain near Jena (Thuringia, Germany, latitude 50.95, longitude 11.62, altitude 130 m a.s.l.). The regional mean annual air temperature is 9.9 \u00b0C, and annual precipitation is 660 mm (1980-2010) 1. In 1960, the experimental site was converted from grassland to a highly-fertilized arable field until the start of the experiment. In total 60 species of the Arrhenatherion mesophilic grassland type 2 belonging to 4 functional groups were selected for the experiment. The classification of functional groups was based on above- and below-ground functional traits and differentiates grasses (16 species), legumes (12 species), small herbs (12 species) and tall herbs (20 species) 3. For each of the 60 species, 2 monocultures were established randomly within the 4 blocks of the experiment in 3.5 x 3.5 m plots. Monocultures were sown in May 2002 using 1000 viable seeds per m^2. In November 2002, species with no or spare cover were re-sown 3,4. After that, no additional sowing was done. In 2008, 1 of the 2 monoculture replicates was abandoned, and in 2009 the plots were reduced to 1 x 1 m. We hereafter refer to these monocultures as \u2018old monocultures\u2019.</p><p><br></p><p>In 2016, additional monoculture plots of 1 m^2 for all 60 species, hereafter called \u2018young monocultures\u2019, were established randomly within the 4 blocks of the experiment in soil not previously conditioned by the target species. To reproduce the original soil conditions at the start of the Jena Experiment, the top 30 cm of the soil were removed and replaced with soil from an adjacent field (north of the site). A 30 cm deep plastic sheet barrier was placed around the plots to avoid contamination of the new soil from the area outside the plot. The young soil had been under the same management regime as the experimental site prior to the start of the Jena experiment. Laboratory analysis of the young soil confirmed that the soil structure, carbon content and nutrient content closely resemble conditions of the soil in 2002 5. Seeds from the same supplier as in 2002, were sown in the young soil using the same approach used for the old monocultures in 2002.</p><p><br></p><p>Both, old and young monocultures, were maintained by weeding of non-target species 2-3 times per year in spring, summer and autumn 6. Plots were mowed in June and September every year, and the biomass removed to simulate the common hay meadow management of the region.</p><p><br></p><p>At the time of sampling for this study in May 2020, the old monocultures were 18 years old while the young monocultures were 4 years old and thus 14 years younger than the old monocultures. In the young monocultures, plant-soil feedback effects should not yet be well established or strong enough to promote yield decline and in turn phenotypic or genotypic plant functional trait responses. The comparison between old and young monocultures allows us to use the spatial domain instead of the temporal domain to investigate the effect of time on plant-soil feedback effects and yield decline. The advantage of this experimental design is that our analysis is independent of different climatic conditions between years.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Leaf and fine root sample collection</strong></p><p>The sampling campaign was conducted from May 18th to June 5th 2020, after the plots were weeded. Sampling was restricted to the morning from 7 to 11 am to minimize chemical trait shifts during the day. In total 27 species were sampled in both monoculture types (young and old) for 54 plots. In each of the monocultures, we sampled the above- and below-ground part of 3-5 individuals to account for intraspecific trait variation. We first harvested the above-ground plant part by cutting the stem 1-2 cm above the ground. Each plant individual was stored in a separate, sealed plastic bag with a wet paper towel to ensure leaves rehydrated to full potential before trait measurements 7. We then sampled the roots of each individual by collecting a 5 x 10 cm (diameter x depth) soil core with the remaining part of the stem in the centre of the core. The cores of individual root systems were stored together in a sealed plastic bag. All sampled material was stored in a dark cooling box. Samples were stored at 4 \u00b0C in the lab for a maximum of 6 h after sampling. Sample processing started 6 h after the collection of the first sample and ended within 26 h. Above- and below-ground samples were processed in parallel.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Leaf and root preparation </strong></p><p>All fully-expanded and undamaged leaves of each individual were separated from the rest of the aboveground portion of the plant, and rachis and petioles were removed. All leaves were pooled at the plot level and used to measure the fresh weight and leaf area with a flatbed Epson Expression 11000XL scanner at 600DPI resolution (EPSON Tokyo, Japan). Leaves were then frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 \u00b0C until the end of the sampling campaign. We washed roots from the soil by soaking soil cores in cold water for 15 min. We then removed the soil by gently massaging the core inside a bucket filled with water to avoid the rupture of roots. We refreshed the water in the bucket by filtering the water with soil debris into a sieve and collected fine root fragments. We repeated this procedure until the roots were completely free of soil particles. Only fine roots attached to the stem of the correct species or large fine root fragments that were unequivocally identified as being from the same species using dissecting microscopes were kept for further processing. We bulked the fine roots of each individual at the plot level and discarded all coarse roots with a diameter larger than 2 mm. Fine roots with a diameter lower than 2 were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 \u00b0C to be used for chemical analyses. Fine roots and leaves were</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Hoffmann K, Bivour W, Fr\u00fch B, Ko\u00dfmann M, Vo\u00df PH.
