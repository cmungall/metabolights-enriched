                "description": "Endometrial cancer (EC) is one of the most common gynecological cancers. Finding biomarkers of EC can support its diagnosis in a non- or minimally-invasive way. In this work, we integrated metabolomics and proteomics for the analysis of multiple types of biosamples to gain a more comprehensive view on the altered metabolism in EC patients, and to demonstrate the potential of metabolite biomarker-based EC diagnosis. Based on the differential metabolites and proteins between EC patients and controls detected in the endometrial tissue samples, EC related significant pathways, such as amino acid metabolism and nucleotide metabolism, were identified. Then, the significance of the pathways was further demonstrated by metabolomic analysis of urine and intrauterine brushings samples. We also demonstrated the potential of EC diagnosis by metabolite biomarkers in urine or intrauterine brushings samples. This study provides a network explanation of the metabolic changes of EC with the verification by multi-omics and multi-biosamples, and further demonstrates the potential of non- or minimally-invasive biopsy for EC diagnosis in the future.",

MS1 signal intensities were then normalized by the summation of all peaks for an individual sample to calculate relative quantitative information, and were performed with log transformation and auto scaling to form the matrices for subsequent statistical analysis.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1] </strong>Chambers MC, Maclean B, Burke R, Amodei D, Ruderman DL, Neumann S, Gatto L, Fischer B, Pratt B, Egertson J, Hoff K, Kessner D, Tasman N, Shulman N, Frewen B, Baker TA, Brusniak MY, Paulse C, Creasy D, Flashner L, Kani K, Moulding C, Seymour SL, Nuwaysir LM, Lefebvre B, Kuhlmann F, Roark J, Rainer P, Detlev S, Hemenway T, Huhmer A, Langridge J, Connolly B, Chadick T, Holly K, Eckels J, Deutsch EW, Moritz RL, Katz JE, Agus DB, MacCoss M, Tabb DL, Mallick P.
