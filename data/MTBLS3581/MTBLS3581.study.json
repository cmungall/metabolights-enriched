                "description": "<p>Exposure to environmental pollutants and human microbiome composition are important predisposition factors for tumour development. Similar to drug molecules, pollutants are typically metabolised in the body, which can change their carcinogenic potential and impact tissue distribution through altered toxicokinetics. Although recent studies demonstrated that human-associated microbes can chemically convert a wide range of xenobiotics and influence the profile and tissue exposure of resulting metabolites, the effect of microbial biotransformation on chemical-induced tumour development remains unclear. Here we show that the depletion of the gut microbiota dramatically reduces the development and severity of nitrosamine-induced urinary bladder cancer in mice, which affects the toxicokinetics of nitrosamines. We causally linked this carcinogen biotransformation to specific gut bacterial isolates in vitro and in vivo using individualized bacterial culture collections and gnotobiotic mouse models, respectively. We tested gut communities from different human donors to demonstrate that microbial carcinogen metabolism varies between individuals and we showed that this metabolic activity applies to structurally related nitrosamine-carcinogens. Altogether, these results suggest gut microbiota carcinogen metabolism as a contributing factor for chemical-induced carcinogenesis, which could open avenues to target the microbiome for improved predisposition risk assessment and prevention of cancer.</p>",

                        "description": "<p><strong>Animal experiments</strong></p><p>In brief, 2-month-old C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Laboratory, USA and Charles River, USA) housed in the animal facility of the University of Split School of Medicine were used for all conventional mouse experiments. In brief, 2-month-old germ-free C57BL/6J mice housed in the animal facility of European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) were used for all gnotobiotic mouse experiments. Animals were kept in individually ventilated cages with autoclaved bedding (Mucedola), with a 12-h light-dark cycle, controlled temperature (21-24 \u00b0C) and humidity (30-70%), and ad libitum access to food (gamma-irradiated, Ssniff-Spezialdi\u00e4ten GmbH) and autoclaved water. Male mice were used in all experiments unless differently specified. All mouse experiments were approved by the local IACUC (The University of Split, School of Medicine, Animal Welfare Committee and EMBL IACUC) and the national regulating authorities (Republic of Croatia Ministry of Agriculture, Veterinary and Food Safety Directorate) (permit numberss 525-10/0255-14-4,525-10/0255-15-5, 525-10/0543-21-8, 525-09/566-22-2 and 21-002_HD_MZ). All mice were randomly allocated into experimental groups while blinding was not performed except for the pathohistological analysis. No sample size calculation was performed. The general status of the animals including behavior, appearance and body weight was monitored. If signs of pain, suffering, or weight loss of more than 20% were observed humane end-points were applied. Those limits were not exceeded in any of the experiments. For ex vivo BBN conversion experiments and 16S rRNA sequencing using conventional mice, contents from 3 parts of the small intestines, cecum, large intestines and rectum were collected from 5 mice of both sexes. One half of each sample was frozen at -80 \u00b0C in 20% glycerol, and the other half was frozen at -80 \u00b0C and used for 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. For LC-MS quantification, tissues collected were directly frozen at -80 \u00b0C until further processing.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Long- and short-term nitrosamine treatments with conventional or germ-free mice</strong></p><p>Male conventional mice were randomly assigned to ABX/BBN or BBN group. The ABX/BBN group received 100 \u00b5g/mL neomycin, 100 \u00b5g/mL metronidazole, 50 \u00b5g/mL streptomycin and 67.7 \u00b5g/mL penicillin (all from Sigma-Aldrich) and 50 \u00b5g/mL vancomycin (Pharma Swiss) in drinking water which was supplied fresh weekly. Following 2 months of treatment, the antibiotic mixture was changed to 1000\u2009\u00b5g/mL streptomycin, 170\u2009\u03bcg/mL gentamicin (Krka), 125\u2009\u03bcg/mL ciprofloxacin (MCE) and 1000 \u00b5g/mL bacitracin (Sigma-Aldrich), in order to prevent development and overgrowth of resistant bacterial strains<strong>[1]</strong>. The ABX/BBN group received antibiotics 2 weeks before starting the BBN treatment, and were kept on antibiotics for the remaining duration of the experiment.</p><p><br></p><p>For gnotobiotic mouse experiments, male germ-free mice were inoculated by oral gavage with 100-250 \u00b5L microbial community culture or single bacterial isolate culture for 4 days. ABX/BBN group would receive the first ABX mixture for 2 weeks before starting BBN treatment for 10 days. During BBN treatment, the second ABX mixtures was used for the ABX/BBN group.</p><p><br></p><p>Monitoring of the impact of antibiotic treatment on the gut microbiota was performed using a combination of colony forming units (CFU) counting and 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing (microbiome composition). For CFU counting, fecal pellets from both groups were diluted (1 g in 10 mL) in PBS and homogenized by vortexing. Decimal dilutions (from 10^-1 to 10^-9) were prepared and grown on blood agar (TSA, 10% blood) at 37 \u00b0C under aerobic and anaerobic conditions prepared with gaspacks AnaeroGen (Thermofisher). CFUs were calculated using two successive dilutions. For 16S rRNA sequencing, fecal pellets were collected from mice and DNA was extracted using PowerSoil Kit (QIAGEN). Sequencing was performed on an Illumina platform generating 250 bp pair-end sequences of the V4 region.</p><p><br></p><p>After checking the effects of antibiotics, both groups of mice were given the nitrosamines (0.05% BBN, 2.87 mM EHBN, DBN and PBN) in drinking water. BBN was administered for 12 weeks, after which the chemical was removed from drinking water for 8 weeks. PBN was administered for 17 weeks, while EHBN and DBN were administered for 20 weeks<strong>[2][3]</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p>For tissue collection, mice treated with BBN and EHBN were euthanized by inhalation of CO2, and intestinal contents, liver, kidney, urinary bladder and plasma were collected and frozen at -80 \u00b0C until further analyses. Bladder tissues were cut in half longitudinally, half of which were frozen for metabolomics quantification and the other half was fixed for histopathology analyses.</p><p><br></p><p>For monitoring urinary and fecal excretion, 24-h urine and fecal samples from mice treated with all chemicals were collected using metabolic cages (Techniplast). Mice were placed inside cages supplied with food and water (supplemented with nitrosamines with or without ABX for respective groups) for 24 h and fecal material and urine was collected from the collection tubes as well as from the surfaces of the cages. Samples were weighted and stored at -80 \u00b0C until further analyses.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Grivennikov SI, Wang K, Mucida D, Stewart CA, Schnabl B, Jauch D, Taniguchi K, Yu GY, Osterreicher CH, Hung KE, Datz C, Feng Y, Fearon ER, Oukka M, Tessarollo L, Coppola V, Yarovinsky F, Cheroutre H, Eckmann L, Trinchieri G, Karin M.
