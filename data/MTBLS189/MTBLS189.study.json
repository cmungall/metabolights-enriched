                "description": "Astragali Radix (AR) is a commonly used herbal drug in Traditional Chinese Medicine, and widely used for the treatment of diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, nephropathy and neuropathy. The main source of AR is the dried root of Astragalus membranaceus var. mongholicus (Bge.) Hsiao in China, and both cultivated and wild ARs are used in the clinic. Systematic comparison of cultivated AR and wild AR should be performed to ensure the efficacy and safety in clinic. In this study, the chemical compositions of two different ARs, collected in Shanxi (wild) and Gansu (cultivated) Provinces, were compared by NMR based metabolic fingerprint coupled with multivariate analysis. Then SX-AR and GS-AR induced metabolic changes of endogenous metabolites in mice were also compared. The results showed that SX-AR and GS-AR differed significantly not only in the primary metabolites, but also the secondary metabolites. However, alterations of endogenous metabolites in serum, lung, liver and spleen were relatively small between them. This study provided a novel and valuable method for consistency and diversity evaluation of herbal drugs, and further studies should be conducted on the difference of polysaccharide as well as biological effect between the two kinds of ARs.",

The voucher specimens were deposited in the herbarium of Modern Research Center for Traditional Chinese Medicine of Shanxi University.\n</p>\nSerum and tissue samples:</br>\nThe freeze-dried extract (see Extraction section below) was suspended in distilled water to 1.0 g/ml, which is equivalent to the crude drug. According to the extraction yields, the final concentrations of SX-AR and GS-AR were 0.31 and 0.33 g/ml, respectively. For the low dose group, the drug concentration was diluted to 0.25 g/ml (equivalent to the crude drug). The animal study was performed according to the International Rules Concerning Animal Experiments and the Internationally Accepted Ethical Principles for Laboratory Animal Use and Care. Male 4-week-old Kunming (KM) mice, weighing 18\u201322 g, were purchased from the Experimental Animal Center of the Academy of Military Medical Sciences of the Chinese People\u2019s Liberation Army [SCXK (Military) 2012\u20130004]. All animals were housed at room temperature (20\u201325 \u00b0C) and constant humidity (40\u201370%) under a 12 h light/dark cycle in Specific Pathogen Free (SPF) grade laboratory conditions. Animals were allowed to have access to food and water ad libitum except for fasting periods before experiments.\n</p>\nAfter a 1 week adaptive feeding period, KM mice were randomly divided into 5 groups (n = 8) for a 7 day treatment intervention: a control group (NS), a GS-AR low dose group (GS-AR-L), a GS-AR high dose group (GS-AR-H), an SX-AR low dose group (SX-AR-L), and an SX-AR high dose group (SX-AR-H). Aqueous extracts of AR were administrated into the mice via gavage for the low dose (5 g/kg, equivalent to the crude drug) and high dose (20 g/kg, equivalent to the crude drug) groups, and the control group was given the same volume of distilled water. A total volume of 0.2 ml per 10 g of body weight was administered to the mouse once a day.\n</p>\nBlood (0.5\u20130.8 ml) was withdrawn from the retro-orbital plexus of the mice and collected into Eppendorf tubes on the 8th day after fasting for 12 h. The blood was then separated using refrigerated centrifugation at 13 000 rpm for 10 min to afford the serum. The serum samples and liver, spleen, and lung tissues were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 \u00b0C for further analysis.",

In the first procedure (M1), the freeze-dried powder (about 30 mg) was redissolved in KH2PO4 buffer in D2O (adjusted to pH 6.0 by 1 M NaOD) containing 0.05% TSP. The sample was then centrifuged for 10 min at 13 000 rpm. The supernatants (600 \u00b5l) of all the samples were transferred into 5 mm NMR tubes for NMR analysis. In the second procedure (M2), 4 g of freeze-dried powder was suspended in 100 ml of water and partitioned by an equal volume of petroleum ether, EtOAc, and n-BuOH in sequence. The soluble fractions in petroleum ether (M2P), EtOAc (M2E), and n-BuOH (M2B) and the residual water (M2W) fractions were transferred separately into round-bottomed flasks and taken to dryness with a rotary vacuum evaporator. The M2P and M2E samples were redissolved in CDCl3 and CD3OD, respectively, whereas the M2B and M2W samples were reconstituted in KH2PO4 buffer in D2O. All the samples were transferred into 5 mm NMR tubes for NMR analysis.\n</p>\nSerum and tissue samples:</br>\nEach serum sample (300 \u00b5l) was mixed with 300 \u00b5l of D2O and centrifuged (13 000 rpm, 4 \u00b0C, 10 min), after which 550 \u00b5l of the supernatant was transferred into 5 mm NMR tubes for NMR analysis. The resultant liver, spleen, and lung supernatants were centrifuged (13 000 rpm, 4 \u00b0C, 10 min), lyophilized in nitrogen flow, and redissolved into 600 \u00b5l of phosphate buffer (0.1 M, KH2PO4/Na2HPO4, pH 7.4) containing 0.01% TSP and 10% D2O. After final centrifugation (13 000 rpm, 4 \u00b0C, 10 min), each supernatant (550 \u00b5l) was transferred into a 5 mm NMR tube for NMR analysis.",
