                "description": "Multi-omics analyses are increasingly employed in microbiome studies to obtain a holistic view of molecular changes occurring within microbial communities exposed to different conditions. However, it is not always clear to what extent each omics data type contributes to our understanding of the community dynamics and whether they are concordant with each other. Here we map the molecular response of a synthetic community of 32 human gut bacteria to three non-antibiotic drugs by using five omics layers, namely 16S rRNA gene profiling, metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, metaproteomics, and metabolomics. Using this controlled setting, we find that all omics methods with species resolution in their readouts are highly consistent in estimating relative species abundances across conditions. Furthermore, different omics methods complement each other in their ability to capture functional changes in response to the drug perturbations. For example, while nearly all omics data types captured that the antipsychotic drug chlorpromazine selectively inhibits Bacteroidota representatives in the community, the metatranscriptome and metaproteome suggested that the drug induces stress responses related to protein quality control and metabolomics revealed a decrease in polysaccharide uptake, likely caused by Bacteroidota depletion. Taken together, our study provides insights into how multi-omics datasets can be utilised to reveal complex molecular responses to external perturbations in microbial communities.",

The monocultures were subsequently mixed in equal proportions based on their optical density (OD) and then inoculated in 100 ml of mGAM liquid medium. To allow species to reach a stable state (stabilization phase), the mixed culture was grown for 48 h after which 1 ml was transferred to fresh medium. In total, 3 passages were performed and after the second transfer OD measurements were taken to determine the start of the exponential phase.</p><p><br></p><p>Following the stabilization phase, the mixed community was inoculated in medium prepared with 1 single drug or DMSO (control) as soon as the community reached the exponential phase (OD roughly equal to 2-3). The cultures were subsequently sampled (3 ml) at fixed time intervals (0, 15, 30 min, 1, 3, 48 h), transferred to fresh medium (with drugs or DMSO) after 48 h and then sampled again 48 h later (or 96 h after the start of the experiment).
