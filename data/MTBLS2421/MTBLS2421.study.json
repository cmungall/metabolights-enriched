                "description": "<b>Background:</b> Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is defined as a pervasive developmental disorder which is caused by genetic and environmental risk factors. Besides the core behavioral symptoms, accumulated results indicate children with ASD also share some metabolic abnormalities. <b>Objectives:</b> To analyze the comprehensive metabolic profiles in both of the first-morning urine and plasma samples collected from the same cohort of autistic boys. <b>Methods:</b> In this study, 30 autistic boys and 30 tightly matched healthy control (HC) boys (age range: 2.4~6.7 years) were recruited. First-morning urine and plasma samples were collected and the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was applied to obtain the untargeted metabolic profiles. The acquired data were processed by multivariate analysis and the screened metabolites were grouped by metabolic pathway. <b>Results:</b> Different discriminating metabolites were found in plasma and urine samples. Notably, taurine and catechol levels were decreased in urine but increased in plasma in the same cohort of ASD children. Enriched pathway analysis revealed that perturbations in taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, phenylalanine metabolism, and arginine and proline metabolism could be found in both of the plasma and urine samples. <b>Conclusion:</b> These preliminary results suggest that a series of common metabolic perturbations exist in children with ASD, and confirmed the importance to have a comprehensive analysis of the metabolites in different biological samples to reveal the full picture of the complex metabolic patterns associated with ASD. Further targeted analyses are needed to validate these results in a larger cohort.",

Detailed information on the aims and protocols of the study were explained to the parents or legal guardians of the child participants. Written informed consent was obtained before the involvement of the child participants in the study. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Participants</strong> </p><p><strong>Autistic children</strong> were recruited from autism rehabilitation centers in Beijing, China (mainly from Wucailu Rehabilitation Center). The inclusion criteria for autistic children were: (1) Being diagnosed with autism which was confirmed by experienced psychiatrists according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV-Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR, 2000) criteria. (2) Free of antibiotic treatment, prebiotics and probiotics for at least 4 weeks before sample collection. (3) The children\u2019s primary caregivers had good reading and comprehension skills and were able to fill in the relevant assessment scales. (4) The children\u2019s parents or legal guardians volunteered to participate in this study and signed the informed consent. <strong>Autistic children </strong>with symptoms of other comorbid neurological or psychiatric disorders were excluded from the study. Typically developing children in the <strong>control </strong>group were tightly matched with the ages of the autistic cases, and recruited through advertisements in kindergartens in Beijing. Children in the <strong>control </strong>group were also matched on the antibiotics, prebiotics, and probiotics criteria as well. Children were excluded from the <strong>control </strong>group if they have psychiatric conditions or other potentially confounding medical conditions. Assessment of Autistic Symptom The following scales were used to assess autistic symptoms in autistic and typically developing children: 1. Childhood </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Autism Rating Scale (CARS)</strong></p><p> A 15-item behavior rating scale consists of 14 domains that are generally affected by severe autism, plus one category of general impressions of autism. It is widely used by psychiatrists during diagnosis of autism<strong>[1]</strong>. 2. Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS): A semi-structured, standardized observation tool which is highly recognized as an evaluative measurement for diagnosing ASD. It includes a number of play-based activities designed to accurately assess and diagnose ASD based on the results found across the areas of communication, social interaction, play/imaginative use of materials, and restricted and repetitive behaviors<strong>[2]</strong>. 3. Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R): A standardized comprehensive interview which has proven highly useful for diagnosing autism and planning treatment. It provides categorical results for three domains: qualities of reciprocal social interaction; communication and language; and restricted and repetitive, stereotyped interests and behaviors. Together with the ADOS, it is recognized as the current gold standard of ASD diagnosis worldwide<strong>[3]</strong>. 4. Gesell Developmental Schedules (GDS): A measure of child development which is designed to assess a child\u2019s neurodevelopmental status on the basis of the development quotient (DQ) scores in 4 domains: adaption, motor, language function, and personal/social function<strong>[4]</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Sample Collection </strong></p><p><strong>Blood </strong>samples were collected by trained nurses between 7:00 and 9:30 a.m. Parents were previously informed to have their children fast overnight and allowed only a moderate amount of drinking water to minimize the potential effects of food and water intake. 4 ml of venous <strong>blood </strong>was collected into chilled EDTA tubes containing aprotinin (500 KIU/mL blood). <strong>Blood </strong>samples were centrifuged at 1,600 g for 15 min. <strong>Plasma </strong>was isolated and divided into 500 \u00b5L aliquots. The fresh first morning midstream urine was collected in sterile tubes. The samples were placed on ice and immediately frozen into dry ice and transferred to store at -80 \u00b0C until assay.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1] </strong>Rellini E, Tortolani D, Trillo S, Carbone S, Montecchi F.

Sheath gas and auxiliary gas were set at 45 and 15 arbitrary units. The capillary temperature was 325 \u00b0C. The voltages of the capillary and tube were 35V and 50 V, -15 V and -50 V in positive and negative modes. The Orbitrap analyzer scanned over a mass range of m/z 50-1,000 for full scan at a mass resolution of 60,000. Data dependent acquisition (DDA) MS/MS experiments were performed with the CID scan. The normalized collision energy was 30 eV. Dynamic exclusion was implemented with a repeat count of 2, and exclusion duration of 15s.</p>",
