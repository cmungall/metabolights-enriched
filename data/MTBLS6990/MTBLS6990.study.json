                "description": "<p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> Pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) and lung cancer (LC) have similar clinical symptoms and atypical imaging findings which are easily misdiagnosed. There is an urgent need for a noninvasive, rapid and accurate biomarker for distinguishing LC from TB.</p><p><strong>METHODS:</strong> A total of 694 subjects were enrolled and divided into discovery set (n=122), validation set (n=214) and another validation set (n=358). Metabolites were identified by multivariate and univariate analyses. The random forest (RF) algorithm and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis were used to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of the biomarkers.</p><p><strong>RESULTS:</strong> Seven metabolites were identified and validated. The mean decrease accuracy of phenylalanylphenylalanine ranked first in RF analysis. The area under the curve of phenylalanylphenylalanine was 0.8885 (95% CI 0.8444-0.9326), the sensitivity was 71.43%, and the specificity was 92.13%. Compared with that in NC subjects, the level of phenylalanylphenylalanine was elevated in LC patients (fold change = 2.92, p value &lt; 0.01) and reduced in TB patients (fold change = 0.80, p value &lt; 0.05).</p><p><strong>CONCLUSIONS:</strong> The metabolomic profile of LC and TB was described and a key biomarker, phenylalanylphenylalanine, was identified. We produced a rapid and noninvasive method to supplement existing clinical diagnostic examinations for distinguishing LC from TB.</p>",

Then, the blood samples were separated by centrifugation at 3500 r/min for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C within 2 h Subsequently, the supernatant was removed and divided into 2 mL cryotubes, ensured at least 1 mL in each tube. At last, the serum samples were immediately stored at -80 \u00b0C until metabolomic analysis.</p><p><br></p><p>Equal amount of each serum sample was pipetted into a centrifuge tube to prepare quality control (QC) sample, so as to conduct methodological investigation. The same QC sample made 6 consecutive injections (instrument precision test), 6 QC samples were prepared in parallel and continuously injected for analysis (method precision test), and the same QC sample was injected at 6 timepoints during the whole injection process (sample stability test).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Lewinsohn DM, Leonard MK, LoBue PA, Cohn DL, Daley CL, Desmond E, Keane J, Lewinsohn DA, Loeffler AM, Mazurek GH, O'Brien RJ, Pai M, Richeldi L, Salfinger M, Shinnick TM, Sterling TR, Warshauer DM, Woods GL.

The data obtained included retention time, m/z and normalized peak area. Molecular Weight Tolerance: 0.01 Da. Retention time error: 0.5 min. The data were removed according to the 80% rule, and the missing values were filled by the k-nearest neighbor method.</p><p><br></p><p>The data after preprocessing were imported into <strong>SIMCA-P</strong> (version 14.1, Umetrics, Sweden) for multivariate statistical analysis. Unsupervised principal component analysis (PCA) and supervised partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) models were established to identify potential discriminant variables. PCA was used to remove outlier samples. The discovery set excluded 5 TB samples (t2, t4, t11, t12, t15), 2 LC samples (c2, c18) and 1 NC (k1) sample. The validation set excluded 12 TB samples (T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, T7, T17, T18, T19, T30, T39, T46), 2 LC samples (C5, C6) and 4 NC samples (K9, K39, K48, K54). PLS-DA was used to determine the differential metabolites of different groups. The variable importance in projection (VIP &gt; 1) parameter of the metabolic ion in the PLS-DA model and Student\u2019s t test (<strong>SPSS</strong> 25.0, IBM, US) were used to screen out the differential metabolites (adjusted P value &lt; 0.05) between 2 groups. The P values were adjusted to account by Benjamini-Hochberg method (<strong>BioLadder</strong>, China)<strong>[1]</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p>Pathway enrichment analysis, heatmap and random forest (RF) were performed on <strong>MetaboAnalyst</strong> 5.0<strong>[2]</strong>. RF is an integrated machine learning algorithm, and the function of variable importance analysis was applied<strong>[3]</strong>. The higher the mean decrease accuracy (MDA) is, the greater the contribution to classification. A binary logistic regression model was established for potential biomarkers, and ROC curves were generated based on <strong>SPSS</strong> and <strong>GraphPad Prism</strong> 8.3.0 to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of the biomarkers. To test whether the biomarkers were triggered by interindividual differences, we conducted Spearman analysis (<strong>SPSS</strong> 25.0).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Zhou J, Zhong L.
