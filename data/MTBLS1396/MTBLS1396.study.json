                "description": "<p>The gut microbiome has been implicated in multiple human chronic gastrointestinal (GI) disorders. Determining its mechanistic role in disease has been difficult due to apparent disconnects between animal and human studies and lack of an integrated multi-omics view of disease-specific physiological changes. We integrated longitudinal multi-omics data from the gut microbiome, metabolome, host epigenome, and transcriptome in the context of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) host physiology. We identified IBS subtype-specific and symptom-related variation in microbial composition and function. A subset of identified changes in microbial metabolites correspond to host physiological mechanisms that are relevant to IBS. By integrating multiple data layers, we identified purine metabolism as a novel host-microbial metabolic pathway in IBS with translational potential. Our study highlights the importance of longitudinal sampling and integrating complementary multi-omics data to identify functional mechanisms that can serve as therapeutic targets in a comprehensive treatment strategy for chronic GI diseases.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Linked cross omic data sets:</strong></p><p>Microbiome sequencing data associated with this study are available in the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA): accession number <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJEB37924' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>PRJEB37924</a> and <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA612180' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>PRJNA612180</a>.</p>",

All endoscopic procedures were performed by a single endoscopist (P.C.K.) and up to twelve colonic biopsies were collected using a large-capacity (2.8 mm) biopsy forceps without pin. Depending on downstream processing the biopsies were placed in RNAlater stabilization solution (Life Technologies), directly frozen in liquid nitrogen, or placed in glucose Krebs solution on ice (composition in mM: 11.5 D-glucose, 120.3 NaCl, 15.5 NaHCO3, 5.9 KCl, 1.2 NaH2PO4, 2.5 CaCl2.2H2O, and 1.2 MgCl2; pH 7.3\u20137.4) and immediately transported to the laboratory for experiments.</p><p><br></p><p>Stool specimens were completed via home collection kits at the earliest convenience after the initial visit and then monthly for six months. Sample tubes were returned with frozen gel packs overnight using FedEx or dropped off at the clinical core facility of Mayo Clinic Center for Cell Signaling where samples were stored at -80\u02daC.</p><p><br></p><p>References:</p><p>[1] Bhattarai Y, Williams BB, Battaglioli EJ, Whitaker WR, Till L, Grover M, Linden DR, Akiba Y, Kandimalla KK, Zachos NC, Kaunitz JD, Sonnenburg JL, Fischbach MA, Farrugia G, Kashyap PC.

The plate was then placed on an Eppendorf MixMate plate shaker at 1300 rpm for 5 mins. The reconstituted fecal water and buffer mixture was transferred to 5 mm NMR tubes. NMR buffer with 1.5 M KH2PO4 was prepared by dissolving 20.4 g of KH2PO4 in 80 ml of D2O. D2O (6 ml) containing 100 mg of 3-(trimethylsilyl) propionic-2,2,3,3-d4 acid sodium salt (TSP) (Millipore-Sigma) and 13 mg of NaN3 was added and mixed by shaking and sonication.

Helium was used as the carrier gas at 1 ml/min and injection was made in splitless mode with an injection volume of 1 \u03bcl and an injector temperature of 250 \u00b0C. A glass liner with a glass wool plug at the lower end of the liner was used to avoid the contamination of the GC column with nonvolatile fecal material. Every five faecal samples injected, a blank sample with hexane was inserted to check for memory effects.The column temperature gradient was as follows; start temp 90 \u00b0C, increasing to 150 \u00b0C at 15 \u00b0C/min, 170\u00b0C at 5 \u00b0C/min, 250 \u00b0C at 20 \u00b0C/min, finishing at 250 \u00b0C for 2 min (total time 14 min).
