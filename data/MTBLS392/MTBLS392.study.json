                "description": "<p>The composition and changes of the fungal population and of the metabolites present in grapes and in ferments of Vitis vinifera L. cv. Corvina, one of the major components of the Amarone musts, were dissected aiming at the identification of constant characteristics possibly influenced by the productive process. The fungal populations and metabolomic profiles were analyzed in three different vintages. 454-pyrosequencing on the ribosomal ITS1 region has been used to identify the fungal population present in Corvina grapes and fresh must. Samples were also subjected to metabolomics analysis measuring both free volatile compounds and glycosylated aroma precursors through an untargeted approach with comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Albeit strongly dependent on the climate, both the mycobiota and metabolome of Corvina grapes and fresh musts show some characteristics recursive in different vintages. Such persistent characteristics are likely determined by the method adopted to produce Amarone or other dry wines made from partially dried grapes. In particular, the harsh conditions imposed by the prolonged withering appear to contribute to the shaping of the fungal populations. The fungal genera and metabolites present in different vintages in V. vinifera L. cv. Corvina grapes and fresh musts represent core components of the peculiar technique of production of Amarone. Their identification allows the in-depth understanding and improved control of the process of production of this economically and culturally relevant wine.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Linked cross omic data sets:</strong></p><p>Meta-taxonomics data associated with this study are available in the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA): accession number <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJEB15229' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>PRJEB15229</a>.</p>",

                        "description": "Samples were collected from the warehouse of Cantina Zenato, located in Valpolicella, the Italian viticultural zone located in the province of Verona (Italy), where red wine is typically made from 3 grape varieties: Corvina (V. vinifera L. cv. Corvina), Rondinella, and Molinara. Grapes and musts were sampled during 3 vintages (2013\u20132015). The time of harvesting was decided by the wine-makers according to the evaluated grade of grape maturation. After the harvesting in the vineyard \u201cCostalunga\u201d (also located in the Valpolicella region, Sant'Ambrogio, Verona, Italy), grapes were subjected to withering in a dedicated warehouse located a few kilometers far from the vineyards (<5 Km). The warehouse was equipped with automatic systems able to control and modify the internal temperature and humidity. The duration of grape withering was defined according to the regional rules for Amarone production[1], which defines the time in which the grapes for Amarone vinification can be mashed. In light of this, the withering period varied in the 3 years of study (71 days in 2013, 107 days in 2014, 77 days in 2015). Grapes were then mashed in the warehouse used for the withering and fermentations were carried out in stainless steel tanks. Grapes were collected at 2 time-points during the withering period. The first grape sampling (T0) occurred a few hours after the harvesting, once the grapes were transferred from the vineyard to the warehouse. The second sampling occurred after 7\u20138 weeks since the start of the withering (58th, 49th, and 63rd day after harvesting in the 2013, 2014, and 2015 vintages, respectively). For each time-point of grapes sampling, 6 biological replicates were collected in the 2013 vintage and 8 in the 2014 vintage (a bunch for each replicate). Grapes were mashed at the end of the withering period, namely at the 71st, 107th, and 77th day after harvesting in the 2013, 2014, and 2015 vintages, respectively. Musts samples were collected as soon as the grapes were mashed. To ensure sampling representativity musts were mixed with sterile tools before sampling. In addition, for each sampling equal amounts were sampled from the bottom, from the middle and from the top of the tank, then mixed again and analyzed as an unique sample. 2 must samples were collected in 2013 and 2015 vintages, 8 in 2014. Samples were collected in sterile tubes then stored at \u201380 \u00b0C until extraction.\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Paronetto L., Dellaglio F. (2011).

Free and bound (glycosylated aroma precursors) volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were extracted following the SPE method reported in Vrhovsek et al. (2014). Briefly, the samples were ground under liquid nitrogen using an IKA analytical mill (Staufen, Germany) to obtain a frozen powder and kept in 50 ml Falcon tubes at \u201380 \u00b0C until the analysis. 80 ml of water MilliQ, 0.5 g of gluconolacton and 50 \u00b5l of internal standard n-heptanol (100 mg/l) were added to 30 g of deep frozen sample powder. Homogenisation with ultra-turrax was performed at 21,000 rpm for 3 min and followed by centrifugation at 21,000 rpm at 5 \u00b0C for 5 min. Supernatant was recovered and centrifuged again for 10 min and filtrated through rapid paper filter. The solution was brought to an exact volume of 110 ml with milliQ water. Solid phase extraction was performed using ENV+ cartridges, 1 g (Biotage, Sweden). The cartridge was pre-conditioned with 15 ml methanol followed by 20 ml of water. The aqueous extract was loaded onto the cartridge, which was then washed with 15 ml of water. The free aromatic compounds were eluted from the cartridge with 30 ml dichloromethane and the bound aromatic compounds (i.e. the glycosides) with 30 ml of methanol.  60 ml of pentane was added to the dichloromethane fraction.\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Vrhovsek U., Lotti C., Masuero D., Carlin S., Weingart G., Mattivi F.

A VF-Wax column (100% polyethylene glycol; 30 m x 0.25 mm x 0.25 \u00b5m, Agilent J&W Scientific Inc., Folsom, CA) was used as first-dimension (1D) column, and a Rxi-17Sil MS-column (Restek Bellefonte, USA) (mid polarity phase) 1.50 m x 0.15 mm x 0.15 \u00b5m, (Restek Bellefonte, USA) was used as a second-dimension (2D) column. The GC system was equipped with a secondary column oven and non-moving quadjet dual-stage thermal modulator. The injector/transfer line was maintained at 250 \u00b0C. Oven temperature programme conditions were as follows: initial temperature of 40 \u00b0C for 4 min, programmed at 6 \u00b0C/min at 250 \u00b0C, hold for 5 min. The secondary oven was kept 5 \u00b0C above the primary oven throughout the chromatographic run. The modulator was offset by +15 \u00b0C in relation to the secondary oven; the modulation time was 7 and 1.4 s of hot pulse duration. Helium (99.9995% purity) was used as carrier gas at a constant flow of 1.2 ml/min.",

Free and glycosylated aroma precursors volatile organic compounds were annotated by comparing their mass spectra to NIST 2.0, Wiley 8, and FFNSC 2 libraries, with a similarity match factor of 750. Compounds with a similarity match factor lower than 750 were classified as \u201cunknown\u201d. In the 2014 vintage samples, 93 glycosylated aroma precursors (89 tentatively identified + 4 unknown) and 728 free compounds (664 tentatively identified + 64 unknown) were measured. In the must samples collected in the 2015 vintage 947 free volatile compounds were measured. The response of internal standard 1-heptanol was used for normalization and to make a relative estimation of the identified compounds as commonly accepted in the analysis of aroma compounds. Wilcoxon-Mann-Withney test was carried out to evaluate the significance in the differences abundance of each chemical among either sample types (grapes or musts) or vintages. Pearson coefficients were calculated between chemical compound content and fungal genera relative abundances. All the calculated p-values were adjusted for multiple comparison (FDR)[1].\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Westfall P. H., Young S. S. (1993).
