                "description": "Coral bleaching and coral reef degradation become severe as the surface seawater temperature rises. Much research to date has focused on the bacterial community composition properties within the coral holobiont, but less attention has been paid to the interactions of bacteria and corals under thermal stress. We investigated the changes of coral symbiotic bacteria and metabolites under thermal stress, and analyzed the internal relationship between bacteria and metabolites as well as their relationship with coral health. We found obvious signs of coral bleaching after heating treatment, and the interaction within symbiotic bacterial community became closer. The coral symbiotic bacterial community and metabolites changed significantly under thermal stress, and bacteria such as Flavobacterium, Shewanella and Psychrobacter increased significantly. Bacteria associated with stress tolerance, biofilm formation and mobile elements decreased, and bacterial DMSP metabolism increased slightly after heating treatment. Differential metabolites in corals after heating treatment were associated with cell cycle regulation and antioxidant. This study revealed the correlation between differential metabolites and bacterial community composition changes in corals under thermal stress, and providing valuable insight on metabolomics research of corals.",

In total 2 <em>A. digitifera</em> colonies were acclimatized in each aquarium for 2 months at a water temperature of 25 \u00b0C, and all the culture waters were circulated through the entire system. The original seawater in the tank was taken from collection site and was replaced with a constant water flow at a rate of ~1/4 tank per day. All the twelve coral colonies were splited from the same coral. At the beginning of the heating experiment, all the 6 aquariums were separated into individuals. Then 3 aquariums (Heating group) were heated to 32 \u00b0C using 100 W heaters (Atman, China) and the other 3 aquariums (Control group) were maintained at 25 \u00b0C.</p><p><br></p><p>One fragment (~3 g) from each coral colony in each aquarium was taken at the beginning (6 samples for each group) and end (Day 13, 6 samples for each group) of the expriment for a total of 24 samples were obtained.

Liquid nitrogen were added into the mortar to maintain cryogenic condition during the grounding process.

The sample injection volume was 10 \u00b5L and the flow rate was set to 0.4 mL/min. The column temperature was maintained at 40 \u00b0C. During the period of analysis, all these samples were stored at 4 \u00b0C.</p>",
