                "description": "<p><strong>AIMS:</strong> Although studies have made the connection between lipid metabolism disorder and osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH), the characteristics of the circulating lipidome signature of ONFH have not yet been investigated yet and need to be explored.</p><p><strong>METHODS:</strong> We conducted a comprehensive analysis of plasma lipidomics in a clinical human cohort including 32 healthy normal control (NC) subjects and 91 ONFH patients in different subgroups (alcohol-induced [AONFH], steroid-induced, and traumatic ONFH) and stages (stages I/II, stages III/IV), using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry.</p><p><strong>RESULTS:</strong> The PLS-DA model indicates that the global plasma lipidome profile differs between the ONFH and NC samples. We identified a signature including 22 common differentially expressed lipids (DELs) in all the three subgroups (VIP &gt; 1, P &lt; 0.05, FC &gt; 1.5 or FC &lt; 0.67, compared with the NC group), and for each of the subtype-specific lipidome profiles, as well as altered lipid biomarkers (FC &gt; 2, P &lt; 0.05, and AUC &gt; 0.7, compared with the NC group) for each subgroup. The AONFH subgroup has the most DELs, and the plasma levels of lipid compounds in the subclass of triacylglycerol increased obviously in the AONFH samples. We identified that 9 stage-positive and 2 stage-negative lipids may function as novel biomarkers that predict the disease progression of ONFH.</p><p><strong>CONCLUSION:</strong> This study provides the first overview, analysis, and understanding of the unique phenotype-related plasma lipidome signature of ONFH. The results will offer insights into the mechanisms underlying lipid metabolism in the pathogenesis and progression of ONFH, and will help to identify novel lipids biomarkers or targets for disease diagnosis and treatment.</p>",

We excluded patients who had other chronic diseases, including chronic heart disease, diabetes, liver disease, and kidney disease. Finally, a total of 123 participants including 91 cases of <strong>ONFH </strong>and 32 cases of <strong>NC </strong>participants, were screened and included in the study. We then collected blood samples from all 123 participants for further&nbsp;lipidomics detection. The 91 subjects with <strong>ONFH </strong>were further divided into 2 groups: the <strong>TONFH </strong>group (n=46) and <strong>NONFH </strong>group (n=45), the latter contained the <strong>AONFH </strong>subgroup (n=16) and the <strong>SONFH </strong>subgroup (n=29). As for <strong>AONFH</strong>, patient has a history of drinking &gt;10 years, the weekly drinking intake is greater than 400 mL, and there is still a history of drinking before joint replacement. As for <strong>SONFH</strong>, patient has a history of short-term high-dose hormone application before the occurrence of femoral head necrosis, except for those with autoimmune diseases who have been taking hormones for a long time. Overall, 26 out of the 91 <strong>ONFH </strong>patients had <strong>stage I</strong> or <strong>stage II</strong> disease, while 65 patients had <strong>stage III</strong> or <strong>stage IV </strong>disease. <strong>Fig. 1 </strong>in the paper associated with this study illustrates the demographics of the study population. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Honghui Hospital, Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University (No. 202005002), and was supported by the project \u201cScreening and verification of metabolic biomarkers in peripheral blood of patients with femoral head necrosis\u201d registered at <a href='www.chictr.org.cn' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>www.chictr.org.cn</a> as ChiCTR2000033442 .</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Blood sample collection and preparation:</strong></p><p><strong>Plasma </strong>samples were collected from all 123 participants. Fasting <strong>blood </strong>samples were collected in tubes containing the anticoagulant ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid (EDTA).

After 10 min of incubation at room temperature, the sample was centrifuged at 1,000 g for 10 min. The upper (organic) phase was collected, and the lower phase was re-extracted with 1 mL of the solvent mixture (MTBE/methanol/water [10:3:2.5, v/v/v]). The combined organic phases were dried and dissolved in 100 \u03bcL of isopropanol for storage and then analyzed by LC-MS/MS.</p>",

The main parameters were set as follows: retention time tolerance, 0.2 min; actual mass tolerance, 5 ppm; signal intensity tolerance, 30%; signal/noise ratio, 3; and minimum intensity, 100,000. After that, the peak intensities were normalized to the total spectral intensity. The normalized data were used to predict the molecular formula based on additive ions, molecular ion peaks, and fragment ions. Then, the peaks were matched with the <strong>LipidMaps[1]</strong>, <strong>LipidBlast[2]</strong>, and <strong>HMDB database[3]</strong> to obtained accurate qualitative and relative quantitative results.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Bioinformatics and statistical analysis </strong></p><p>Statistical analysis and diagram drawing were performed using statistical software <strong>R </strong>(R version <strong>R-3.4.3</strong>), <strong>Prism </strong>(version<strong> 8.4.3</strong>), <strong>MedCalc </strong>(version <strong>18.2.1</strong>), and <strong>Circos </strong>(<strong>circos-0.69-9</strong>). Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS\u2010 DA) based on lipidomics data was performed using the \u201c<strong>plsda </strong>()\u201d algorithm from the \u201c<strong>mixOmics</strong>\u201d package on the <strong>R </strong>platform. The univariate analysis (t-test) was used to calculate statistical significance (P-value). Metabolites with variable importance in projection (VIP) &gt;1, P-value &lt;0.05, and fold change (FC) \u22651.50 or FC \u22640.67 were considered as differential metabolites. The \u201c<strong>Pheatmap</strong>\u201d package on the <strong>R </strong>platform was used to create clustering heat maps based on the relative intensity of the metabolites. The <strong>MedCalc </strong>statistical software was used for the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, with P &lt;0.05 as the statistical significance level. Candidate metabolites with an area under curve (AUC) &gt;0.7 have been identified as effective discriminators between different groups. The public repository, <strong>PubChem </strong>(<a href='http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>), was consulted to explore biomolecular interactions or other related information on specific lipid compounds.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Fahy E, Alvarez-Jarreta J, Brasher CJ, Nguyen A, Hawksworth JI, Rodrigues P, Meckelmann S, Allen SM, O'Donnell VB.
