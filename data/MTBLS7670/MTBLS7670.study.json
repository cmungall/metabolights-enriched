                "description": "<p>The human gut microbiome establishes and matures during infancy, and dysregulation at this stage may lead to pathologies later in life. We conducted a multi-omics study comprising three generations of family members to investigate the early development of the gut microbiota. Fecal samples from 200 individuals, including infants (0-12 months old; 55% females, 45% males) and their respective mothers and grandmothers, were analyzed using two independent metabolomics platforms and metagenomics. For metabolomics, gas chromatography and capillary electrophoresis \u2013 using multisegment injection \u2013 coupled to mass spectrometry were applied. For metagenomics, both 16S rRNA gene and shotgun sequencing were performed. Here we show that infants greatly vary from their elders in fecal microbiota populations, function, and metabolome. Infants have a less diverse microbiota than adults and present differences in several metabolite classes, such as short- and branched-chain fatty acids, which are associated with shifts in bacterial populations. These findings provide innovative biochemical insights into the shaping of the gut microbiome within the same generational line that could be beneficial in improving childhood health outcomes.</p>",

Briefly, feces samples were lyophilized overnight at -110 \u00b0C in a LyoQest -85 lyophilizer (Telstar) until completely dried. Then, the lyophilizate from each individual was homogenized mechanically. Samples were taken as quickly as possible from the -80 \u00b0C freezer to avoid any thawing that would interfere with the lyophilization.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong style='color: rgb(54, 54, 54);'>Extraction of samples for GC-QTOF-MS analysis</strong></p><p>10 mg of lyophilized feces were mixed with <strong>300 \u03bcL of NaOH (1M)</strong> solution in Milli-Q water and <strong>10 \u03bcL of 1000 ppm 4-methyl valeric acid (4MV) solution</strong> <strong>(IS1)</strong>, in a 0.5 mL Eppendorf tube and vortexed vigorously for 2 min. Samples were then centrifuged at 16,000 rcf at 4 \u00b0C for 20 min. 200 \u03bcL of supernatant was transferred into an autosampler vial, and the residue was further extracted with <strong>200 \u03bcL of cold methanol</strong>. After repeating the homogenization and centrifugation as above, 167 \u03bcL of supernatant was combined with the first supernatant in the sample vial. Blank samples were prepared in the same way, omitting the 10 mg of lyophilizate. To derivatize the extracted metabolites, <strong>20 \u03bcL of MCF</strong> were added to each vial, as well as <strong>34 \u03bcL of pyridine</strong>. The samples were then vortexed vigorously for exactly 30 s. Another <strong>20 \u03bcL of MCF</strong> were added again, and samples were vortexed for another 30 s. Subsequently, <strong>400 \u03bcL of 20 ppm tricosane (TRI) solution in chloroform (IS2) </strong>were added. Samples were vortexed for 30 s, followed by an addition of<strong> 400 \u03bcL of sodium bicarbonate solution (NaHCO3, 50 mM in Milli-Q water)</strong> and additional vortexing for 30 s. Samples were then centrifuged at 2000 rcf for 20 min at 4 \u00b0C in order to clearly visualize the double meniscus. Finally, 350 \u03bcL of the bottom chloroformic phase were transferred to transparent GC vials containing <strong>\u223c100 mg of anhydrous sodium sulfate (Na2SO4)</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p>To be able to measure reliably all the samples from our cohort we divided them into three batches, according to the age group: batch 1) Mothers; batch 2) Grandmothers; and batch 3) Infants. The samples were randomly measured inside their batch. We decided to begin with the batch with the most sample quantity (Mothers), then Grandmothers, and finally the batch where sample quantity was limited (Infants), to assure that the analysts had enough experience and skill when analyzing the most valuable samples. To later be able to join these batches and compare the data between them, we devised a <strong>quality control (QC) strategy</strong>. To prepare the <strong>QC</strong> samples, 17 mg of 30 lyophilized samples were taken (10 random samples from each of the 3 age groups) and a <strong>pool of 510 mg</strong> was obtained. This pool was split in three parts, one for each batch (<strong>170 mg per batch</strong>). <strong>Inside each batch, 11 QC samples were prepared</strong>, by taking <strong>10 mg of the lyophilized faeces</strong> and following the same protocol as the samples. From these 11 QCs, 3 were used as equilibrium QCs at the start of the analysis (by injecting them 5 times), and the other 8 were placed in the worklist every 9-10 samples \u2013 whose order was randomized inside each batch. This assured that the batches could be joined later by using a normalization strategy.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Extraction of samples for MSI-CE-TOF-MS analysis</strong></p><p>Fecal extracts were prepared by taking 25 mg of feces lyophilizate and extracting with <strong>1 mL of H2O:ACN:IPA (10:6:5)</strong>. This extract was filtered through Micro centrifuge filters (0.45 \u03bcm Nylon, Costar) at 16,100 x g for 15 min at 4 \u00b0C. For this extract to be suitable for MSI-CE-TOF-MS analysis, 100 \u03bcl aliquots of each sample were dried in a N2 evaporator and reconstituted with <strong>50 \u03bcl of H2O:Methanol (70:30)</strong>, containing the corresponding internal standard (<strong>IS</strong>) \u2013 <strong>40 \u03bcM chloro-tyrosine (Cl-Tyr)</strong> as the <strong>IS for positive mode</strong> and <strong>1 mM 2-Naphthalene-sulfonic acid (NMS)</strong> as the<strong> IS for negative mode</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>MSI-CE-TOF-MS</strong> <strong>QC samples</strong> were prepared by pooling 5 \u03bcl of each sample in the study to a \u201cGrand Pool\u201d, from which 6 50 \u03bcl aliquots were prepared by the same protocol as the rest of the samples. These QC samples were measured throughout the run to monitor analytical variability and equipment performance.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1] </strong>Linjing Zhao, L., Ni, Y., Su, M., Li, H., Dong, F., Chen, W., Wei, R., Zhang, L., Guiraud, S.

                        "description": "<p>The data treatment procedure was adapted from recently published protocols that have been rigorously tested and fine-tuned at <strong>CEMBIO[1]</strong>. <strong>GC-QTOF-MS</strong> data, peak detection and spectra processing algorithms were applied using <strong>MassHunter Software (Agilent Technologies)</strong>. The overall analytical performance was carefully examined by inspection of total ion chromatograms (TIC) of experimental samples, QC samples, blanks, and both internal standards (IS): 4MV and TRI. 4MV is the IS1 that is added before the derivatization and thus controls the reproducibility of the whole sample preparation process, while TRI is the IS2, added after the derivatization, and is used to control mostly the analytical performance of the <strong>GC-QTOF-MS</strong> equipment (drifts in response and performance of the injection process). The data files were then introduced into <strong>MassHunter Unknowns Analysis (B.10.0, Agilent)</strong> and the <strong>SureMass (Agilent Technologies)</strong> mass spectral deconvolution algorithm \u2013 specifically designed to work with accurate mass \u2013 was applied to identify co-eluted compounds. The algorithm reconstructs a pure mass spectrum for the components that the mass spectrometer observes according to their RTs. In a next step, the program matched these deconvoluted mass spectra together with the RTs to spectral libraries to assign an identification. We used a \u201cPersonal Compound Database and Library\u201d (PCDL) built by analyzing chemical standards with the same method, and thus includes accurate mass in all detected m/z (mass-to-charge) fragments. Then, we performed a further search into the NIST20 library (National Institute of Standards and Technology, U.S. Department of Commerce), which includes only spectra of nominal mass. The details and parameters of these analyses are described in detail elsewhere<strong>[1]</strong>. After the deconvolution and library search, a <strong>CEF </strong>file<strong> </strong>was created for each sample with the hits with the highest match. Next, these <strong>CEF</strong> files were imported into <strong>Mass Profiler Professional (Agilent) </strong>to generate an alignment of all the different hits of all the samples. This alignment generated a <strong>CEF</strong> file for all samples that gathered all the compounds that were later quantified.</p><p><br></p><p>For obtaining the abundances of the metabolites, <strong>MassHunter Quantitative (B.10.0, Agilent) </strong>was used. First, the targeted ions selected from the corresponding spectrum of the library were carefully checked with the experimental data, avoiding saturated ions and discarding compounds derived from the solvents, derivatizing agents or column bleeding. This process allowed the better revision of compound annotation, which was performed by comparing mass fragmentation patterns with the <strong>NIST20 library</strong> using <strong>MassHunter Qualitative (B.08.00, Agilent) </strong>and the <strong>NIST MS Search v.2.4</strong> tool. To enhance annotation confidence, the RI of the features were calculated by interpolating their experimental RT into calibration files built with the n-alkanes mix measured at the beginning of every batch. The experimental RI were then matched with the values in the <strong>NIST20 library</strong>. Then, the integration method was applied, and peak areas were carefully checked and corrected manually if necessary for all compounds in samples, blanks and QCs. The result of these processes was an Excel file for each batch (Infants, Mothers, and Grandmothers) containing all the features integrated in the corresponding samples.</p><p><br></p><p>The following step was a blank subtraction, where the mean abundance of each metabolite in the blank samples was calculated and subtracted from the abundance of that metabolite in each sample. This process ensured that signals from the reagents, solvents, contaminants and derivatizing agents were removed. Then, a <strong>Quality Assurance procedure (QA)</strong> was performed<strong>[2][3]</strong>. First, we applied a filter by presence, where features that appeared in &lt;50% of QCs and &lt;70% of samples were removed. Then, we applied a filter by <strong>Relative Standard Deviation</strong> (RSD, also known as coefficient of variation, CV), where metabolites were kept if they had, in at least one batch, an RSD&lt;30% in the QC samples. All the above processes were performed independently for each batch. <strong>Normalization procedures</strong> were also carried out to ensure the comparison between the three batches. First, <strong>an intra-batch correction using \u201cQC Sample \u2013 Support Vector Regression Correction\u201d (QC-SVRC)[4]</strong>, and after the fusion of the three batches in a unique Excel, an <strong>inter-batch correction with QC-Norm[5][6]</strong> were applied. After these normalizations, the QA filters were carried out in the same way as before.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Rey-Stolle, F. et al.

As described before in detail, the identification of metabolites was performed using <strong>SureMass mass spectral deconvolution algorithm</strong> to identify co-eluted compounds and reconstruct a pure mass spectrum. These deconvoluted mass spectra were matched with the <strong>RTs</strong> of spectral libraries to assign an identification. A \u201c<strong>Personal Compound Database and Library\u201d (PCDL)</strong> which was built by analyzing chemical standards with the same method, and thus includes accurate mass in all detected m/z (mass-to-charge) fragments, was used. Then, we performed a further search into the <strong>NIST20 library (National Institute of Standards and Technology, U.S. Department of Commerce)</strong>, which includes only spectra of nominal mass. After this, manual revision of compound annotation was performed, by comparing mass fragmentation patterns with the <strong>NIST20 library</strong> using <strong>MassHunter Qualitative (B.08.00, Agilent)</strong> and the <strong>NIST MS Search v.2.4 tool</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>MSI-CE-TOF-MS - Targeted search of metabolites using in-house library </strong></p><p>Once the data were obtained, they were processed following the procedures detailed previously<strong>[2]</strong>. We selected 14 known metabolites and performed a targeted search to obtain their relative responses. Of these, 6 were in common with GC-QTOF-MS to check the accordance between both techniques, while the other 8 were crucial metabolites that had not been previously detected (see <span style='color: rgb(54, 54, 54); font-style: normal; font-weight: 700;'>Figure S4B</span> in the paper associated with this study). The metabolite selection was based on a literature search for relevant metabolites, the filtering of metabolites already detected by GC-MS and the quality (peak shape and dilution pattern) of the extracted ion electropherograms in the QCs. The QA procedures and statistical analyses were applied in the same way as for the GC-QTOF-MS data. Of note, GABA was not detected in all samples (total n= 160) due to isomeric interferences. Thus, a K-nearest neighbors (KNN) missing value imputation was carried out with a MATLAB script<strong style='font-style: inherit;'>[3]</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong>Rey-Stolle, F., Dudzik, D., Gonzalez-Riano, C., Fern\u00e1ndez-Garc\u00eda, M., Alonso-Herranz, V., Rojo, D., Barbas, C., Garc\u00eda, A. 2022.
