                "description": "Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has a lifelong latency period after initial infection. Rarely, however, when the EBV immediate early gene BZLF1 is expressed by a specific stimulus, the virus switches to the lytic cycle to produce progeny viruses. We found that EBV infection reduced levels of various ceramide species in gastric cancer cells. As ceramide is a bioactive lipid implicated in the infection of various viruses, we assessed the effect of ceramide on the EBV lytic cycle. Treatment with C6-ceramide (C6-Cer) induced an increase in the endogenous ceramide pool and increased production of the viral product as well as BZLF1 expression. Treatment with the ceramidase inhibitor ceranib-2 induced EBV lytic replication with an increase in the endogenous ceramide pool. The glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor Genz-123346 inhibited C6-Cer-induced lytic replication. C6-Cer induced ERK1/2 and CREB phosphorylation, c-JUN expression, and accumulation of the autophagosome marker LC3B. Treatment with MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 or autophagy initiation inhibitor 3-MA suppressed C6-Cer-induced EBV lytic replication. In contrast, the autophagosome-lysosome fusion inhibitor chloroquine induced BZLF1 expression. Transfection with siCREB reduced ERK1/2 phosphorylation and C6-Cer-induced BZLF1 expression. On the other hand, siJUN transfection did not affect BZLF1 expression. Our results show that increased endogenous ceramide and glycosyl ceramide (GlyCer) following C6-Cer treatment induce EBV lytic replication in gastric cancer cells via ERK1/2 and CREB phosphorylation and autophagosome accumulation.",

In between homogenization, the samples were cooled for 2 min on dry ice to prevent lipid deformation. An extraction solvent (850 \u03bcl of -20 \u00b0C MTBE) was added, and after being vortexed for 1 min, the samples were extracted on a ThermoShaker for 1 h at 1,500 rpm and 4 \u00b0C. For the next step, 210 \u03bcl of water at 4 \u00b0C was added followed by 1 min vortexing and 15 min shaking at 1,500 rpm. Finally, the samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 16,000 x g, and 800 \u03bcl of the upper layer was transferred into separate tubes. After being completely dried under a gentle stream of nitrogen gas, the samples were stored at -80 \u00b0C until analysis. For resuspension, dried samples were reconstituted with 70 \u03bcl of methanol:toluene (9:1, v/v) and a quality control (QC) sample was prepared by pooling the same volume of each sample together.</p>",
