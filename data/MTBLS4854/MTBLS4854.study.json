                "description": "The integration of cell metabolism with signalling pathways, transcription factor networks and epigenetic mediators is critical in coordinating molecular and cellular events during embryogenesis. Induced pluripotent stem cells (IPSCs) are an established model for embryogenesis, germ layer specification and cell lineage differentiation, advancing the study of human embryonic development and the translation of innovations in drug discovery, disease modelling and cell-based therapies. The metabolic regulation of IPSC pluripotency is mediated by balancing glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, but there is a paucity of data regarding the influence of individual metabolite changes during cell lineage differentiation. We used <sup>1</sup>H NMR metabolite fingerprinting and footprinting to monitor metabolite levels as IPSCs are directed in a three-stage protocol through primitive streak/mesendoderm, mesoderm and chondrogenic populations. Metabolite changes were associated with central metabolism, with aerobic glycolysis predominant in IPSC, elevated oxidative phosphorylation during differentiation and fatty acid oxidation and ketone body use in chondrogenic cells. Metabolites were also implicated in the epigenetic regulation of pluripotency, cell signalling and biosynthetic pathways. Our results show that <sup>1</sup>H NMR metabolomics is an effective tool for monitoring metabolite changes during the differentiation of pluripotent cells with implications on optimising media and environmental parameters for the study of embryogenesis and translational applications.",

Detailed protocols describing the recovery, maintenance and cryopreservation of the UKKi26a IPSC line have been previously described<strong>[1]</strong>. UKKi026a was maintained by culture on vitronectin substrate (0.5 \u00b5g/cm^2, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Warrington, UK) in Stemflex culture medium (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific) in a humidified cell culture incubator at 37 00B0C, 5% CO2, 5% O2.

The protocol for DD is described in Table S8 of the paper associated with this study. Cells were cultured on defined matrix substrates in a basal medium (DMEM:F12, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1% (v/v) ITS, 1% (v/v) nonessential amino acids, 2% (v/v) B27, 90 \u03bcM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol; all reagents from Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific) temporally supplemented with growth factor combinations. Medium changes were performed every 24 h as outlined. Gelatin was purchased from Sigma, Poole, UK. All growth factors were purchased from R&amp;D Systems.</p><p><br></p><p>Differentiating cultures were harvested for 1H NMR metabolomic analysis at <strong>day 0 (pluripotent cells)</strong>, <strong>day 4 (Stage 1, equivalent to mesendoderm)</strong>, <strong>day 11 (Stage 2, mesoderm)</strong> and <strong>day 17 (Stage 3, chondrogenic cells)</strong>.

Custom pattern files for the cell and media extracts were generated by adjusting individual ppm peak boundaries for each annotation. Resultant pattern files were uploaded alongside their representative spectra and subject to spectral bucketing using <strong>tameNMR</strong>. Cell extract spectra were integrated into 165 bins, of which 95 (57.57%) of annotations represented the 56 known unique metabolites. For EBs where signal to noise was less favourable the methyl-containing metabolites were annotated leading to a reduced number of representative metabolites (n=12) and bins (n=28). Media spectra yielded 167 total bins, with 138 (82.63%) of the annotations including 41 unique metabolites. For cell and media spectra, 46 and 31 bins were annotated as including unknown metabolites, respectively. Where multiple bins were annotated with a single metabolite, an in-house <strong>correlation scoring metric (CRS)</strong> script was applied to select the most representative bin for each metabolite for use in further analyses<strong>[1]</strong>. Where correlation scores were low between bins or scores were tied, bins were manually examined to determine the most representative bin. Factors in the selection process included signal-to-noise ratio, presence of overlapping spectra and the <strong>Chenomx</strong> visualisation of relevant bins.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Grosman R.
