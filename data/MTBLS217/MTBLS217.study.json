                "description": "The interplay between the Apicomplexan parasite Toxoplasma gondii and its host has been largely studied. However, molecular changes at the metabolic level in the host central nervous system and pathogenesis-associated metabolites during brain infection are largely unexplored. We used a global metabolomics strategy to identify differentially regulated metabolites and affected metabolic pathways in BALB/c mice during infection with T. gondii Pru strain at 7, 14 and 21 days post-infection (DPI). The non-targeted Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) metabolomics analysis detected approximately 2,755 retention time-exact mass pairs, of which more than 60 had significantly differential profiles at different stages of infection. These include amino acids, organic acids, carbohydrates, fatty acids, and vitamins. The biological significance of these metabolites is discussed. Principal Component Analysis and Orthogonal Partial Least Square-Discriminant Analysis showed the metabolites\u2019 profile to change over time with the most significant changes occurring at 14 DPI. Correlated metabolic pathway imbalances were observed in carbohydrate metabolism, lipid metabolism, energetic metabolism and fatty acid oxidation. Eight metabolites correlated with the physical recovery from infection-caused illness were identified. These findings indicate that global metabolomics adopted in this study is a sensitive approach for detecting metabolic alterations in T. gondii-infected mice and generated a comparative metabolic profile of brain tissue distinguishing infected from non-infected host.",

Peak picking, peak grouping and retention time correction were all involved in data pre-treatment, which were done through the XCMS software that was implemented with the freely available R statistical language (v 2.13.1).\n</p>\nThe retention time (RT)-m/z data pairs were used to indentify ion intensities of those detected peaks. The consistent variables (ion intensity information) were obtained by filtering peaks with 80 % missing values. In order to remove the offsets and adjust the importance of high and low abundance metabolites to an equal level, the data was preprocessed by both mean-centering and variance-scaling prior to multivariate analysis. Then, the resulting three-dimensional matrix that includes assigned peak indices (retention time-m/z pairs), sample names and variables further went through the multivariate data analysis.",

A specific metabolite was sieved out when a match with a difference between observed and theoretical mass was less than 10 ppm. Then the metabolite molecular formula of matched metabolites was further identified by the isotopic distribution measurement.",
