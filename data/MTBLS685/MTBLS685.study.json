                "description": "<p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> Large-scale, placebo-controlled trials established that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs confer a cardiovascular hazard: this has been attributed to depression of cardioprotective products of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, especially prostacyclin. An alternative mechanism by which nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs might constrain cardioprotection is by enhancing the formation of methylarginines in the kidney that would limit the action of nitric oxide throughout the vasculature.</p><p><strong>METHODS:</strong> Targeted and untargeted metabolomics were used to investigate the effect of COX-2 deletion or inhibition in mice and in osteoarthritis patients exposed to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on the l-arginine/nitric oxide pathway.</p><p><strong>RESULTS:</strong> Analysis of the plasma and renal metabolome was performed in postnatal tamoxifen-inducible Cox-2 knockout mice, which exhibit normal renal function and blood pressure. This revealed no changes in arginine and methylarginines compared with their wild-type controls. Moreover, the expression of genes in the l-arginine/nitric oxide pathway was not altered in the renal medulla or cortex of tamoxifen inducible Cox-2 knockout mice. Therapeutic concentrations of the selective COX-2 inhibitors, rofecoxib, celecoxib, and parecoxib, none of which altered basal blood pressure or renal function as reflected by plasma creatinine, failed to elevate plasma arginine and methylarginines in mice. Finally, plasma arginine or methylarginines were not altered in osteoarthritis patients with confirmed exposure to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs that inhibit COX-1 and COX-2. By contrast, plasma asymmetrical dimethylarginine was increased in mice infused with angiotensin II sufficient to elevate blood pressure and impair renal function. Four weeks later, blood pressure, plasma creatinine, and asymmetrical dimethylarginine were restored to normal levels. The increase in asymmetrical dimethylarginine in response to infusion with angiotensin II in celecoxib-treated mice was also related to transient impairment of renal function.</p><p><strong>CONCLUSIONS:</strong> Plasma methylarginines are not altered by COX-2 deletion or inhibition but rather are elevated coincident with renal compromise.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Murine and human plasma quantitative L-arginine and methylarginines UPLC-MS/MS assay</strong> protocols and data are reported in the current study <strong>MTBLS685</strong>.</p><p><strong>Murine kidney and plasma UPLC-MS/MS assay</strong> protocols and data are reported in <a href=\"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS680\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>MTBLS680</strong></a>.</p>",

                        "description": "All animal studies were performed in accordance with the guidelines approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the University of Pennsylvania. All mice were on a C57/BL6 background unless otherwise specified. Male mice, 8 to 20 weeks of age, were used for all experiments. Tamoxifen-inducible Cox-2 KO (ind.Cox-2 KO) mice and their littermate controls (wild-type [WT]) were generated as previously reported[1]. Hyperlipidemic vascular Cox-2 KO (vascular smooth muscle cell [VSMC]/EC Cox-2 Ldlr KO) mice and their control (Ldlr KO) mice were generated as previously reported[2]. Ip KO mice[3] were bred in a homozygous manner, and C57/BL6 mice were used as controls. All animals were fed ad libitum with regular chow diet, unless specified, for the course of study. Mice were kept under a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle.\n</br></br>\nInd.Cox-2 KO Study:</br>\nSystolic blood pressure was measured in conscious 16-week-old ind.Cox-2 KO mice and WT by a tail-cuff system. Blood was collected from the vena cava, and then plasma was analyzed for L-arginine, methylarginines, and creatinine levels.\n</br></br>\nCelecoxib and Rofecoxib Study:</br>\nTwelve-week-old C57/BL6 mice started receiving a diet containing celecoxib (100 mg/kg body weight [BW] per day) or rofecoxib (50 mg/kg BW per day) for 8 weeks. Celecoxib and rofecoxib were obtained from Sequoia Research Products. Drug-containing diets were prepared by Teklad laboratory. Systolic blood pressure was measured in conscious mice at the end of the study by a tail-cuff system. Blood was collected from the vena cava and, after centrifugation, plasma was analyzed for L-arginine, methylarginines, and creatinine levels by mass spectrometry.\n</br></br>\nAng II Study:</br>\nInd.Cox-2 KO, WT, and C57/BL6 mice (on a control diet or a celecoxib diet for 3 weeks) at 12 to 14 weeks of age received Ang II (1500 \u03bcg/kg per day, Calbiochem, Darmstadt, Germany) in saline by continuous infusion for 2 weeks. The celecoxib diet was continued during the Ang II infusion but not during the washout period. Ang II was administered subcutaneously via Alzet osmotic minipumps (model 2002) as described previously[4]. In ind.Cox-2 KO mice and WTs, systolic blood pressure was measured in conscious mice at baseline (before Ang II administration) and at the end of the study (2 weeks after starting Ang II infusion) with a computerized non-invasive tail-cuff system and calculated as described previously[5]. In C57/BL6 mice on a control or celecoxib diet, systolic blood pressure was measured at baseline, 2 weeks after starting the Ang II infusion, and 4 weeks after the end of the Ang II infusion using a tail-cuff system. Plasma was analyzed for L-arginine, methylarginines, and creatinine levels by mass spectrometry.\n</br></br>\nParecoxib Study:</br>\n12- to 14-week-old C57/BL6 mice received parecoxib sodium (100 mg/kg; Sequoia Research Products) in drinking water for 4 days as previously reported[6]. Systolic blood\npressure was measured in conscious mice at baseline (before starting parecoxib administration) and at the end of the study by radiotelemetry. Plasma was analyzed for L-arginine, methylarginines, and creatinine levels by mass spectrometry.\n</br></br>\nIp KO Study:</br>\nBlood was collected from the vena cava from 8- to 10-week-old Ip KO mice and WT. Plasma samples were analyzed for L-arginine, methylarginines, and creatinine levels by mass spectrometry.\n</br></br>\nHuman Subjects:</br>\nPeripheral blood from donors with osteoarthritis was obtained through the Partners HealthCare Biobank, a repository of serum and plasma samples from patients who consented to link their medical records with samples for research purposes, at Partners HealthCare (Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital), according to institutional review board\u2013approved protocols. We identified patients with osteoarthritis by filtering for those with osteoarthritis billing codes and plain radiographs of the hips or knees. To reduce the potential for confounding by other comorbidities, we excluded patients with any billing codes for diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, cancer, or coronary artery disease. Among this set, we used natural language processing techniques in the clinical notes to identify patients who were never smokers. We restricted the sample to those who were not obese. Among this set, we identified NSAID users by prescription queries (n=174) and those who never received any NSAID prescription. We performed directed chart review to identify patients with strong evidence of a prescription NSAID around the date of blood draw (n=51). NSAID exposure was confirmed by mass spectrometry assays in these samples (n=31). Some of them (n=16) presented therapeutic levels of NSAIDs and were used as NSAID case status. Controls were defined using electronic health record data restricted to the 12 months before blood draw as (1) osteoarthritis patients without any NSAID prescription and (2) with no evidence of text mention of NSAIDs using natural language processing. Controls (n=97) had mass spectrometry assays performed, and those who had no NSAID detectable were considered controls for analyses (n=16).\n</br></br>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Yu Z, Crichton I, Tang SY, Hui Y, Ricciotti E, Levin MD, Lawson JA, Pur\u00e9 E, FitzGerald GA.
