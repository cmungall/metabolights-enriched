                "description": "While most parasites primarily reproduce asexually, they can transition to sexual reproduction to promote genetic diversity and maintain their infectiousness. Nonetheless, documentation of sexual reproduction is seldom observed in most parasitic species. In this study, we demonstrate the existence of specialized spores dedicated to sexual reproduction in the marine protist parasite Amoebophrya, which parasitizes planktonic dinoflagellates. These sexual spores exhibit distinct characteristics compared to infective spores, including larger size, unique swimming behavior, shorter lifespan, distinct metabolite production, and an inability to infect a new host. Transcriptome analysis of these spores, isolated through cytometry, reveals a significant expression of genes associated with meiosis and DNA replication, highlighting their involvement in sexual reproduction. The production of these sexual spores exhibits intergenerational variability and remains unaffected by host populations, including factors such as density, age, and the initial host-parasite ratio. Strikingly, a given infected host cell generates one of the two spore types, indicating a predetermined mechanism that is activated before release from the host. Through implementing a decision-support hierarchical model, we identify the density of infective spores before infection, both within the culture prepared for the inoculum (n-1 generation) and within the inoculum itself, as critical explanatory variables for understanding sexual spore production. We suggest that a density-dependent signal, operating among infective free-living spores of one generation, may induce sexual reproduction during the host infection, producing sexual spores in the subsequent generation.",

(2008) and Cai et al. (2020)], infecting the dinoflagellate host <em>Scrippsiella acuminata</em> strain ST167 (RCC1627). Mating types were explored by crossing the A120 strain with two other strains from the same ribotype, specifically A42 (RCC4395) and A48 (RCC4396). Media was prepared with Red Sea Salt (Red Sea Company, Duba\u00ef) diluted with distilled water to achieve a salinity of 27 PSU. Cultures used for metabolomics analyses, for which medium was prepared with natural seawater from the Penz\u00e9 Estuary collected at a salinity of 27 PSU complemented with 5% soil extract. Parasite cultures were synchronized in all experiments. This was achieved by removing old dinospores from the cultures so that released dinospores were all of the same age. Infected hosts at the beginning of infection (7-10 hours following parasite inoculation) were gently collected by gravity filtration on 5-10 \u00b5m nylon filters. Afterward, the filters with the host cells were rinsed on the same support device using fresh medium to ensure the removal of the remaining old dinospores, and the cells retained on the filter were then collected and diluted into a fresh medium in a new flask. Two days after inoculation, 40 mL of dinospore cultures were vacuum-filtered using 25 mm GF/C microfiber filters (Whatman).&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

Metabolome analysis, data processing, and peak deconvolution were performed using Compound DiscovererTM software 3.3 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with a comparative untargeted metabolomics workflow. The raw data were imported for peak deconvolution and metabolites annotation. The mass tolerance for MS identification was set at 5 ppm, the minimum MS peak intensity was 2 \u00d7 105, and the intensity tolerance for the isotope search was 30%. The relative standard deviation value was set to 50%.PCA was performed to compare the similarities of metabolites between cellular extracts of Amoebophrya dinospores using MetaboAnalyst 5.0 (Pang et al., 2021). The Interquantile filter was applied for all processed datasets, and the intensities were log-transformed and Pareto-scaled.&nbsp;</p>",
