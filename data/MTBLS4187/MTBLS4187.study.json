                "description": "<p>Osteoarticular tuberculosis is one of the extrapulmonary tuberculosis, which is mainly caused by direct infection of <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em> or secondary infection of tuberculosis in other parts. Due to the low specificity of the current detection method, it is leading to a high misdiagnosis rate and subsequently affecting the follow-up treatment and prognosis. Metabolomics is mainly used to study the changes of the body's metabolites in different states, so it can be served as an important means in the discovery of disease-related metabolic biomarkers and the corresponding mechanism research. Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used to detect and analyze metabolites in the serum with osteoarticular tuberculosis patients, disease controls and healthy controls to find novel metabolic biomarkers that could be used in the diagnosis of osteoarticular tuberculosis. Our results showed that 68 differential metabolites (p\uff1c0.05, Fold Change\uff1e1.0) were obtained in osteoarticular tuberculosis serum after statistical analysis. Then, through the evaluation of diagnostic efficacy, PC(o-16:1(9Z)/18:0), PC(20:4(8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z)/18:0), PC(18:0/22:5(4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z)), SM(d18:1/20:0), and SM(d18:1/18:1(11Z)) were found as potential biomarkers with high diagnostic efficacy. Using bioinformatics analysis, we further found that these metabolites share many lipids metabolic signaling pathways, such as choline metabolism, sphingolipid signaling, retrograde endocannabinoid signaling, sphingolipid and glycerophospholipid, these results suggest that lipid metabolism plays an important role in the pathological process of tuberculosis. This study can provide certain reference value for the study of metabolic biomarkers of osteoarticular tuberculosis and the mechanism of lipid metabolism in osteoarticular tuberculosis and even other tuberculosis diseases.</p>",

The diagnosis of TB group was based on the following criteria: (a) positive nucleic acid test of M.tb; (b) medical images (X-ray or CT scan etc) findings showed specific features of TB infection; (c) positive pathology diagnosis of TB in bone or joint specimens; (d) effective response to anti-tuberculosis treatments. The diagnosis of DC group was based on the following criteria: (a) positive inflammatory protein test; (b) specific clinical manifestations (joint stiffness in the morning or bending change etc); (c) medical images (X-ray or CT scan etc) findings showed specific features; (d) effective response to hormone treatments (glucocorticoid etc). The HC group included adults who without any disease clinical diagnosis and all the tests were negative or normal. Patients with any diagnosis of cancer, metabolic disease, autoimmunity disease, immunodeficiency disease, other pathogen infections were excluded from this study. And patients who have other organs tuberculosis (e.g., pulmonary tuberculosis or other extrapulmonary tuberculosis) were excluded as well. This research was carried out in strict accordance with the declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Ethics Committee of Chinese PLA General Hospital. All participants signed informed consent and gave their permission to use their blood samples for this study.</p><p><br></p><p>For each patient, 5 mL peripheral blood was drawn under vacuum vessel containing separation gel in the morning before any treatments. After blood coagulation and 2370 x g centrifugation, the serum was divided into several EP tubes and stored in -80 \u00b0C refrigerator for subsequent metabolomics analysis.</p><p><br></p><p>This study applied untargeted metabolomics which included reversed-phase chromatography (RPC) positive ion detection, reversed-phase chromatography (RPC) anion detection and hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) positive ion detection. The types of metabolites detected by these 3 modes are positively ion lipid, negatively ion lipid (e.g., fatty acid) and small polar molecules (e.g., amino acid), respectively.
