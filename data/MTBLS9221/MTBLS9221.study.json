                "description": "<p>Diet is a major determinant of gut microbiome composition, and variation in diet-microbiome interactions may contribute to variation in their health consequences. Understanding individual differences requires mechanistic understanding of dietary xenobiotics-microbiome interactions. Here, we map interactions between ~150 small molecule dietary xenobiotics and the gut microbiome, including community composition, compound metabolism, growth inhibitory effects and interindividual variation in these traits. Integrating these measures highlights mechanisms for community remodelling. We identify dietary xenobiotics with growth inhibitory activity and demonstrate how these compounds alter community composition. Microbial metabolism both toxifies and detoxifies these compounds, producing emergent interactions. We identify the gene and enzyme responsible for detoxification of one such dietary xenobiotic, resveratrol, and demonstrate that this enzyme contributes to interindividual variation in community remodelling. Together, these results systematically map interactions between dietary xenobiotics and the gut microbiome and suggest how toxification and detoxification contributes to interpersonal differences in microbiome response to diet.</p>",

Plates were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min to pellet cellular debris, then 10 \u03bcL was transferred to a new plate, diluted with 10 \u03bcL of water, and covered with a heat-sealing foil (Thermo-Scientific AB-0745). In experiments surveying many compounds at once, as in Figures 1A, 3D and S1B-D in the paper associated with this study, incubations were performed independently but then pooled for LC-MS analysis. Pools were chosen so that each dietary xenobiotic and its predicted metabolites could be distinguished using orthogonal mass and retention times. Every incubation was performed in biological duplicate or triplicate alongside sterile media controls.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>To prepare 'toxification screen' extracts for LC-MS, supernatant was harvested by centrifugation after 48 h of incubation, transferred new 96-well deep well plates, and frozen at -20 \u00b0C until processing. Supernatants were brought to room temperature before extract preparation. The supernatant was acidified with 0.1% formic acid and then applied to solid phase extraction resin cartridges in a 96-well format, pre-equilibrated with water + 0.1% formic acid (HyperSep Retain PEP 30 mg/1 mL 96 Removable Well Plate). Cartridge plates were centrifuged at 600 rpm for 20 min to bind the supernatant, then washed with 1 mL of 5% methanol + 0.1% formic acid followed by centrifugation. Extracts were eluted into 96 well deep-well plates through sequential application of 500 \u03bcL methanol, 50 \u03bcL DMSO and 500 \u03bcL methanol, each followed by centrifugation at 600 rpm. Elution fractions were dried through vacuum centrifugation followed by lyophilization, and finally resuspended in 20 \u03bcL DMSO.&nbsp;Extracts were diluted 1:100 in water prior to LC-MS analysis.</p>",
