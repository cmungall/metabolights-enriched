                "description": "Auricularia auricula is a well-known traditional edible and medicial fungus with high nutritional and pharmacological values, as well as metabolic and immunoregulatory properties. However, the exact mechanisms underlying the effects of Auricularia auricula polysaccharides (AAP) on obesity and related metabolic endpoints, including the role of the gut microbiota, remain insufficiently understood. To determine the mechanistic role of the gut microbiota in observed anti-obesogenic effects AAP, faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and pseudo germ-free mice model treated with antibiotics were also applied, together with 16S rRNA genomic-derived taxonomic profiling. HFD murine exposure to AAP thwarted weight-gains, reduced fat depositing, together with upregulating thermogenesis proteomic biomarkers within adipose tissue. These effects were associated with diminished intestine/bloodstream-borne lipid transportation, together with enhanced glucose tolerance. FMT administered in tandem with antibiotic treatment demonstrated the intestinal microbiota was necessary in deploying AAP anti-obesogenic functions. Intestine-dwelling microbial population assessments discovered AAP to enhance (in a selective manner) Papillibacter cinnamivorans, a commensal bacterium having reduced presence within HFD mice. Notably, HFD mice treated with oral formulations of Papillibacter cinnamivorans diminished obesity and was linked to decreased intestinal lipid transportation. Datasets from the present study show that AAP thwarted dietary-driven obesity and metabolism-based disorders through regulating intestinal lipid transportation, a mechanism that is dependent on the gut commensal Papillibacter cinnamivorans. These results indicated AAP and Papillibacter cinnamivorans as newly identified pre- and probiotics that could possibly serve as novel countermeasure against obesity",

The mice were randomly divided into 3 groups (n=10) and kept in cages (5 per cage) in a controlled, specific-pathogen-free room (21 \u00b1 2 \u00b0C, 12 h dark-light cycle) with food and water ad libitum. Once the animals were acclimatized for a week, the diets were changed to either <strong>low-fat diet</strong> (<strong>LFD</strong>) (Diets D12450-H, Fanbo, Shanghai, China) or <strong>high-fat diet</strong> (<strong>HFD</strong>) (Diets D12451, Fanbo, Shanghai, China) (see <strong>Table S1</strong> for the LFD and HFD formulations). Mice further received a daily, 8-week intragastric gavage of either 100 \u03bcL sterile 0.9% <strong>saline with AAP</strong> (200 mg/kg bodyweight) (HFD-treated, n=10) or 100 \u03bcL sterile 0.9% <strong>saline without AAP</strong> (0 mg/kg bodyweight) (HFD-treated, n=10; LFD-treated, n=10). At the pre-determined time, animals were fasted for 12 h, anesthetized, and then whole blood was obtained through retro-orbital sampling. After the mice were sacrificed, adipose tissue and organs were obtained and weighed. Fecal material was carefully collected and placed in cryotubes. The collected samples were then flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept frozen at -80 \u00b0C until further analysis. Sample preparation and metabolite determination by GC-TOF/MS were carried out according to our previous report<strong>[1][2]</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Jin M, Wang J, Zhang H, Zhou H, Zhao K.
