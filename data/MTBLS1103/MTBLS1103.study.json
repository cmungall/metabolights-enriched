                "description": "Practical diets for commercial barramundi production rarely contain greater than 10% starch, used mainly as a binding agent during extrusion. Alternative ingredients such as digestible starch have shown some capacity to spare dietary protein catabolism to generate glucose. In the present study, a carnivorous fish species, the Asian seabass (Lates calcarifer) was subjected to two diets with the same digestible energy: Protein (P) - with high protein content (no digestible starch); and Starch (S) - with high digestible (pregelatinized) starch content. The effects of a high starch content diet on hepatic glycogen synthesis as well as the muscle and liver metabolome were studied using a complementary approach of 1H and 2H NMR. The hepatosomatic index was lower for fish fed high starch content diet while the concentration of hepatic glycogen was similar between groups. However, increased glycogen synthesis via the direct pathway was observed in the fish fed high starch content diet which is indicative of increased carbohydrate utilization. Multivariate analysis also showed differences between groups in the metabolome of both tissues. Univariate analysis revealed more variations in liver than in muscle of fish fed high starch content diet. Variations in metabolome were generally in agreement with the increase in the glycogen synthesis through direct pathway, however, this metabolic shift seemed to be insufficient to keep the growth rate as ensured by the diet with high protein content. Although liver glycogen does not make up a substantial quantity of total stored dietary energy in carnivorous fish, it is a key regulatory intermediate in dietary energy utilization.",

Briefly, 2 groups of 30 juveniles barramundi (Lates calcarifer) (51.4 \u00b1 0.5 g) were housed in a recirculated seawater system (200 l; 28 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C temperature; 35 \u00b1 1% salinity; 7 mg/l dissolved O2). Each group was assigned one of the 2 experimental diets and were fed once daily to satiety, for 21 days. The diets were based on previous studies<strong>[2]</strong> and formulated to vary relative contributions of protein or starch while maintaining the same digestible energy: Protein (P) - with high protein content (no digestible starch); and Starch (S) \u2013 with high digestible (pregelatinized) starch content (see Table 1 in the paper associated with this study). Fish were then transferred into ~3.5% D-enriched seawater by adding 99.9% deuterated water (D2O; Sigma cat. no.151882), as previously described<strong>[3]</strong>. Fish were kept in D2O for a total of 6 days, being fed to satiety once daily for 5 days and sampled 24 h after last meal. Fish were anesthetized in Aqui-S\u00ae, measured, weighed, and blood samples were collected from the caudal vein with heparinised syringes. Fish were euthanized by overdose in the same anaesthetic; liver was excised and weighed. Hepatosomatic index (HSI) was calculated as: liver weight/body weight x 100. White muscle was collected from the epaxial quadrant (dorsal shoulder, above the midline) and weighed. Samples were stored at -80 \u00b0C until further analysis.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Viegas I, Trenkner LH, Rito J, Palma M, Tavares LC, Jones JG, Glencross BD, Wade NM.

Both liver and muscle samples of 5 fish were pooled into 6 replicate groups (pooled extraction/analyses: n=6 per diet). Samples were ground in N2 and tissue metabolites extracted following the MTBE method as described previously<strong>[1]</strong>. This method allows the precipitation of insoluble residue (containing glycogen) and aqueous and organic phase separation. Each were separated, transferred to new vials and lyophilized to eliminate residual solvents. Dried samples were kept at room temperature until further analysis. The aqueous phase was ready for 1H NMR acquisition. Glycogen was extracted from the insoluble residue resulting from the MTBE extraction by alcoholic precipitation after alkaline hydrolysis.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Matyash V, Liebisch G, Kurzchalia TV, Shevchenko A, Schwudke D.

Metabolite relative quantification was performed by peak integration on selected peaks for each metabolite using ACD\\Labs 12.0 Software. Variation between the groups was expressed as fold change (FC = relative concentration in S group/relative concentration in P group); and compared using Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney test, according to its conformity to normal distribution. Univariate analyses were performed in GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA). Differences were considered statistically significant at p&lt;0.05. Metabolites have been identified at Metabolomics Standards Initiative (MSI) level 2 according to the guidelines for metabolite identification<strong>[2]</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Tulpan D, L\u00e9ger S, Belliveau L, Culf A, Cuperlovi\u0107-Culf M.
