                "description": "<p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a devastating cerebrovascular disease with a poor prognosis. Accumulating studies have reported that gut microbiota contributes to the pathophysiology of several central nervous system diseases. However, whether SAH can change gut microbiota composition and affected gut microbiota is involved in the development of secondary brain injury following SAH remains unclear.</p><p><strong>METHODS:</strong> A retrospective case-control study was performed in unruptured intracranial aneurysm (UIA, CTL) and ruptured intracranial aneurysm (SAH) patients. Patients' fecal and serum samples were collected and sequenced by metagenome and metabolome. The experimental SAH mice models were established, and their feces and serum were also analyzed by 16S rRNA and metabolic sequencing. Fecal microbiota from SAH patients and mice was transplanted to ABX mice to investigate the relationship between the gut microbiota and secondary brain injury following SAH.</p><p><strong>RESULTS:</strong> SAH seriously influenced gut microbiota composition and significantly increased the relative abundance of the genus Escherichia. SAH also considerably reduced the production of gut microbiota-derived butyric acid. Furthermore, SAH-induced gut microbiota dysbiosis aggravated brain injury and cognitive deficits in ABX mice by promoting inflammatory response. Sodium butyrate (NaB) administration protected against secondary brain injury following SAH by inhibiting pyroptosis-related neuroinflammation, which is mediated by NLRP1/Caspase-1/GSDMD and Caspase-3/GSDME signaling pathways. NaB drinking pretreatment also alleviated secondary brain injury following SAH by increasing the relative abundance of butyric acid-producing bacteria, such as Dubosiella and Faecalibaculum, and decreasing the Escherichia abundance.</p><p><strong>CONCLUSION:</strong> SAH contributed to gut microbiota dysbiosis and changed gut microbiota exacerbated secondary brain injury after SAH. Supplement with gut microbiota-derived butyric acid protected against brain injury following SAH by inhibiting NLRP1/Caspase-1/GSDMD and Caspase-3/GSDME-mediated neuronal pyroptosis.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Linked studies:</strong></p><p><strong>UPLC-MS/MS</strong>&nbsp;assays&nbsp;of human samples are reported in&nbsp;this study.</p><p><strong>UPLC-MS/MS</strong>&nbsp;assays&nbsp;of&nbsp;&nbsp;murine samples are reported in&nbsp;<a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS9100' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS9100</strong></a>.</p>",

Intensities of each peak were recorded and a 3-dimensional matrix containing arbitrarily assigned peak indices (retention time-m/z pairs), sample names (observations) and ion intensity information (variables) was generated. The online <a href='https://www.genome.jp/kegg/' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>KEGG</strong></a>, <a href='https://hmdb.ca/' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>HMDB</strong></a> databases were used to annotate the metabolites by matching the exact molecular mass data (m/z) of samples with those from database. If a mass difference between observed and the database value was less than 10 ppm, the metabolite would be annotated, and the molecular formula of metabolites would further be identified and validated by the isotopic distribution measurements. We also used an in-house fragment spectrum library of metabolites to validate the metabolite identification. The intensity of peak data was further preprocessed by <strong>metaX</strong>. Those features that were detected in less than 50% of QC samples or 80% of biological samples were removed, the remaining peaks with missing values were imputed with the k-nearest neighbor algorithm to further improve the data quality. PCA was performed for outlier detection and batch effects evaluation using the pre-processed dataset. Quality control-based robust LOESS signal correction was fitted to the QC data with respect to the order of injection to minimize signal intensity drift over time. In addition, the relative standard deviations of the metabolic features were calculated across all QC samples, and those &gt; 30% were then removed. Student t-tests were conducted to detect differences in metabolite concentrations between 2 phenotypes. The P value was adjusted for multiple tests using an FDR (Benjamini\u2013Hochberg). Supervised PLS-DA was conducted through metaX to discriminate the different variables between groups. The VIP value was calculated. A VIP cut-off value of 1.0 was used to select important features.</p>",
