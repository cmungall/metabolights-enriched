                "description": "<p>Pmk1, a highly conserved pathogenicity-related mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in pathogenic fungi, is phosphorylated and activated by MAP2K and acts as a global regulator of fungal infection and invasive growth by modulating downstream targets. However, the hierarchical CcPmk1 regulatory network in <em>Cytospora chrysosperma</em>, the main causal agent of canker disease in many woody plant species, is still unclear. In this study, we analyzed and compared the phosphoproteomes and metabolomes of \u0394<em>CcPmk1</em> and wild-type strains and identified pathogenicity-related downstream targets of CcPmk1. We found that CcPmk1 could interact with the downstream homeobox transcription factor CcSte12 and affect its phosphorylation. In addition, the \u0394<em>CcSte12</em> displayed defective phenotypes that were similar to yet not identical to that of the \u0394<em>CcPmk1</em> and included significantly reduced fungal growth, conidiation and virulence. Remarkably, CcPmk1 could phosphorylate proteins translated from a putative secondary metabolism-related gene cluster, which is specific to <em>C. chrysosperma</em>, and the phosphorylation of several peptides was completely abolished in the \u0394<em>CcPmk1</em>. Functional analysis of the core gene (<em>CcPpns1</em>) in this gene cluster revealed its essential roles in fungal growth and virulence. Metabolomic analysis showed that amino acid metabolism and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, lipids, and lipid-like molecules significantly differed between wild type and \u0394<em>CcPmk1</em>. Importantly, most of the annotated lipids and lipid-like molecules were significantly downregulated in the \u0394<em>CcPmk1</em> compared to the wild type. Collectively, these findings suggest that CcPmk1 may regulate a small number of downstream master regulators to control fungal growth, conidiation and virulence in <em>C. chrysosperma</em>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Data availability:</strong></p><p>The proteomics data have been deposited into the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository with the data set identifier <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD032206' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>PXD032206</a>.</p>",

Generally, the strains were grown on potato dextrose agar (PDA) plate at 25 \u00b0C or PDB medium with shaking at 150\u2009rpm, 25 \u00b0C. To calculate the growth of each strain, the wild-type, gene deletion mutant and complemented strains were inoculated on the PDA plates and incubated at 25 \u00b0C. To determine the formation of pycnidia, each strain was grown on PDA plates for 30\u2009days. To analyze the tolerance of each strain to the H2O2, the conidial suspension (~106 spores/mL) was added into the melted PDA medium and mixed well. The filter was placed on the central of the plates and supplemented with 5\u2009\u03bcL 3 M H2O2. The inhibition zone diameter of each strain was measured. For lipid droplet staining, the fungal mycelia were harvested and stained with Nile red solution (50\u2009mM Tris/maleate buffer, 20\u2009mg/mL polyvinylpyrrolidone, and 2.5\u2009\u03bcg/mL Nile red, pH 7.5) at room temperature for 5 min. For pathogenicity assay, the healthy annual poplar twigs were collected from the nursery garden, and then cut into 20-cm-long segments. The truncated twigs were scorched with a flat iron (5\u2009mm in diameter), and inoculated with wild-type, gene deletion mutant and complemented strains. The inoculated twigs were placed in the trays to maintain humidity and incubated at 25 \u00b0C.
