                "description": "The distinct activities of cellular organelles are dependent on the proper function of their membranes. Coordinated membrane biogenesis of the different organelles necessitates interorganelle transport of lipids from their site of synthesis to their destination membranes. Several proteins and trafficking pathways have been proposed to participate in lipid distribution, but despite the basic importance of this process, in vivo evidence linking the absence of putative transport pathways to specific transport defects remains scarce. An obvious reason for this scarcity is the near absence of in vivo lipid trafficking assays. Here we introduce a versatile method named METALIC (Mass tagging-Enabled TrAcking of Lipids In Cells) to track interorganelle lipid flux inside living cells. In this strategy, two enzymes, one directed to a \u201cdonor\u201d and the other to an \u201cacceptor\u201d organelle, add two distinct mass tags to lipids. Mass spectrometry-based detection of lipids bearing the two mass tags is then used as a proxy for lipid exchange between the two organelles. By applying this approach to ER and mitochondria, we show that the ERMES and Vps13-Mcp1 complexes have lipid transport activity in vivo, and unravel their relative contributions to ER-mitochondria lipid exchange.",

The source was operated with a spray voltage of 2.9 kV in positive mode and 2.5 kV in negative mode. Sheath gas flow rate was set to 25 and 20 for positive and negative mode, respectively. MS data was acquired using either positive or negative polarization, alternating between full MS and all ion fragmentation (AIF) scans. Full scan MS spectra were acquired in profile mode from 107-1600 m/z with an automatic gain control target of 1e6, an Orbitrap resolution of 70,000, and a maximum injection time of 200 ms. AIF spectra were acquired from 107-1600 m/z with an automatic gain control value of 5e^4, a resolution of 17,500, a maximum injection time of 50 ms and fragmented with a normalized collision energy of 20, 30 and 40 (arbitrary units). Generated fragment ions were scanned in the linear trap. Positive-ion-mode was employed for monitoring PC and negative-ion-mode was used for monitoring PS and PE. Lipid species were identified based on their m/z and elution time. We used a standard mixture comprising PS 10:0/10:0, PE 17:0/17:0, PC 17:0/17:0, PG 17:0/17:0 and PI 12:0/13:0 for deriving an estimate of specific elution times.</p>",

Fraction of cyclopropylated species (<strong>Fig 2 </strong>in the paper associated with this study) upon constitutive expression of CFAse was calculated as (m+14) / (m + m+14).
