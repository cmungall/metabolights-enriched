                "description": "<p>Despite untargeted LC-MS/MS data being a powerful approach for large-scale metabolomics analysis, a significant challenge in the field lies in the reproducible and efficient analysis of such data, in particular. The power of R-based analysis workflows lies in their high customizability and adaptability to specific instrumental and experimental setups, but, while various specialized packages exist for individual analysis steps, their seamless integration and application to large cohort datasets remains elusive. Addressing this gap, we present an comprehensible end-to-end R workflow that leverages <em>xcms</em> and packages of the <em>RforMassSpectrometry</em> environment to encompass all aspects of pre-processing and downstream analyses for LC-MS/MS datasets in a reproducible manner.</p><p>This workflow delineates a step-by-step analysis of an example untargeted metabolomics dataset tailored to quantify the small polar metabolome in human plasma samples and aimed to identify differences between individuals suffering from a cardiovascular disease and healthy controls. The objective of the workflow is to meticulously detail each step, from the preprocessing of raw mzML files to the annotation of differentially abundant ions between the two groups. Our workflow seamlessly integrates Bioconductor packages, offering adaptability to diverse study designs and analysis requirements.</p><p>This workflow facilitates preprocessing, feature detection, alignment, normalization, statistical analysis and annotation within a unified framework, thereby enhancing the efficiency of metabolomic investigations. We also discuss alternative approaches to accommodate various dataset and goals, while emphasizing proper quality management for LC-MS data analysis. The source code of the workflow is available at https://github.com/EuracBiomedicalResearch/end-to-end-untargeted-metabolomics.</p>",

In ESI+ mode, the source temperature was set at 700 \u00b0C, the declustering potential at 30 V, the collision energy at 6 V, the ion spray voltage at 5120 V, the curtain gas at 25 psi, and ion source gases 1 and 2 at 60 psi. The instrument was mass calibrated by automatic calibration after every two sample injections, infusing the Sciex Positive Calibration Solution (part no. 4460131, AB Sciex, Foster City, CA, USA) for positive mode. LC-MS system maintenance was performed at the beginning of each plate batch to ensure high-quality data. Moreover, to monitor the retention time, mass accuracy and signal intensity, a system-suitability solution was injected. This solution was prepared in acetonitrile/water (50:50, v/v) and consisted of labeled amino acid standards at the following concentrations: alanine 13C315N (0.9 \u03bcg/mL), arginine 13C615N4 (1.8 \u03bcg/mL), glutamic acid 13C515N (1.5 \u03bcg/mL), methionine 13C515N (1.5 \u03bcg/mL), phenylalanine 13C915N (1.7 \u03bcg/mL), serine 13C315N (1.1 \u03bcg/mL) and valine 13C515N (1.2 \u03bcg/mL). In addition, to equilibrate the LC-MS system before the sample ran, pooled QC samples were injected 15 times in both the positive and negative modes. At the end of the equilibration injection sequence, we injected blanks to avoid carryover. Samples were then analyzed in a randomized order and pooled QC samples were injected between every 8 samples.</p><p><br></p><p>For LC-MS/MS data, the same settings were applied. Accumulation time for MS1 was set to 250 ms and for MS2 to 50 ms. Ions were selected for fragmentation based on an inclusion list and selecting the top 17 ions based on a data dependent acquisition (DDA) strategy. Dynamic background subtraction was disabled to ensure ions from the inclusion list being (preferentially) selected. The list of ions from the inclusion list were (m/z-rt pairs): 96.0445-41.5, 138.0547-148.3, 160.0369-162.4, 161.0400-162.3, 181.0719-47.2, 181.0722-34.3, 182.0747-46.8, 182.0750-34.3, 188.1757-169.9, 194.4682-32.6, 195.0877-32.6, 195.0878-38.6, 196.0904-32.6, 197.0924-32.9, 229.1298-181.5, 273.1318-34.0, 274.9944-131.5, 349.0759-170.8, 366.1097-183.8, 381.0798-183.7, 414.3011-58.5, 472.2010-36.4, 472.3038-57.4, 494.2857-58.8, 538.2597-136.8, 617.9998-32.1, 646.0309-29.6, 647.0342-29.8.</p>",

The analysis was performed in R version 4.4 with packages from the Bioconductor 3.19 release, in particular, xcms, Spectra and MetaboAnnotation. In brief, preprocessing was performed using xcms, with chromatographic peaks identified using the CentWave algorithm and refined using the 'MergeNeighboringPeaksParam' approach. Retention time alignment was performed using the PeakGroups method and correspondence with the PeakDensity method. Gap filling was performed using the 'ChromPeakAreaParam' approach. Data was normalized using median scaling. In a first filtering step the data set was reduced to features with at least 2 non-missing values in at least one of the study sample groups. Subsequently, a dispersion ratio (Dratio) filter was applied removing features with a Dratio larger than 0.4.</p><p><br></p><p>For differential abundance analysis, per-feature multiple regression models were fitted to the data using Bioconductor's limma package. P-values for significance of differential expression between the groups were adjusted for multiple hypothesis testing using the method from Benjamini and Hochberg for a strong control of the false discovery rate. Features with an adjusted p-value &lt; 0.05 were considered significant.</p>",
