                "description": "<p><em>Gastrodia elata</em> Blume (GE) has been widely used to treat various central and peripheral nerve diseases, and P-Hydroxybenzaldehyde (PHBA) is one of the indicative components of GE brain protection. Since the previous study of our group found that PHBA has a good effect on protecting mitochondria against cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury in rats (I/R). We will further explore how PHBA regulates the metabolic mechanism in blood after cerebral I/R to find an effective therapeutic target to prevent and treat IS. Firstly, using the rat model of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion/Reperfusion (MCAO/R). The therapeutic effect of PHBA on brain I/R was evaluated by neurological function score, triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC), Hematoxylin and eosin (HE), and Nissl staining. Secondly, a non-targeted metabonomic based on HPLC-QTOF-MS/MS was established to identify differential metabolites. Finally, we analyzed a targeted metabolic spectrum and verified the potential therapeutic targets. The results showed that the neurological function score, cerebral infarction area, hippocampal morphology, and the number of neurons in the PHBA group were significantly improved compared with the model group. Metabonomic analysis showed that 13 different metabolites were identified between the model and PHBA group, which may be involved in the 'tricarboxylic acid cycle', 'glutathione metabolism', 'mutual transformation of pentose and glucuronates', and so on. Among them, the most significant differential metabolite, dGMP, decreased significantly after PHBA treatment. We used WB to verify the expression of membrane-associated guanosine kinase PSD-95 and The subunit of glutamate AMPA receptor GluA1, which significantly increased after PHBA treatment. In addition, we also found that PHBA increased the expression of the light chain-3 protein (LC3) and autophagy effector protein 1 (Beline1) in WB while decreasing the expression of sequestosome-1 (p62), indicating that autophagy activity was promoted. Similarly, in TUNEL staining and detection of apoptosis-related proteins, it was found that MCAO/R up-regulated the expression of Bax and Cleaved-caspase-3 while down-regulated the expression of Bcl-2, and increased the apoptosis of hippocampal neurons, but PHBA could improve this situation. In summary, these results suggest that cerebral I/R causes postsynaptic dysfunction by disrupting the interaction between PSD-95 and AMPARs, and the inhibition of the autophagy system eventually leads to the apoptosis of hippocampal neurons.</p>",
