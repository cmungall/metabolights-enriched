                "description": "In the marine environment, macroalgae face changing environmental conditions and some species are known for their high capacity to adapt to the new factors of their ecological niche. Some macroalgal metabolites play diverse ecological functions and belong to the adaptive traits of such species. Because algal metabolites are involved in many processes that shape marine biodiversity, understanding their sources of variation and regulation is therefore of utmost relevance. This work aims at exploring the possible sources of metabolic variations with time and space of four common algal species from the genus Lobophora (Dictyotales, Phaeophyceae) in the New Caledonian lagoon using a UHPLC-HRMS metabolomic fingerprinting approach. While inter-specific differences dominated, a high variability of the metabolome was noticed for each species when changing their natural habitats and types of substrates. Fatty acids derivatives and polyolefins were identified as chemomarkers of these changing conditions. The four seaweeds metabolome also displayed monthly variations over the 13-months survey and a significant correlation was made with sea surface temperature and salinity. This study highlights a relative plasticity for the metabolome of Lobophora species.",

For the 'dead coral' and 'seaweed bed' transplants, supports were created with PVC slabs (297 x 420 mm), holding up 18 dead coral fragments fixed with Epoxy resin (see Fig. S7 in the paper associated with this study). 2 slabs were fixed with concrete reinforcing bars on the seaweed bed sandy floor (22\u00b018.956\u2032S; 166\u00b027.405\u2032E) or near the coral reef flat (22\u00b018.945\u2032S; 166\u00b027.403\u2032E) at Ricaudy. Algal fronds were then hooked up to the dead coral fragments. Some leaving coral colonies were used as support for the 'leaving coral' transplant at Ricaudy (see Table 3 in the paper associated with this study). 6 replicates (when possible) of each transplantation condition were picked up after 7 (t7) and 14 days (t14) of transplantation, and controls in natural habitat at the beginning of the experiment (t0) and after 7 (t7) and 14 days (t14) of experiment. They were placed in ziplock plastic bags, immediately soaked into ice and frozen at \u221220 \u00b0C until chemical extraction (80 samples, see Table S10 in the paper associated with this study).</p><p><br></p><p>Ref:</p><p>[1] Andrefouet, S.

Optimized parameters for XCMS were used as follows: peak picking (method = 'centwave', peakwidth = c(2,20), ppm = 15, mzdiff = 0.05, prefilter = c(0,0)), retention time correction (method = 'obiwarp'), matching peaks across samples (bw = 30, mzwid = 0.015, minfrac = 0.3) and filling in missing peaks. A matrix of compounds with peak intensity, m/z value and retention time was generated. The latter was filtered according to blanks and QC to remove technical variability using in-house R scripts (1-Filtering the matrix according to peaks present in blanks relative to pools (signal/noise ratio &gt; 10), 2-filtering the matrix according to peaks coefficient of variation (CV) calculated on pool (CV &lt; 20%) and 3-filtering the matrix according to autocorrelation between peaks). Data were normalized by log-transformation prior statistical analyses.</p>",

Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to visualize the metabolome variation according to sites (ade4 package for R). Powered Partial Least-Squares-Discriminant Analysis (PPLS-DA) were used to find the maximum covariance between our data set and their class membership. Permutational tests based on cross model validation (MVA.test and pairwise.MVA.test) were applied to test differences between groups (RVAideMemoire package). In a second time, correlation circles were drown to identify discriminating compounds (RVAideMemoire package). Venn diagrams were constructed with the Vennerable package for R. Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) was performed with MetaboAnalyst 3.0 (distance measure: Euclidean, clustering algorithm: Ward). Molecular network based on MS2 spectra were constructed with GNPS[58] and visualized under Cytoscape 3.5.0[59]. Metlin (https://metlin.scripps.edu/), SIRIUS 4.0[60] and in-house work were used for putative annotation.</p><p><br></p><p>Ref:</p><p>[1] Wang M, Carver JJ, Phelan VV, Sanchez LM, Garg N, Peng Y et al.
