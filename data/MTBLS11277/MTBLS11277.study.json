                "description": "<p>Tuberculosis (TB) remains a global health threat, aggravated by the emergence of drug-resistant strains. This study aims to identify genes and metabolic pathways with increased vulnerability in drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains compared to their drug-susceptible counterparts. Using CRISPR interference (CRISPRi), we screened for critical pathways unique or shared across resistant strains. The findings reveal potential therapeutic targets, offering new avenues for anti-TB drug development. This approach addresses the urgent need for effective treatments against drug-resistant TB and advances our understanding of its underlying resistance mechanisms. This work highlights how changes in the physiology of drug-resistant strains generate druggable vulnerabilities that can be exploited to improve clinical outcomes.</p>",

A total of 100 \u00b5L of these cultures were then used to inoculate T25 flasks containing 10 mL of fresh 7H9 medium. Once confluent (approximately 2 weeks), these cultures were used to inoculate 6 mL of fresh 7H9 to a density of OD600 0.25 and grown for a further ~48 h (OD600 of 0.5-1.2) in T25 flasks at 37 \u00b0C without shaking.</p>",

Chromatography conditions were performed as previously reported (89) with modifications. Briefly, separation was performed using a SeQuant zic-pHILIC column (150 mm x 4.6 mm, 5 \u00b5m particle size; Merck) at 25 \u00b0C, with a binary gradient of solvent A (20 mM ammonium carbonate (pH 9.0; Sigma-Aldrich) and solvent B (100% acetonitrile; Merck, 100029). The gradient of A/B solvents was run at a flow rate of 300 \u03bcL/min as follows: 0.0 min, 80% B; 0.5 min, 80% B; 15.5 min, 50% B; 17.5 min, 30% B; 18.5 min, 5%; 21.0 min, 5% B; 23.0-33.0 min, 80% A.</p>",
