                "description": "Toxicometabolomics, essentially applying metabolomics to toxicology of endogenous compounds such as drugs of abuse or new psychoactive substances (NPS), can be investigated by using different in vitro models and dedicated metabolomics techniques to enhance the number of relevant findings. The present study aimed to study the toxicometabolomics of the two NPS \u03b1-pyrrolidinobutiophenone (1-phenyl-2-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)butan-1-one, \u03b1-PBP) and \u03b1-pyrrolidinoheptaphenone (1-phenyl-2-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)heptan-1-one, \u03b1-PEP, PV8) in HepaRG cell line incubates. Evaluation was performed using reversed-phase and normal-phase liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry in positive and negative ionization mode, respectively, to analyze cells and cell media. Statistical evaluation was performed using one-way ANOVA, principal component discriminant function analysis, as well as hierarchical clustering. In general, the analysis of cells did not mainly reveal any features, but the parent compounds of the drugs of abuse. For \u03b1-PBP an increase in N-methylnicotinamide was found, which may indicate hepatotoxic potential of the substance. After analysis of cell media, significant features led to the identification of several metabolites of both compounds. Amino acid adducts with glycine and alanine were found, and these have not been described in any study before and are likely to appear in vivo. Additionally, significant changes in the metabolism of cholesterol were revealed after incubation with \u03b1-PEP. In summary, the application of metabolomics techniques after HepaRG cells exposure to NPS did not lead to an increased number of identified drug metabolites compared to previously published studies, but gave a wider perspective on the physiological effect of the investigated compounds on human liver cells.",

For each experiment, cells were maintained in an incubator (Binder, Tuttlingen, Germany) at 37 \u00b0C with 95% air humidity and 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cell handling was done under sterile conditions using a laminar flow bench class II (Thermo Scientific Schwerte, Germany). All given concentrations are final concentrations. Cryopreserved, differentiated HepaRG cells were cultivated according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions and seeded in a density of 80,000 cells/well in collagen-coated 96-well plates using Williams' E medium supplemented with 1% GlutaMAX, HPRG670, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 \u00b5g/ml streptomycin, and 0.5% DMSO on day 1. On day 2, this medium was replaced by the above described medium containing HPRG620 instead of ADD670 and subsequently renewed on day 5. On day 8, alpha-PBP and alpha-PEP were freshly dissolved in DMSO and subsequently diluted using the medium to the required concentration. The cell medium was finally renewed and additionally contained either 0 (group Blank), 12.5 (group Low) or 25 \u00b5M (group High) alpha-PBP or alpha-PEP, respectively. Each concentration was used in 9 different wells. Medium volume was always 100 \u00b5l. After 24 h of exposure, the medium was transferred into a second 96-well plate that was not collagen coated. The cells were washed twice using 100 \u00b5l of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS buffer). Both plates were shock frosted using liquid nitrogen and subsequently stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until analysis.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Richter LHJ, Herrmann J, Andreas A, Park YM, Wagmann L, Flockerzi V, M\u00fcller R, Meyer MR.

Mass calibration was done prior to analysis according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations using external mass calibration. Additionally before each experiment, the spray shield and capillary were cleaned. The performance of the column and the mass spectrometer was tested using a mixture as previously described<strong>[1][2]</strong> prior to every experiment. The HESI-II source conditions for every experiment were as follows: ionization mode, positive or negative; sheath gas, 60 AU; auxiliary gas, 10 AU; sweep gas, 3 AU; spray voltage, 3.50 kV in positive mode and -4.0 kV in negative mode; heater temperature, 320 \u00b0C; ion transfer capillary temperature, 320 \u00b0C; and S-lens RF level, 50.0. Mass spectrometry for untargeted metabolomics (UM) was performed according to a previously optimized workflow using full scan (FS) only<strong>[3]</strong>. The settings for FS data acquisition were as follows: resolution, 140,000 fwhm; microscans, 1; automatic gain control (AGC) target, 5 x 10^5; maximum injection time, 200 ms; scan range, m/z 50\u2013750; polarity, negative or positive; spectrum data type, centroid.</p><p><br></p><p>The settings for parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) data acquisition were as follows: resolution, 35,000 fwhm; microscans, 1; AGC target, 5 x 10^5; maximum injection time, 200 ms; isolation window, 1.0 m/z; collision energy (CE), 10, 20, or 40 eV; spectrum data type, centroid. The inclusion list contained the monoisotopic masses of all significant features and a time window of their retention time +/- 30 s. Analysis was performed using a randomized sequence order with 5 injections of pure methanol (reversed-phase chromatography) or eluent D (normal-phase chromatography) samples at the beginning of the sequence for apparatus equilibration, followed by 5 injections of the pooled QC sample. Additionally, 1 QC injection was performed every 5 samples to monitor batch effects as previously described<strong>[4]</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p>Analysis concerning additional incubations to confirm the formation of imines was performed using full scan (FS) data and subsequent data-dependent acquisition (DDA). The settings for FS data acquisition were as follows: resolution, 35,000; microscans, 1; automatic gain control (AGC) target, 1 x e^6; maximum injection time, 120 ms; and scan range, m/z 50-750. The settings for the DDA mode were as follows: dynamic exclusion, 0.1 s; resolution, 17,500; microscans, 1; loop count, 5; AGC target, 2 x e^4; maximum injection time, 250 ms; isolation window, m/z 1.0; high collision dissociation (HCD) with stepped normalized collision energy (NCE), 17.5, 35, and 52.5%; spectrum data type, profile; and underfill ratio, 1%. Additionally, an inclusion list containing m/z values of the suspected adducts was used, although <strong>MS2</strong> experiments were not limited to these (if idle, pick others). <strong>TF Xcalibur software version 3.0.63</strong> was used for all data handling.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Maurer HH, Meyer MR, Helfer AG, Weber AA (2018) Maurer/Meyer/Helfer/Weber MMHW LC-HR-MS/MS library of drugs, poisons, and their metabolites.

Peak picking was performed using <strong>XCMS</strong> in an <strong>R environment[2, Team R Core Team]</strong>; annotation of isotopes, adducts, and artifacts was performed using the <strong>R package CAMERA[3]</strong>. Optimization of <strong>XCMS</strong> parameters was in accordance with a previously optimized strategy<strong>[4]</strong>. Peak picking and alignment parameters are summarized in <strong>Table S1</strong> in the paper associated with the study. According to a previously published observation<strong>[5]</strong>, feature abundances with a value of zero were replaced by the lowest measured abundance as a surrogate LOD and subsequently log10 transformed. A batch correction was performed for those features that were detected in every QC sample. The corresponding feature abundance was corrected using a linear model to extrapolate its abundance drift between QC samples<strong>[5]</strong>. Additionally, all feature areas were normalized to the area of tryptophan-d5, to remove unwanted variation, e.g., from pipetting \u221280 \u00b0C extraction mixtures. Subsequently, a corresponding p value was calculated using a 1-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and insignificant features were removed from the data set. The data set was filtered keeping merely those features with a p-value of &lt;0.001. Patterns in the data set were subsequently investigated using principal component discriminant function analysis (PC-DFA) and hierarchical clustering. For principal component analysis, the features were centered. The subsequent discriminant analysis was performed using those principal components that fulfilled Kaisers's criterion, but at least 2. The quality of the model was assessed using its accuracy of predicting group membership, as well as Cohen\u2019s \u03ba after Monte Carlo cross-validation. Cohen\u2019s \u03ba was interpreted as previously proposed<strong>[6]</strong>. Hierarchical clustering was performed after row scaling, using Euclidean distances. The names of the features were adopted from XCMS using 'M' followed by the rounded mass and 'T' followed by the retention time in secs (e.g., 'M218T222' as given in <strong>Table S2</strong> of the paper associated with this study for protonated alpha-PBP at m/z 218.1538 and a retention time of 222 s by reversed-phase chromatography).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Adusumilli R, Mallick P.

The conditions were set according to published procedures<strong>[1][2]</strong>. Gradient reversed-phase elution was performed on a TF Accucore PhenylHexyl column (100 mm x 2.1 mm, 2.6 \u00b5m, TF, Dreieich, Germany) or on a hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) Nucleodur column (125 x 3 mm, 3 \u03bcm, Macherey\u2013Nagel, D\u00fcren, Germany) for normal-phase chromatography. The mobile phases for gradient elution using the PhenylHexyl column consisted of 2 mM aqueous ammonium formate containing acetonitrile (1%, v/v) and formic acid (0.1%, v/v, pH 3, eluent A), as well as 2 mM ammonium formate in acetonitrile and methanol (1:1, v/v), containing water (1%, v/v) and formic acid (0.1%, v/v, eluent B). The flow rate was set from 1\u201310 min to 500 \u00b5l/min and from 10\u201313.5 min to 800 \u00b5l/min using the following gradient: 0\u20131.0 min hold 99% A, 1\u201310 min to 1% A, 10\u201311.5 min hold 1% A, 11.5\u201313.5 min hold 99% A. Normal-phase chromatography was performed using aqueous ammonium acetate solution (200 mM, eluent C) and acetonitrile containing formic acid (0.1%, v/v, eluent D). For chromatography of imines, eluent C was replaced by aqueous ammonium formate solution (20 mM, eluent E) adjusted to pH 3 using formic acid and eluent D was replaced with a mixture of 200 mM aqueous ammonium formate and acetonitrile (1:10, v/v, eluent F). These experiments were performed on the HILIC column using the positive ionization mode. The flow rate was set to 500 \u00b5l/min using the following gradient: 0\u20131 min 2% C, 1\u20135 min to 20% C, 5\u20138.5 min to 60% C, 8.5\u201310 min hold 60% C, 10\u201312 min hold 2% C. For preparation and cleaning of the injection system, a mixture containing isopropanol and water (90:10, v/v) was used. The following settings were used: wash volume, 100 \u00b5l; wash speed, 4000 nl/s; loop wash factor, 2. Every analysis was performed at 40 \u00b0C column temperature, maintained by a Dionex UltiMate 3000 RS analytical column heater. The injection volume for metabolomics analyses was 1 \u00b5l and for those analyses investigating the formation of imines 10 \u00b5l.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Helfer AG, Michely JA, Weber AA, Meyer MR, Maurer HH.

The search was conducted by using the following libraries: <strong>NIST 14</strong> (<strong>nist_msms</strong> and <strong>nist_msms2</strong> sub-libraries) and Wiley <strong>METLIN</strong> Mass Spectral Database.
