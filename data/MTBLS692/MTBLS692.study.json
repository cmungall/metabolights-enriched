                "description": "<p>Coumarins or 1,2-benzopyrones comprise a large class of secondary metabolites ubiquitously found in the plant kingdom. In many plant species, coumarins are particularly important for iron acquisition and plant defense. Here we show that COUMARIN SYNTHASE (COSY) is a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of coumarins. Arabidopsis thaliana cosy mutants are strongly reduced in coumarin levels and accumulate o-hydroxyphenylpropanoids instead. Accordingly, cosy mutants have reduced iron content and show growth defects when grown under conditions where iron availability is limited. Recombinant COSY is able to produce umbelliferone, esculetin and scopoletin from their respective o-hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA thioesters via two reaction steps: a trans-cis isomerization followed by a lactonization. This conversion happens partially spontaneously and is catalyzed by light, which explains why the need for an enzyme for this conversion has been overlooked. The combined results show that COSY has an essential role in the biosynthesis of coumarins in organs that are shielded from light, such as roots. These findings provide routes to improving coumarin production in crops or via microbial fermentation.</p>",

PCA analysis was performed in R on the mean-centered and unit variance-scaled peak abundances using the function prcomp. Peaks that were detected in less than 5 chromatograms were excluded from the PCA analysis. For the univariate analysis, peaks were further filtered based on (i) their detection in all replicates of at least 1 genotype and (ii) their average normalized peak intensity being higher than 5000 in at least 1 genotype. For statistical analysis, peak intensities were ArcSinh transformed. The following filters were used to select peaks that were significantly different in abundance between the mutant and wild-type samples: ANOVA p-value <0.001, post-hoc t-test p-value <0.01 for both cosy-1 and cosy-2, and at least a 4-fold difference (of the normalized but non-transformed peak intensities) between wild type and both cosy-1 and cosy-2 mutants. Post-hoc t-test between 2 genotypes was only performed for peaks that were detected in all replicates of both genotypes. Peaks having a zero value in all replicates of 1 genotype and a value different from zero in all samples of the other genotype were considered as 'discrete' and thus significantly different between the genotypes. Peaks having a zero value in all replicates of 1 genotype and in 1 or more replicates of the other genotype were considered as 'undetermined'. In root samples, these filters resulted in 56 peaks, of which 40 had a higher peak area in the mutants as compared to the wild type and 16 had a lower peak area in the mutants. The 40 peaks with a higher peak area could be assigned to 24 compounds, of which 18 could be (partially) structurally characterized based on MS/MS. The 16 peaks with a lower intensity in the mutant samples could be assigned to 10 compounds of which 9 could be (partially) structurally characterized. A similar analysis for the stem samples did not result in any differential peaks. We therefore weakened the filter (ii) of the average normalized peak intensity area to > 1000 (for the root extracts, this filter was set to > 4000). Using this filter, scopoletin was picked up as the only metabolite with reduced abundance in both cosy-1 and cosy-2 mutants, and no peaks were found to be higher in abundance.</p>",
