                "description": "<p>UV-B radiation regulates numerous morphogenic, biochemical and physiological responses in plants, and can stimulate some responses typically associated with other abiotic and biotic stimuli, including invertebrate herbivory. Removal of UV-B from the growing environment of various plant species has been found to increase their susceptibility to consumption by invertebrate pests, however, to date, little research has been conducted to investigate the effects of UV-B on crop susceptibility to field pests. Here, we report findings from a multi-omic and genetic-based study investigating the mechanisms of UV-B-stimulated resistance of the crop, <em>Brassica napus</em> (oilseed rape), to herbivory from an economically important lepidopteran specialist of the <em>Brassicaceae</em>, <em>Plutella xylostella</em> (diamondback moth). The UV-B photoreceptor, UV RESISTANCE LOCUS 8 (UVR8), was not found to mediate resistance to this pest. RNA-Seq and untargeted metabolomics identified components of the sinapate/lignin biosynthetic pathway that were similarly regulated by UV-B and herbivory. Arabidopsis mutants in genes encoding two enzymes in the sinapate/lignin biosynthetic pathway, CAFFEATE O-METHYLTRANSFERASE 1 (COMT1) and ELICITOR-ACTIVATED GENE 3-2 (ELI3-2), retained UV-B-mediated resistance to <em>P. xylostella</em> herbivory. However, the overexpression of <em>B. napus</em> COMT1 in <em>Arabidopsis</em> further reduced plant susceptibility to <em>P. xylostella</em> herbivory in a UV-B-dependent manner. These findings demonstrate that overexpression of a component of the sinapate/lignin biosynthetic pathway in a member of the <em>Brassicaceae</em> can enhance UV-B-stimulated resistance to herbivory from <em>P. xylostella</em>.</p>",

Invertebrates were maintained on a diet of Chinese cabbage (var. Apex) in mesh-covered cages (40 x 40 x 60 cm).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Plant growth conditions:</strong></p><p><em>B. napus</em> were sown individually on compost and stratified at 4 \u00b0C in the dark for 4 d before transferring to controlled environment cabinets, where they were germinated and grown under 70 \u00b5mol/m^2/s white light (warm white fluorescent L36W/30 tubes; Osram, Munich, Germany) at 20 \u00b0C. Plants were grown under continuous white light to minimise the influence of circadian rhythm on transcriptional regulation. White light fluence rates were measured using a LI-250A light meter attached to a LI-190 quantum sensor (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE, USA).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>UV-B light sources:</strong></p><p>2 UV-B light sources were used during this project: narrowband UV-B (Philips TL20W/01RS; Philips, Aachen, Germany) and broadband UV-B (UVB-313; Q-Panel Company, USA). Broadband tubes were covered with a cellulose diacetate filter (Cat. No FLM400110/2925, West Design Products, London, UK) to remove short wavelength radiation below approximately 290 nm. Cellulose diacetate was replaced every 24 h. As the narrowband tubes did not emit these short wavelengths, they were not covered in cellulose diacetate. UV-B fluence rates were measured using a Spectro Sense 2 SKL904 meter and a UV-B sensor, SKU 430/SS2 (Skye Instruments, Powys, UK). Specific details of the UV-B treatments used for different experiments can be found in the relevant sections on Experimental Design.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>UV-B irradiation:</strong></p><p><em>B. napus</em> and <em>Arabidopsis</em> plants were grown under constant white light for 21 d before being transferred to 20 \u00b5mol/m^2/s white light conditions the night before treatment. \u2018Control\u2019 plants (\u2013UV-B) were exposed to 70 \u00b5mol/m^2/s white light whilst treated plants (+UV-B) were exposed to 3 \u00b5mol/m^2/s broadband UV-B radiation over a 24-h period. Treatments took place in the same growth cabinet, with -UV-B plants irradiated on the top shelf and +UV-B plants irradiated on the bottom shelf. White light and UV-B sensors were used to confirm no cross-contamination of light treatments between shelves in the growth cabinet. Whole <em>Arabidopsis</em> plants or the 2 most recently emerged true leaves from <em>B. napus</em> were harvested 1 h, 4 h, 8 h, 16 h and 24 h following the start of irradiation. 3 biological replicates were harvested for -UV-B and +UV-B-treated plants at each time point, with tissue flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 \u00b0C.</p><p><br></p><p>Plant methyl jasmonate application:</p><p>A stock solution of 1 M methyl jasmonate (MeJA; Sigma Aldrich) in 100% ethanol was kept at 4 \u00b0C. A working concentration of 100 \u00b5M MeJA in 0.01% ethanol was prepared fresh on the day of treatment, and a wetting agent, Surfac UN65 (Surfachem), was added to a final concentration of 0.01% (v/v). 3-wk old plants were sprayed with either 100 \u00b5M MeJA (plus 0.01% ethanol and 0.01% UN65, a wetting agent), a distilled water or an additional 0.01% ethanol 0.01% UN65 control. A total of 4 ml solution was applied to each plant. The inclusion of a 0.01% ethanol 0.01% UN65 application control ensured that these components of the formulation had no impact on <em>B. napus</em> at a transcriptional level. Because no transcriptomic differences were seen between <em>B. napus</em> plants treated with distilled water or a 0.01% ethanol 0.01% UN65 solution, the data from this additional control is not included in this report. After treatment, plants were maintained under 20 \u00b5mol/m^2/s white light in the same controlled growth chamber. To prevent cross-contamination across treatment groups, each plant was covered with a propagator. The youngest and second youngest true leaves of <em>B. napus</em> or whole <em>Arabidopsis</em> plants were harvested 1, 4, 8, 16 and 24 h after the start of treatment, with tissue flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 \u00b0C.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Invertebrate herbivory:</strong></p><p>Second instar <em>P. xylostella</em> larvae were collected from cages using a fine, damp paintbrush, and stored in a plastic container without food for 2 h prior to the start of plant treatments. 3-wk old plants previously grown under 70 \u00b5mol/m^2/s white light were transferred to an environmental cabinet set at 22 \u00b0C with a white light intensity of 20 \u00b5mol/m^2/s. Individual plants were placed in 60 x 40 x 40 cm mesh cages, and 3 starved larvae were transferred onto either the youngest and second youngest true leaves of <em>B. napus</em> or in the middle of an <em>Arabidopsis</em> plant. Larvae were allowed to graze for 1 h before being removed with a paintbrush, and plants were maintained under 20 \u00b5mol/m^2/s white light for up to 24 h. \u2018Control\u2019 plants that were not exposed to <em>P. xylostella</em> were maintained in the same growth cabinet during the course of the experiment, and kept in a separate cage on a shelf below the treated plants to prevent potential cross-contamination. Each time point was run in triplicate. Control plants and damaged leaf tissue from treated plants were harvested 1, 4, 8, 16 and 24 h after the removal of larvae, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Reverse-phase metabolomic analysis:</strong></p><p>Metabolomics analyses took place at the <strong>Glasgow Polyomics Facility</strong> (University of Glasgow). 3 independent replicates of <em>Brassica napus</em> leaf tissue treated with either 3 \u00b5mol/m^2/s UV-B radiation, 100 \u00b5M MeJA or <em>Plutella xylostella</em> herbivory were assessed via reverse-phase liquid chromatography (LC) coupled to mass spectrometry (MS). Plants were harvested 24 h after the onset of treatment alongside appropriate controls (see <strong>SI 3</strong> in the paper associated with this study): 70 \u00b5mol/m^2/s white light (UV-B control); 4 ml distilled water (MeJA control); or no herbivory (herbivory control). </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Sparrow PAC, Smedley M, Harwood M.

Source mass spectrometry settings were as follows: a HESI probe was used with AGC 1 x 10^6 (full scan mode) and 5 x 10^4 (MSn mode), sheath gas 10 a.u., auxiliary gas 3 a.u., sweep gas 3 a.u., capillary temperature 275 \u00b0C, source voltage 5 kV, source current 100 \u00b5A, S-lens RF 67.3%, skimmer offset 0 V, maximum ion times of 500 ms (full scan mode) and 100 ms (MSn mode), and all scans consisted of 1 microscan. Data was obtained in profile mode, for full scans the m/z window was 70.00\u20131000.00 and the resolution was set to 240.000. For LC\u2013MS/MS fragmentation experiments also run, key settings were: isolation width of 1.0 Da, minimum signal required of 500, first mass fixed at 50.00 m/z (HCD), and a dynamic exclusion of 48 s. A rejection list was included with the 4 most intense ions encountered in blank injections. HCD fragmentation spectra of the most intense ion (data-dependent acquisition) in the full scan were obtained at 30, 70, and 110 normalised collision energies (NCE). CID-MSn (n \u22643) fragmentation was performed as previously described<strong>[1]</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> van der Hooft JJ, Akermi M, \u00dcnl\u00fc FY, Mihaleva V, Roldan VG, Bino RJ, de Vos RC, Vervoort J.

The aim of the invertebrate choice chamber bioassays was to determine the influence of a \u2018fixed\u2019 effect (light treatment or plant genotype) on larval feeding preferences (the \u2018response\u2019 variable). As a total of 4 biological replicates (n = 4) could be run at any given time, data for bioassays with \u2018n &gt; 4\u2019 was obtained by running batches of biological replicates on different days. We wanted to determine if the biological replicate number or day on which the replicate batches were conducted influenced the response, and therefore ran <strong>linear mixed effect models (LMMs)</strong> with \u2018biological replicate number\u2019 nested within \u2018day of bioassay\u2019 as the \u2018random\u2019 effects. The analysis was conducted using the R package \u2018nlme\u2019. A random-intercepts fixed-slopes model was also fitted, to determine any interactions between the fixed effects and the starting leaf area of plants. This test accounted for subtle variation in starting leaf area between -UV-B and +UV-B-treated plants, with plants grown in the absence of UV-B typically slightly bigger than those grown in its presence. In all instances, interaction effects were found to be non-significant, indicating that any variation in starting leaf area on different genotypes or plants grown under distinct light treatments did not influence invertebrate feeding preferences. As such, this interaction term was removed, and the <strong>t-values</strong> and <strong>P-values</strong> from linear models using both random effects and a single fixed effect (light treatment or genotype) are presented. The level of significance was set at 0.05. <strong>Standard error of the mean (SEM)</strong> error bars are included on bar charts to show the spread of variation of the sample means. Gene expression analysis data was statistically analysed using <strong>ANOVA</strong>.</p>",
