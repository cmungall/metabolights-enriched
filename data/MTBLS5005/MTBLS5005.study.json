                "description": "<p>Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) prevalence is rising with no pharmacotherapy approved. A major hurdle in NASH drug development is the poor translatability of preclinical studies to safe/effective clinical outcomes, and recent failures highlight a need to identify new targetable pathways. Dysregulated glycine metabolism has emerged as a causative factor and therapeutic target in NASH. Here, we report that the tripeptide DT-109 (Gly-Gly-Leu) dose-dependently attenuates steatohepatitis and fibrosis in mice. To enhance the probability of successful translation, we developed a nonhuman primate model that histologically and transcriptionally mimics human NASH. Applying a multiomics approach combining transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and metagenomics, we found that DT-109 reverses hepatic steatosis and prevents fibrosis progression in nonhuman primates, not only by stimulating fatty acid degradation and glutathione formation, as found in mice, but also by modulating microbial bile acid metabolism. Our studies describe a highly translatable NASH model and highlight the need for clinical evaluation of DT-109.</p>",

The study was performed in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (8th edition, 2011). NASH predisposed monkeys were screened from over 1000 cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) at the Spring Biotechnology site. In total 69 male monkeys (age \u2265 9 years, BMI &gt; 30) were selected and housed in individual cages with access to water and food ad libitum. Monkeys were housed in a temperature-controlled room (22-26\u00b0C) with 12 h dark and light cycles. Before physical examination (body weight, waist circumference and abdominal circumference) and liver biopsy, monkeys were anesthetized with ketamine hydrochloride (10\u2009mg/kg body weight). The waist circumference was measured at the midpoint between the last rib and the iliac crest, and the abdominal circumference was measured at the height of the umbilicus. For the liver biopsy, a Bard Magnum biopsy gun (Bard Biopsy Systems, Tempe, AZ, USA) loaded with a 17-gauge biopsy needle (Argon, Athens, TX, USA) was used for under the guidance of an ultrasound system (Landwind, P09, Shenzhen, China). The collected liver tissues were then stored in formalin or -80 \u00b0C. In total 20 monkeys with a NAS of 1-3 were defined as NASH predisposed and were fed our newly-developed NASH diet (<strong>Table S1</strong> in the paper associated with this study). After 10 months on the NASH diet, physical examination was repeated, blood samples were collected for biochemical analyses and liver biopsies were obtained for histopathological analysis and transcriptomics. The 20 monkeys were randomized to receive orally (gavage) <strong>DT-109</strong> at 150 mg/kg body weight/day (<strong>treatment</strong>) or equivalent volume of <strong>H2O</strong> (<strong>vehicle control</strong>) for 5 additional months on the NASH diet. Through physical, biochemical and histological (biopsy-based) assessments, all NASH-related parameters were confirmed to be comparable between the DT-109 and control groups before initiating the intervention study. At endpoint, blood samples were collected and the monkeys were then anaesthetized using ketamine hydrochloride (15\u2009mg/kg body weight) before euthanized by exsanguination. Whole livers were quickly removed, then perfused with cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Collected liver tissues were stored in liquid nitrogen or formalin.</p>",

The instrument stability was monitored using QC samples. The intensity of extracted variables was normalized to the total areas to reduce the variations from sample injection and enrichment factor. After peak deconvolution, alignment, integration and normalization, a table containing retention times, exact mass pairs and normalized intensities of each variable were obtained for multivariate statistical analysis. Then, all normalized Pareto-scaled data were imported into <strong>SIMCA-P</strong> v14.1 software (Umetrics AB, Umea, Sweden) for multivariate statistical analysis. The cross-validation was used to test the model validity against overfitting. Potential biomarker candidates were selected based on variable importance in projection (VIP &gt; 1), S-plot, and the raw data plot in orthogonal partial least-square discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) model, and independent t-test (p&lt;0.05). The number of components of the principal component analysis (PCA) and OPLS-DA were 4 and 4, respectively. Finally, the fragment, isotope and adduct ions were manually removed according to the corresponding extracted ion chromatograms (XICs) and the potential biomarkers were screened out. The structure of potential biomarkers was identified according to the significance of their contribution to variable classification, which was determined by the VIP plot and jack-knifing confidence interval (\u22650) in the OPLS-DA model as described above.</p><p><br></p><p>For characterization of potential biomarkers, we used <strong>Metabolomics Pathway Analysis</strong> (<strong>MetPA</strong>), a web-based and visual tool used to analyze metabolomic data within the biological context of metabolic pathways and to identify the most relevant pathways in a metabolic study. We further used, <strong>MetaboAnalyst</strong> 5.0 (<a href='https://www.metaboanalyst.ca' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>https://www.metaboanalyst.ca</a>) Functional Analysis module. This module accepts high-resolution LC-MS (HRMS) spectral peak data to perform metabolic pathway enrichment analysis and visual exploration based on the well-established mummichog algorithm. The following parameters were used in the pathway enrichment process: normalization by median, Log transformed (base 10), pareto scaling, Homo sapiens (human) [<strong>KEGG</strong>]. Altered metabolic pathways were visualized by bubble charts using Online tackle <strong>HIPLOT</strong> (<a href='https://hiplot.com.cn/basic' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>https://hiplot.com.cn/basic</a>) and <strong>MetPA</strong>. In addition, to further investigate changes in identified metabolites by DT-109 administration, we conducted an intuitive characterization by means of clustering heatmap, using <strong>HemI</strong>, a toolkit for illustrating heatmaps.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Larkin JR, Anthony S, Johanssen VA, Yeo T, Sealey M, Yates AG, Smith CF, Claridge TDW, Nicholson BD, Moreland JA, Gleeson F, Sibson NR, Anthony DC, Probert F.

Mass tolerance for database search was 5 ppm for MS, and 15 ppm for MS/MS. Subsequently, the potential biomarkers obtained were identified as described previously<strong>[1]-[3]</strong>. Briefly, the [M+H]+ or [M-H]- ions of the metabolites was obtained by high-resolution mass spectrometry, and the possible molecular composition of the metabolites was obtained based on the accurate mass of the molecular ion and the isotope abundance ratio. To obtain structural information, we conducted LC-MS/MS spectrum analysis and performed a public mass spectrum library search using the resulting MS/MS spectra as query. Possible structures were inferred through database search including <strong>HMDB</strong> (<a href='https://hmdb.ca/' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>https://hmdb.ca/</a>), <strong>Massbank</strong> (<a href='http://massbank.imm.ac.cn/MassBank' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>http://massbank.imm.ac.cn/MassBank</a>) and <strong>METLIN</strong> (<a href='https://metlin.scripps.edu/' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>https://metlin.scripps.edu/</a>) with exact molecular weights. In addition, the retention time and fragmentation characteristic ions were obtained by LC-MS/MS analysis of commercial standards, and comparative analysis with <strong>Progenesis QI</strong> software (Waters, Milford, MA, USA)&nbsp;was used to finally confirm the structure of the metabolites.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> An Z, Chen Y, Zhang R, Song Y, Sun J, He J, Bai J, Dong L, Zhan Q, Abliz Z.
