The metabolites with VIP &gt; 1, p &lt; 0.05 were determined as significantly different metabolites based on the Variable importance in the projeciton (VIP) obtained by the OPLS-DA model and the p-value generated by student\u2019s t test. Differential metabolites among two groups were mapped into their biochemical pathways through metabolic enrichment and pathway analysis based on KEGG database (http://www. genome.jp/kegg/). These metabolites could be classified according to the pathways they involved or the functions they performed. Enrichment analysis was used to analyze a group of metabolites in a function node whether appears or not. The principle was that the annotation analysis of a single metabolite develops into an annotation analysis of a group of metabolites. Python packages \u201cscipy.stats\u201d (https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy) was used to perform enrichment analysis to obtain the most relevant biological pathways for experimental treatments.</p>",
