                "description": "During heart transplantation, storage in cold preservation solution is thought to protect the organ by slowing metabolism; by providing osmotic support; and by minimising ischaemia-reperfusion (IR) injury upon transplantation into the recipient. Despite its widespread use, our understanding of the metabolic changes prevented by cold storage and how warm ischaemia leads to damage is surprisingly poor. Here, we compared the metabolic changes during warm ischaemia (WI) and cold ischaemia (CI) in hearts from mouse, pig, and human. We identified common metabolic alterations during WI and those affected by CI, thereby elucidating mechanisms underlying the benefits of CI, and how WI causes damage. Succinate accumulation is a major feature within ischaemic hearts across species, and CI slows succinate generation, thereby reducing tissue damage upon reperfusion caused by the production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS). Importantly, the inevitable periods of WI during organ procurement led to the accumulation of damaging levels of succinate during transplantation, despite cooling organs as rapidly as possible. This damage was ameliorated by metabolic inhibitors that prevented succinate accumulation and oxidation. Our findings suggest how WI and CI contribute to transplant outcome and indicate new therapies for improving the quality of transplanted organs.",

Mice were maintained in specific-pathogen-free animal facilities with ad libitum access to food and water. Mice were picked at random from the same cage and assigned to control and experimental arms, but no effort was made to ensure that littermate controls were used. Large white male (Landrace) pigs (45\u201355 kg) were supplied by Envigo and were acclimated for a minimum of 7 d prior to experiments, with ad libitum access to food and water. All animal experiments were approved by the UK Home Office under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. Mouse experiments were covered by PPL 80/2638.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Human tissue:</strong></p><p>Heart biopsies were taken from deceased human DBD donors deemed unsuitable for cardiac transplantation aged 36\u201369 (Supplementary Table 1). Informed consent for the use of the human tissue for this project was provided by the donors\u2019 families. Ethical approval for the studies was obtained from NRES Committee East of England\u2014Cambridge South (REC Reference 15/EE/0152).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Mouse heart experiments:</strong></p><p>C57BL/6 mice (female) were anaesthetized with isoflurane (Abbott Laboratories, US) 2 MAC and O2 at 2 l/min. Heparin (100 \u03bcl bolus (25 iU) Leo Pharma A/S, Ballerup, Denmark) was administered intravenously into the inferior vena cava (IVC) prior to retrieval. Hearts were excised by division of the major vessels. To measure metabolite concentrations in the heart under baseline conditions in vivo, the still-beating heart of an anesthetized mouse was rapidly frozen using Wollenberg clamps at liquid nitrogen (LN2) temperature, taking &lt;5 s to become frozen. For cold ischemia (CI), the heart was placed directly in UW solution at ~2 \u00b0C. Under these conditions, the ventricles pulsed once or twice before stopping. For warm ischaemia (WI), the excised heart was left in the abdomen of the animal, with the abdominal wound closed and the animal maintained on a 37 \u00b0C heating pad with a relayed rectal temperature probe. For analysis at various times the whole heart was clamped at LN2 temperature as above. At various timesthe tissues were rapidly snap-frozen and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until analysis. Fully oxygenated 'normoxic' heart tissue, snap-frozen immediately upon cessation of circulation, was used as control. Tissues were stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until extraction and analysis.</p><p><br></p><p>To replicate heart retrieval with retrograde flushing of the coronary vessels during retrieval (see Fig. S4e in the paper associated with this study), the donor animal was prepared as previously described[1]. 500 \u03bcl Soltran (Baxter Healthcare) was then injected via a fine bore (0.28 x 0.165 mm) polyethene tube (Portex tubing, Smith Medical International Ltd, UK) into the aorta to antegrade flush the coronary arteries. The prepared hearts were then placed in UW solution at ~2 \u00b0C for various durations of CI, after which the whole heart was clamped at the LN2 temperature as described above. For other mouse-heart experiments, a 500 \u03bcl bolus of St Thomas\u2019 Cardioplegia solution was administered by IVC injection. Complete cessation of heart beat was observed visually within 2 s. Dimethyl malonate (DMM) was administered as an infusion over 10 min via the IVC by a microinfusion pump (Kd Scientific, Holliston, MA, USA) using a fine bore (0.28 x 0.165 mm) polyethene tube (Portex tubing, Smith Medical International Ltd, UK) prior to the administration of cardioplegia. Control animals were infused with 0.9% wt/vol sodium chloride by microinfusion pump (Kd Scientific, Holliston, MA, USA). Bis(acetoxymethyl)succinate (with 5% DMSO) or bis(acetoxymethyl)fumarate (with 30% DMSO) was administered in the cardioplegia solution. Hearts from donor mice were transplanted heterotopicallyinto a syngeneic recipient[2][3]. In summary, end to side anastomoses, of the donor ascending aorta to the recipient descending aorta, and the donor pulmonary artery to the recipient IVC were performed using microsurgical techniques. All transplanted hearts contracted spontaneously following reperfusion. Hearts were excised by division of the anastomosed vessels at chosen time points after reperfusion, and the hearts were snap frozen using a Wollenberg clamp and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until tissue extraction. Animals were randomly allocated to control and treatment groups and the analysis was performed blinded to the experimental groups.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Pig heart experiments:</strong></p><p>Pigs were pre-medicated with intramuscular ketamine (10 mg/kg (body weight)), medetomidine (0.02 mg/kg (body weight)) and midazolam (0.1 mg/kg (body weight)). A peripheral intravenous catheter was placed in the marginal ear vein, and Propofol was used as anaesthesia. Pigs were intubated and 100% oxygen supplied with intermittent positive pressure ventilation provided to maintain normocapnia. Anaesthesia was maintained with continuous infusions of propofol (starting at 10 mg/kg (body weight)/hr[4] and titrating down to effect) and either remifentanil (starting at 2.4 \u03bcg/kg (body weight)/hr and titrating up to effect) or alfentanil (starting at 30 \u03bcg per kg (body weight)/hr and titrating up to effect). If required, isoflurane was provided at approximately 2% to maintain anaesthesia. Saline was administered intravenously at approximately 10 ml per kg (body weight)/hr. During anaesthesia a Datex Ohmeda Cardiocap patient monitoring system was used to monitor ECG waveform, pulse oximetry, temperature and capnography parameters. Immediately following euthanization (induced rapidly with an overdose of approximately 200 mg/kg (body weight) pentobarbitone), the thoracic cavity was accessed through the diaphragm and the apex of the heart (~20\u201330 g) was amputated with a scalpel under terminal anaesthesia. We note that this retrieval procedure, particularly the use of anaesthesia, is unavoidable, but is slightly different from that used in human transplantation. A full thickness tissue sample (~120 mg) was immediately clamped frozen using Wollenberger clamps at LN2 temperature, which took &lt;5 s from cessation of aortic pulse to freezing. The rest of the tissue was cut in half, with 1 half transferred to cold storage solution and then further cut into smaller pieces (~120 mg), which were stored in UW storage solution at ~2 \u00b0C. The other half of the heart tissue was also cut into sections (~120 mg), which were stored in a humidified atmosphere at 37 \u00b0C by suspension above saline in sealed Eppendorf tubes. At various times, the tissues were then frozen using Wollenberger clamps at LN2 temperature and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until analysis.</p><p><br></p><p>To measure the core and surface temperature and tissue succinate of the porcine heart following rapid retrieval and back-table flush, the pig was anaesthetized and euthanized as described above. After circulatory arrest was confirmed, the thoracic cavity was then rapidly accessed through an incision in the diaphragm, and heart was rapidly retrieved by division of the great vessels. biopsy were immediately taken and clamp frozen in LN2. The core and surface temperature probes (K-type thermocouple, Hanna Instruments, Bedfordshire) were then inserted into the heart. The core temperature probe was inserted into the septum using a hollow biopsy needle. A small incision was made in the surface of the right ventricle, in which the surface probe was inserted and sutured in place. This step took between 1-2 min to complete. Temperature recording then commenced, and the heart was submerged in a pre-prepared dish of slushed ice and UW solution. The temperature was recorded every second by a digital datalogger connected to the temperature probe (EL-USB-2 LC, Lascar Electronics, Wiltshire). A 14-G French cannula was used to flush the coronary circulation with cold UW solution. A third temperature probe was used to measure the temperature of the solution as it entered the heart. The coronary sinuses at the base of the aorta were alternately cannulated, and effective flushing of the circulation could be directly observed by flushing of blood with preservation solution in the surface coronary vessels. The time taken to flush the heart with 500 ml cold UW solution was recorded in each case. Further surface wedge and core-needle biopsies were taken at 6, 12 and 30 min.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Human heart experiments:</strong></p><p>Human donation after brainstem death (DBD) donors undergoing abdominal multiorgan retrieval but for whom cardiothoracic organs had been declined for transplantation were identified (see Table S1 in the paper associated with this study). Formal consent for research was obtained from the families of the donors. A thoracotomy was performed as a routine part of the abdominal organ retrieval procedure, thus allowing a sample (~20\u201330 g) of myocardium from the apex of the still-beating heart to be removed at the same time as exsanguination and cross clamp of the donor during organ retrieval. The heart tissue was frozen in Wollenberg clamps, taking &lt;5s to go from the beating oxygenated heart to frozen sample. After this base line sample, further samples (~120 mg) were removed, maintained at either 37 \u00b0C or ~2 \u00b0C as described for the pig tissue, and at various times frozen and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C.</p><p><br></p><p>Ref:</p><p>[1] Dare AJ, Logan A, Prime TA, Rogatti S, Goddard M, Bolton EM, Bradley JA, Pettigrew GJ, Murphy MP, Saeb-Parsy K.
