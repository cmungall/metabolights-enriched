                "description": "<p>Seagrasses are one of the most efficient natural sinks of carbon dioxide (CO2) on Earth. Despite covering less than 0.1% of coastal regions, they have the capacity to bury up to 10% of marine organic matter and can bury the same amount of carbon 35 times faster than tropical rainforests. On land, the soil\u2019s ability to sequestrate carbon is intimately linked to microbial metabolism. Despite the growing attention to the link between plant production, microbial communities, and the carbon cycle in terrestrial ecosystems, these processes remain enigmatic in the sea. Here, we show that seagrasses excrete organic sugars, namely in the form of sucrose, into their rhizospheres. Surprisingly, the microbial communities living underneath meadows do not fully use this sugar stock in their metabolism. Instead, sucrose piles up in the sediments to mM concentrations underneath multiple types of seagrass meadows. Sediment incubation experiments show that microbial communities living underneath a meadow use sucrose at low metabolic rates. Our metagenomic analyses revealed that the distinct community of microorganisms occurring underneath meadows is limited in their ability to degrade simple sugars, which allows these compounds to persist in the environment over relatively long periods of time. Our findings reveal how seagrasses form blue carbon stocks despite the relatively small area they occupy. Unfortunately, anthropogenic disturbances are threatening the long-term persistence of seagrass meadows. Given that these sediments contain a large stock of sugars that heterotopic bacteria can degrade, it is even more important to protect these ecosystems from degradation.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>GC-MS assay of Plant tissues</strong> is reported in the current study <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS1579' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS1579</strong></a></p><p><strong>GC-MS assay of Seawater sediment</strong> is reported in <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS1570' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS1570</strong></a></p><p><strong>GC-MS assay of Sediment porewater</strong> is reported in <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS1610' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS1610</strong></a></p><p><strong>MALDI-MSI assay of Plant roots</strong> is reported in the <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS1746' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS1746</strong></a></p>",

Briefly, tissues form frozen plants were separated into leaves, rhizomes, and roots and ground under liquid nitrogen into a find dust using a mortar and pestle. Approximately 400 mg of ground plant tissue was aliquoted into Eppendorf vials. Pre-cooled methanol (1.4 ml) was added to each aliquot and vortexed for 10 s. Tissues were extracted at 70 \u00b0C for 10 min in a thermomixer at 950 rpm and subsequently centrifuged to pellet the tissue at 11,000 x g at 4 \u00b0C. The supernatant was transfer to 14 ml glass vials. To separate the polar and non-polar compounds, 750 \u00b5l of chloroform and 1.5 ml of high grade water was added to each sample, vortexed for 10 s and centrifuged for 15 min at 2,200 x g. 25 \u00b5l of the upper, polar-phase was dried to completeness in a vacuum concentrator without heating (approx 1 hr) after which the aliquots were stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until metabolite dativization.</p><p><br></p><p>To prepare marine samples for gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis, 0.5 of a saltwater sample was dried in a speed vacuum concentrator for 8 hr (Eppendorf Concentrator Plus(R), 45 \u00b0C, V-AQ). To further remove residual water locked within the salt pellet, 250 \u00b5l of toluene (99.8%, &lt; 0.2% water) was added to each sample and the mixture was ultrasonicated for 10 min at maximum intensity. The toluene was subsequently removed under a gentle flow of N2 gas. Metabolite derivatization was performed by adding 80 \u00b5l of MeOX dissolved in pyridine (20 mg/ml) to the dried pellet. The mixture was ultrasonicated (EMag Emmi-12HC) for 10 min at maximum intensity, briefly vortexed to dissolve the pellet into solution, and subsequently incubated for 90 min at 37 \u00b0C using a thermal rotating incubator under constant rotation at 1350 rpm. The pyridine was removed from the sample at room temperature under a gentle flow of N2 gas (approx 1 hr). Following the addition of 100 \u00b5l of BSTFA, the mixture was ultrasonicated for 10 min at maximum intensity, vortexed, and incubated for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C using a thermal rotating incubator under constant rotation at 1350 rpm. The derivatized mixture was ultrasonicated for 10 min at maximum intensity. Remaining salt in each sample was pelleted through centrifugation at 21.1 x g for 2 min at 4 \u00b0C. 100 \u00b5l was transferred to a GC-MS vial for analysis.</p><p><br></p><p>Ref:</p><p>[1] Lisec J, Schauer N, Kopka J, Willmitzer L, Fernie AR.

The inlet liner was changed after every 50 samples when processing porewater extracts and after 100 samples when processing seagrass tissues to avoid damage to the GC column.
