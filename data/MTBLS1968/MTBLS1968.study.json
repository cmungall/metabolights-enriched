                "description": "<p>Plants produce thousands of compounds, collectively called the metabolome, which mediate interactions with other organisms. The metabolome of an individual plant may change according to the number and nature of these interactions. We tested the hypothesis that tree diversity level affects the metabolome of four subtropical tree species in a biodiversity ecosystem-functioning experiment, BEF-China. We postulated that the chemical diversity of leaves, roots and root exudates increases with tree diversity. We expected the strength of this diversity effect to differ among leaf, root and root exudates samples. Considering their role in plant competition, we expected to find the strongest effects in root exudates. In an ecometabolomics approach, roots, root exudates and leaves of four tree species (Cinnamomum camphora, Cyclobalanopsis glauca, Daphniphyllum oldhamii, Schima superba) were sampled from selected plots in BEF-China. Samples were extracted and analysed using Liquid Chromatography-Time of Flight-Mass Spectrometry. The exudate metabolomes were normalized over their non-purgeable organic carbon level. Multivariate analyses were applied to identify the effect of both neighbouring (local) trees and plot diversity on tree metabolomes. The species and sample specific metabolites were assigned to major compound classes using the ClassyFire tool, whereas m/z features related to diversity effects were annotated manually. Individual tree species showed distinct leaf, root and root exudate metabolomes. The main compound class in leaves were the flavonoids, whereas carboxylic acids, prenol lipids and specific alkaloids were most prominent in root exudates and roots. Overall plot diversity had a stronger effect on metabolome profiles than the diversity of local, directly neighbouring trees. Leaf metabolomes responded more often to tree diversity level than exudates, whereas root metabolomes varied the least. We found not overall correlation between metabolite richness or diversity and tree diversity. Synthesis: Classification of metabolites supported initial ecological interpretation of differences among species and organs. Particularly the metabolomes of leaves and root exudates respond to differences in tree diversity. These responses were neither linear nor uniform and individual metabolites showed different dynamics. More controlled interaction experiments are needed to dissect the causes and consequences of the observed shifts in plant metabolomes.</p>",

                        "description": "<p><strong>Field location </strong></p><p>This study was carried out in the Biodiversity-Ecosystem Functioning Experiment China (BEF-China), which has been set-up and managed since 2008<strong>[1]</strong>. It is located in Jiangxi Province, China (29\u00b008\u2032\u201329\u00b011\u2032N, 117\u00b090\u2032\u2013117\u00b093\u2032E) on 2 sites, A and B, which were planted in 2009 and 2010, respectively. A former timber forest was replanted with local tree species in monoculture and mixed stands using a 'broken stick' design. Using a pool of 40 tree species, extinction scenarios were simulated with tree richness levels of <strong>1</strong>, <strong>2</strong>, <strong>4</strong>, <strong>8</strong>, <strong>16 </strong>and <strong>24 </strong>species on a total of 566 plots of 25.8 m x 25.8 m and 400 trees each. The trees are planted on a rectangular grid with 1.29 m distance. Thus, every tree has 8 potential neighbours at a distance of 1.29 m or 1.82 m (diagonal). This study was carried out on site B, which ranges in altitude from 113 to 182 m and with slopes from 15-43\u00b0. The site has a subtropical climate. From 1971-2000 the mean annual temperature was 16.7 \u00b0C and the mean annual precipitation 1,800 mm. This has increased to 17.9 \u00b0C and 2,076 mm, respectively, during 2013-2017. January is the coldest month with a mean temperature of 0.4 \u00b0C and July is the hottest with a mean temperature of 34.2 \u00b0C. The (natural) vegetation is characterized by subtropical forest with a mixture of evergreen and deciduous species.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Target tree species </strong></p><p>For our analyses, we targeted 4 different tree species planted in BEF China Site B (see <strong>Fig. S1 </strong>in the paper associated with this study). In 2018, 8 tree species pairs (TSP) consisting of 16 tree species were labelled for various diversity (1, 2, 4, 8, 16/24) analyses in the International training Network TreeDi<strong>[2]</strong>. In this study, we selected 4 of these species that had sufficient replicates (3 or more) in plots of different diversity levels. Moreover, we selected trees from different families to avoid phylogenetic bias. <strong><em>Cyclobalanopsis glauca</em></strong> (<strong>Thunb</strong>.) <strong>Oerst</strong>., (homotypic syn. of <strong><em>Quercus glauca</em> Thunb</strong>.), <strong><em>Fagaceae</em></strong>, or the 'ring-cup oak', is native to subtropical and warmer temperate zones of Asia. It contains a variety of tannins (catechins, procyanidins, gallic acids), triterpenoids, flavonoid glycosides and steroids (cycloartanols, stigmastanes)<strong>[3]-[7]</strong>. <strong><em>Schima superba </em>Gardner &amp; Champ</strong>., <strong><em>Theaceae</em></strong>, is a dominant broad leaved evergreen tree distributed over temperate Asia. Chemical analyses showed that <strong><em>Schima </em></strong>spp. contain triterpenoids and saponins as well as flavonoids and anthocyanins<strong>[8]-[15]</strong>. <strong><em>Daphniphyllum oldhamii</em></strong> (<strong>Hemsl</strong>.) <strong>K. Rosenthal</strong>, heterotypic synonym of <strong><em>Daphniphyllum pentandrum Hayata</em></strong>, <strong><em>Daphniphyllaceae</em></strong>, is native to temperate Eastern Asia. Species in the genus <strong><em>Daphniphyllum </em></strong>contain <strong><em>Daphniphyllum </em></strong>alkaloids, a diverse group of specific alkaloids with unusual ring structures (azaspirodecane derivatives) with different backbones, probably derived from squalene and mevalonate<strong>[16]</strong>. Furthermore, lignans and flavonoids have been described<strong>[17]-[23]</strong>. <strong><em>Cinnamomum camphora</em></strong> (L.) <strong>J. Presl</strong>, camphor, <strong><em>Lauraceae</em></strong>, is native to Japan and Taiwan and cultivated or naturalized in temperate and tropical regions worldwide. This plant is well known for its monoterpenoids (bicyclic, acyclic, menthane monoterpenoids, e.g. camphor, camphene, terpineol, pinene, and borneol).<strong> <em>C. amphora</em></strong><em> </em>also contains tri- and sesquiterpenoids, neolignans, steroids, benzenoids, flavonoids and oxolanes (KNApSAcK database)<strong>[24]</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Sampling design</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>The sampling took place from 19th of October until 28th of October 2019. We took our samples in the 13 plots in the BEF China experiment that contained our target species. We sampled<strong> root exudates</strong>, <strong>roots </strong>and <strong>leaves </strong>of the above-mentioned 4 tree species in plots with species richness levels <strong>1</strong>,<strong> 2</strong>, <strong>4</strong>,<strong> 8</strong>,<strong> </strong>or <strong>16(24)</strong> species. In monoculture plots (1 per species), we sampled three randomly selected trees. In 2-species plots, 4-8 replicates were sampled for each species. In plots with <strong>4</strong>,<strong> 8</strong>, <strong>16/24 </strong>species, we sampled 2-7 trees per species. The detailed sampled species combinations and sampling replicate numbers were shown in <strong>Fig S1</strong> in the paper associated with this study. In total, we sampled 84 trees, yielding 84 samples for <strong>root exudates</strong>, <strong>roots </strong>and <strong>leaves </strong>each.</p><p><br></p><p>After scrutiny of the metabolomes, it became apparent that 9 of the 84 <strong>root </strong>(<strong>exudate</strong>) samples were not from the target tree. Pre-experiments showed that under field conditions, the <strong>root </strong>excavated for <strong>exudate </strong>collection is not always originating from the target tree, even when taking all possible care. 8 of the <strong>root </strong>and <strong>root exudate</strong> samples could be reassigned to one of the other three species based on their metabolome. One sample could not be reassigned, thus, for the <strong>roots</strong>, 83 samples remained for statistical analyses, for the <strong>exudates </strong>81 (2 were lost during sample preparation) and for the <strong>leaves </strong>the complete 84.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Leaves, roots, and root exudate collection</strong></p><p>For the collection of <strong>root </strong>exudates, we followed the protocol of <strong>[25]</strong>, with slight modifications. The <strong>root </strong>exudates were collected from the middle of two trees under each combination (see <strong>Fig. S1</strong> in the paper associated with this study). We carefully excavated the <strong>roots </strong>from the upper 10 cm of mineral soil, starting from the base of the tree, to identify terminal fine root strands (&lt; 2 mm). Adhering soil particles were carefully removed with demineralized water. <strong>Roots </strong>were gently dried using paper tissue and placed into a 30 mL glass syringe, which was then filled with new, unused glass beads (500-750 \u03bcm, acid washed, ACROS Organics, ThermoFisher, New Jersey, USA/Geel, Belgium) The outlet of the glass syringe was attached to a plastic tube with a plastic 50 mL syringe attached to it. The glass syringe with the <strong>roots </strong>was filled with nutrient solution (0.50 mM NH4NO3, 0.10 mM KH2PO4, 0.20 mM K2SO4, 0.15 mM MgSO4, 0.30 mM CaCl2) from the top. The solution was sucked through the plastic syringe and discarded. The root was left to equilibrate for 20 min, after which fresh nutrient solution was added and the procedure was repeated. After this second washing step, the glass syringe was closed with cotton wool and sealed with parafilm. Everything was wrapped in aluminium foil and left for 48 h. After 48 h, the <strong>roots </strong>were cut off and the 244 syringes, which contained the <strong>root </strong>and glass beads, were placed in plastic bags and brought into the lab. In addition, randomly chosen <strong>leaves </strong>were sampled for each tree from the shaded part of the crowns. Each target tree's position and neighbourhood species were recorded at the time of sampling. These data were used to calculate neighbourhood diversity i.e. the number of species that were directly neighbouring the target tree.</p><p><br></p><p>To recover the <strong>root </strong>exudates, a 0.22 \u03bcm sterile filter was placed on a vacuum pump manifold over a 60 mL glass/plastic vial. The glass syringe with the <strong>roots </strong>and the glass beads was mounted on top of the manifold and filled with 60 mL nutrient solution. Then, the vacuum pump was started and the exudate&nbsp;solution was collected into the vial. 5 mL of the exudate solution of each sample was aliquoted for Non-Purgeable Organic Carbon (NPOC) analysis. The remaining <strong>root exudate</strong> solution was frozen at -20 \u00b0C in 60 mL HDPE cryo-vials until freeze-drying but thawed for shipment. After the collection of exudate solution, the <strong>roots </strong>were cleaned with water to remove residual glass beads. <strong>Root </strong>and <strong>leaf samples </strong>were put in envelopes, oven dried for 30 min under 105 \u00b0C, and then oven dried for 24 h under 60 \u00b0C.</p><p><br></p><p>3 mixed <strong>QCs </strong>were prepared (<strong>QC roots</strong>,<strong> QC leaves</strong>, <strong>QC exudates</strong>) and run after each 8th sample. A mix of 8 commercial standards was also run after 8 samples (<strong>MM8[1]</strong>). We used the following <strong>blanks</strong>: <strong>Injection blanks</strong> (ACN); <strong>extraction blanks </strong>(for <strong>roots and leaves</strong>, empty reaction tube; for <strong>exudates,</strong> empty reaction tubes with 1mL water and 1 mL methanol), furthermore for <strong>exudates</strong>: water and collection buffer from the field campaign stored in the polypropylene cryo vials as well as empty cryo-vials, all passed through the whole shipment, freeze-drying and exudate preparation process. <strong>Roots</strong>, <strong>leaves </strong>and <strong>exudates </strong>were prepared and measured in separate batches to avoid cross-contamination. Within the tissues, all samples were randomized throughout the complete process of processing and measurement.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1] </strong>Bruelheide H, Nadrowski K, Assmann T, Bauhus J, Both S, Buscot F, Chen X-Y, Ding B et al.

                        "description": "<p><strong>Data processing</strong></p><p>The LC-qToF-MS data were processed all together with <strong>Bruker Compass MetaboScape Mass Spectrometry Software, Version 5.0.0 </strong>(Build 683) (Bruker Daltonik GmbH, Bremen, Germany). Mass recalibration, peak picking, peak alignment, region complete feature extraction, and grouping of isotopes, adduct and charge states was performed with the T-ReX algorithm in <strong>Metaboscape</strong>. Settings: Peak detection: intensity threshold, 1000 counts, minimum peak length, 7 spectra, feature signal, intensity. Minimum peak length for recursive feature extraction, 5 spectra. Retention time range, 0-18 min. Mass range, 90-1600 <em>m/z</em>. MSMS import method, average, grouped by collision energy. Ion deconvolution: EIC correlation, 0.8, primary ion, [M+H]+, seed ions, [M+Na]+, [M+K]+, [M+NH4]+, common ions, [M+H-H2O]+. T-ReX Positive Recalibration Auto-Detect. Feature filters: Minimum number of samples: present in 3 of 302, minimum for recursive feature extraction: present in 3 of 302, group filter: present in at least 80% of at least one group (1 group = all replicates from 1 diversity level within each species and tissue). Features from Blanks were excluded when the maximum signal in samples divided by maximum signal in blanks was&nbsp;\u2264 3. Quality checks included stability of retention time and signal intensity, check for carry-over, check for correct species identity. With these settings 2 feature tables were created: 1 that classified the plant diversity around the target trees by the diversity of the experimental plot ('plot diversity') and 1 that classified it by the local neighbourhood ('local diversity'). After processing, the data set for plot diversity contained 39,077 features in total, to which 22,520 fragment spectra were assigned; 3,883 features from blanks were removed, leaving 35,194. For local diversity: total, 38,105, assigned fragment spectra 22,104; 3,649 features from blanks were excluded, leaving 34,456.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Statistical Analysis </strong></p><p>For further statistics, the feature tables were exported to <strong>Metaboanalyst 4.0[1]</strong>. For the general comparison by principal component analysis (PCA) of the species-specific metabolomes (<strong>Fig 1</strong> in the paper associated with this study, PCA) all species and tissues were analysed together. The data were IQR filtered before and Pareto scaled. Chow-Ruskey diagrams were produced with 'intervene'(<a href='https://asntech.shinyapps.io/intervene/' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>https://asntech.shinyapps.io/intervene/</a>)<strong>[2]</strong> counting a feature as 'present' when it was detected in at least 2 samples with an intensity of &gt;/= 1000. For Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) we created smaller feature tables including only the respective species and tissue metabolomes to avoid data sets with too many 0's. The date was also IQR filtered before and Pareto scaled. To group the samples in different diversity levels for PLS-DA, we used either the theoretical plot diversity or the actual local diversity. Because local diversity is maximized to 11 (See also <strong>Table S1</strong> in the paper associated with this study) and varied due to tree dieback or misplantings, some diversity levels had 2 or fewer replicates. In order to have at least n=3 per local diversity level, we grouped the samples as follows: 1 species (monoculture), 2 species, 3 or 4 species, and 5 to 7 species mixtures. In the case of<strong> </strong><em>Cy. glauca</em>, the latter two levels (3,4 and 5) had to be combined to obtain sufficient number of replicates, and there were no trees with local diversity level of 6 or 7. For <em>D. oldhamii</em>, the monoculture and 2 species samples were combined, because one of the monocultures was invaded by another tree species, leaving only 2 replicates for monocultures. To compare the data matrices, we performed multiple response permutation procedure (MRPP) with the r-package <strong>vegan </strong>(<strong>v.2.5-6</strong>; <a href='https://CRAN.R-366 project.org/package=vegan ' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>https://CRAN.R-366 project.org/package=vegan</a>) in <strong>R </strong>(<strong>version 3.6.0</strong>, (RCoreTeam, 2020)). We calculated metabolite richness as the sum of all features with an intensity &gt;1000 and metabolite diversity as the Shannon diversity of all features with an intensity &gt;1000 using the r-package <strong>vegan</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>2-way ANOVA, with species and plot or local richness as fixed factors, and Spearman's rank-order correlation of metabolite richness or Shannon index and diversity were performed with <strong>SigmaPlot 14.0 </strong>(Systat Software Inc., San Jose, CA, USA).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Compound annotation </strong></p><p>First, all fragment spectra were matched in a parallel search against the following data bases: <strong>NIST17 </strong>(The NIST Mass Spectrometry Data Center, U.S. Department of Commerce, Gaithersburg, MD, USA), <strong>MoNa </strong>(<a href='https://mona.fiehnlab.ucdavis.edu/' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>https://mona.fiehnlab.ucdavis.edu/</a>), <strong>ReSpect[3]</strong>, <strong>Riken </strong>public databases <a href='http://prime.psc.riken.jp/compms/msdial/main.html MSP' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>http://prime.psc.riken.jp/compms/msdial/main.html MSP</a>), <strong>Mass Bank EU </strong>(<a href='https://massbank.eu/MassBank/Index ' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>https://massbank.eu/MassBank/Index</a>), <strong>GNPS </strong>(<a href='https://gnps.ucsd.edu/' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>https://gnps.ucsd.edu/</a>) and an internal data base (<strong>D\u00f6ll</strong>, unpublished), using the <strong>MetaboScape </strong>Spectral Library Search function (Parameters: Filter: exact match of data base entry to precursor mass. Tolerances (narrow-wide): <em>m/z</em> 10-30 mDa, mSigma 20-100, MS/MS score 900-800) Thereafter, we performed a manual annotation of species-specific compounds with features from literature and <strong>KNApSAcK </strong>database (see 'Target tree species') based on sum formula generation (Smart Formula algorithm, <strong>MetaboScape</strong>), in-source fragmentation patterns and spectral similarities to the mentioned databases. From these manual annotations, a small spectral library was created (197 species specific compounds). This library was matched against the whole data set with the <strong>MetaboScape </strong>Spectral Library Search function without the exact match of the precursor mass to find more species specific compounds similar to the already annotated ones. For the classification approach, the whole data set was searched against <strong>NIST17 </strong>without the exact match of the precursor mass. Tolerances were as above, limitation to <strong>NIST17 </strong>was done because of computational limitations. 5. Relevant features selected after PCA (features with the highest loading on the separating principal components) or PLS-DA (20 highest VIPs variable importance in projection on the first component) were manually annotated as above.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1] </strong>Chong J, Wishart DS, Xia J.
