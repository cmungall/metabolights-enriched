                "description": "Plants, like other multicellular lifeforms, are colonized by microorganisms. How plants respond to their microbiota is currently not well understood. We used a phylogenetically diverse set of 39 endogenous bacterial strains from Arabidopsis thaliana leaves to assess host transcriptional and metabolic adaptations to bacterial encounters. We identified a molecular response, which we termed the general non-self response (GNSR) that involves the expression of a core set of 24 genes. The GNSR genes are not only consistently induced by the presence of most strains, they also comprise the most differentially regulated genes across treatments and are predictive of a hierarchical transcriptional reprogramming beyond the GNSR. Using a complementary untargeted metabolomics approach we link the GNSR to the tryptophan-derived secondary metabolism, highlighting the importance of small molecules in plant-microbe interactions. We demonstrate that several of the GNSR genes are required for resistance against the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae. Our results suggest that the GNSR constitutes a defence adaptation strategy that is consistently elicited by diverse strains from various phyla, contributes to host protection and involves secondary metabolism.",

MS analysis was carried out in positive (HILIC, C18RP) and negative FTMS mode (HILIC) at mass resolution of 30,000 (m/z = 400). Targeted and MS2 mass analysis were carried out with a Thermo QExactive plus instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at mass resolution of 35,000 (m/z = 200). A ramped collision energy of 15, 30 and 45 eV was applied in all MS2 experiments applying high-energy C-trap collision dissociation. For both instruments the same heated electrospray ionization (ESI) probe was used applying following LC method dependent source parameters (first value, HILIC; second value, C18RP): vaporizer temperature (350, 380) \u00b0C; aux gas (20, 5); ion spray voltage (+3.5, + 2.75) kV. Ion spray voltage in the negative FTMS mode was set to \u20133.0 kV. For both LC methods, following parameters were set to identical values: sheath gas, 50; sweep gas, 0; radio frequency level, 50.0; capillary temperature, 275 \u00b0C. Lastly, injected sample amount on columns was adapted to instrument sensitivity. A total 2.5 \u03bcg plant dry weight (PDW) equivalent was injected when using the LTQ Orbitrap instrument and 0.6 \u03bcg PDW when QExactive plus was used.</p>",

In a first step, individual peak libraries were constructed for each acquisition mode (same LC method and ESI mode). Briefly, after individual subtraction of blank measurements from samples, LC-MS peaks were detected and extracted sample-wise using the <strong>emzed2</strong> implemented <strong>Metabo Feature Finder</strong> from <strong>OpenMS[1]</strong>. Individual peaks of all samples were grouped on the basis of instrument-specific tolerance levels by their m/z and retention time (RT) values into unique consensus peaks and unique peak id (pID) was assigned, where each peak was represented by its mean m/z and RT value. Since compound elemental composition and applied ESI result in a multitude of signals, peak deconvolution was required. To this end, consensus peaks were further grouped by isotopologues (consensus feature IDs, fID) and subsequently, by adducts (adduct IDs, aID) taking into account peak RTs and their specific m/z differences.</p><p><br></p><p>Next, we merged the individual consensus libraries and further grouped adducts measured with the same LC method in positive and negative ESI mode on the basis of RT and specific adduct m/z differences into cross-referring IDs (crid, used as continuous numbering system). To reduce the number of low-quality entries, we removed all features on the crid level that were not detected in at least 4/5 biological replicates in at least one treatment. Remaining crid were used to perform a targeted peak extraction on samples with missing values to update missing at random 'MAR' peaks (peaks missed by feature finding algorithm). In case of complete absence (MNAR), random values were assigned from a Gaussian distribution using mean and standard values determined from sample-specific spectral baseline and noise. Finally, to each crid monoisotopic mass value(s) were assigned and crid were grouped by their masses and to each mass a unique massID was assigned to simplify database searching and possible compound overlaps between applied LC methods. The resulting mass library was used to search publically available databases (KEGG<strong>[2]-[4]</strong>, PubChem<strong>[5]</strong> and PMN<strong>[6]</strong>) to identify compounds with matching monoisotopic mass. Manual curation was used to eliminate unlikely database matches.</p><p><br></p><p>The complete emzed workflow is available at (<a href='https://gitlab.ethz.ch/emzed2-plant-metabolomics-workflows' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>https://gitlab.ethz.ch/emzed2-plant-metabolomics-workflows</a>).</p><p><br></p><p>Next, averaged group areas (weighted by individual peak areas) were calculated for each crid and treatment. Before averaging, peak areas were normalized to their individual sample total ion current area. Normalization to biomass was not required since all samples were diluted to the same biomass concentration before analysis. Differential analysis was performed by comparing the weighted average group area of crids in a treatment against those in axenic control plants (Student\u2019s t-test, Benjamini\u2013Hochberg P-value correction) and filtering for significant changes (|log2FC| &gt; 2, FDR &lt; 0.05).</p><p><br></p><p>Correlation analysis:</p><p>Gene expression count data was normalized in <strong>R v.3.5.1</strong> with the libraries <strong>edgeR v.3.24.3[7]</strong> and <strong>limma v.3.38.3[8]</strong>. Spearman correlation values were calculated for each pair of genes between their normalized expression counts across all samples. Spearman was the preferred method as it was observed that many genes showed distinct 'on' or 'off' states that produced misleading Pearson correlation values corresponding to the correlation of only the 2 states. Similarly, Spearman correlation values were calculated between each gene-metabolite pair between the normalized expression count and log2-normalized crid area respectively.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> R\u00f6st HL, Sachsenberg T, Aiche S, Bielow C, Weisser H, Aicheler F, Andreotti S et al.
