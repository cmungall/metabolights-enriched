                "description": "<p>Vitis labrusca L. grapes are largely cultivated in Brazil, but the tropical climate affect negatively the phenols content, especially anthocyanin. Therefore, researches are focusing on increase grape phenols content; with methyl jasmonate application (MeJa) considered a good alternative. </p><p>The aim was to investigate with an untargeted approach the metabolic changes caused by the MeJa pre-harvest application on two Vitis labrusca L. cultivars grape, both grown in two Brazilian regions. Isabel Precoce and Concord grapes cultivated under subtropical climate, on south and southeast of Brazil, received MeJa pre-harvest treatment. Grape metabolome was extracted and analyzed with a MS based metabolomics protocol by UPLC-HRMS-QTOF. Unsupervised data analysis reveal clear separation between the two regions and the two cultivars, while supervised data analysis revealed biomarkers between MeJa and control group. Between the biomarkers, stilbenes, hydrocinnamates, flavonols and anthocyanins were identified. These results suggest that MeJa can be used as elicitor to secondary metabolism in grapes grown even under subtropical climate, affecting phenolic biosynthesis.</p>",

In the south, the experiments were done in Bento Gon\u00e7alves (29\u00b0 10\u2032 26\u2033 S e 51\u00b0 31\u2032 7\u2033 W, 671 meters altitude) in a 5-year-old commercial vineyard of Isabel Precoce grapes and a 20 year-old vineyard of Concord (Fig.1A of associated publication). Both vines trained on tendone system with a between row and within-row spacing of 2.8 \u00d7 1.5 m, respectively. In southeast, the experiment were conducted in Caldas (21\u00b0 55\u2019 23\u2019\u2019 S e 46\u00b0 23\u2019 15\u2019\u2019 W, 1.131 meters altitude), in 7-year-old vineyard of Isabel Precoce and Concord trained on vertical shoot positioning system with a between-row and within-row spacing of 2.5 \u00d7 1.5 m. Weather conditions, were recorded by a meteorological station and the data collected from Instituto Nacional de Meteorologia (http://www.inmet.gov.br/portal/). For each region/cultivar two blocks were used, control versus treatment. For the south region, each block comprised 10 vines, while for southeast 18 vines. Each plant represented a biological replicate. The MeJa solution was prepared according to Vezzulli et al. [1], at a concentration of 10 mM of MeJa dissolved in water. Approximately 50 ml of treated solution were applied by spraying at veraison with tree applications (at days 1, 3, and 6) plus a single application approximately 2 weeks before harvest (approximately 15,5\u00b0 Brix), water was used for control (CtRl) group (Fig. 1B of associated publication). The treatments it were applied at least 2 hours before rain. The harvest was performed at technical maturation. For untargeted analysis from 6 to 8 vines were analyzed for each condition/variety/region; 20 berries per vine were sampled, frozen and lyophilized (STOKES, USA). The lyophilized samples were transport to Italy, grounded using an analytical mill (IKA, Germany), and storage at -80 until analysis.</p><p><br></p><p>References:</p><p>[1] Vezzulli et al. 2007</p>",

The UPLC conditions were developed based in an in house previous published method [1][2] and small changes were made in order to have a shorter chromatographic run and smaller back pressures. All samples were analysed on a reversed phase (RP) ACQUITY UPLC 1.8 \u00b5m 2.1 x 150 mm HSS T3 column (Waters) protected with an Acquity UPLC HSS T3 1.8 \u00b5m, 2.1 x 5 mm precolumn (Waters), at 40 \u00b0C and under a mobile phase flow rate of 0.28 ml/min. Water was used as weak eluting solvent (A) and methanol as strong elution solvent (B); formic acid 0.1% v/v was used as additive in both eluents. The multistep linear gradient used was as follows: 0-1 min, 100% A isocratic; 1-3 min, 100-90% A linear; 3-18 min, 90-60% A linear; 18-21 min, 60-0% A linear; 21-25.5 min, 0% A isocratic; 25.5-25.6 min, 0-100% A linear; 25.6-28 min 100% isocratic. Injection volume was 10 \u00b5l, unless otherwise stated, and the samples were kept at 4 \u00baC throughout the analysis. </p><p><br></p><p>References: </p><p>[1] Arapitsas, P., Perenzoni, D., Nicolini, G., &amp; Mattivi, F.

Mass spectrometric data were collected by different runs in positive and negative ESI mode over a mass range of 50 to 2000 amu with scan duration of 0.3 s in centroid mode. The transfer collision energy and trap collision energy were set at 6 V and 4 V. The source parameters were set as follows: capillary 3 kV for positive scan and 2.5 kV for negative scan, sampling cone 25 V, extraction cone 3V, source temperature 150 \u00baC, desolvation temperature 500 \u00baC, desolvation gas flow 1000 l/h and nebulizer gas 50 l/h. External calibration of the instrument was performed at the beginning of each batch of analysis by direct infusion of a sodium formate solution (10% formic acid/0.1 M NaOH/Acetonitrile at a ratio of 1/1/8) by controlling the mass accuracy from 40 to 2000 m/z (less than 5 ppm) and mass resolution (over 14000 FWHM). LockMass calibration was applied using a solution of leucine enkephaline (0.5 mg/l, m/z 556.2771 for positive and 554.2620 for negative ion mode) at 0.1 ml/min.",
