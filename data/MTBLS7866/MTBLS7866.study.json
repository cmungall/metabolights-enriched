                "description": "<p>The intestinal microflora and metabolites produced by these microbes serve as important regulators of the development of sepsis. Accordingly, this study was designed to systematically explore the relationships between the regulation of septicemia and both the intestinal flora and fecal metabolites by examining the functional roles of metabolites in the protection against sepsis-associated&nbsp;intestinal damage. To that end, fecal and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples were collected from sepsis patients and healthy controls. A series of longitudinal multi-omics analyses were then used to assess the links between the intestinal flora or associated metabolites and PBMCs in sepsis patients, while animal model studies were further used to probe the protective effects of intestinal flora-derived metabolites on intestinal damage and immunity in the context of sepsis. These analyses revealed that intestinal dysbiosis was a common finding in sepsis patients, which&nbsp;commonly exhibited higher levels of deleterious bacteria and/or reductions in beneficial bacteria. A machine learning approach was used to identify samples from sepsis patients, revealing that at the genus level, sepsis samples could be distinguished by the presence of Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, Porphyromonas, Prevotell, Enterococcus, Anaerococcus and Veillonella&nbsp;species. Metabolomics analyses indicated&nbsp;that there were significant differences in the levels&nbsp;of intestinal flora-derived metabolites including&nbsp;L-serine, L-valine and L-tyrosine when comparing samples from the sepsis and control groups, while corresponding transcriptomic analyses of PBMC samples using an ImmunecellAI analytical approach revealed a significant sepsis-related increase in the abundance of T cells and Th17 cells. Single-cell sequencing data from sepsis-associated PBMCs was also downloaded from the GEO database, confirming the observation that Th17 cell levels and those of other immune cells rose significantly in the context of septicemia. Animal model&nbsp;experiments&nbsp;revealed&nbsp;that intestinal microbiota-derived L-valine was able to alleviate inflammation and protest against sepsis-induced intestinal damage by inhibiting Th17 cell activation. Overall, these results thus highlight the successful application of machine learning to distinguish between sepsis and control samples based on the composition of the intestinal flora while demonstrating the&nbsp;potential therapeutic benefits of L-valine as an inhibitor of Th17 cell&nbsp;activity that may offer value as a means of alleviating or preventing intestinal damage in treated individuals.&nbsp;</p>",

The metabolites were identified by accuracy mass (&lt;\u200930 ppm) and MS/MS data which were matched with HMDB (http://www.hmdb.ca), MassBank (http://www.massbank.jp/), LIPIDMAPS (http://www.lipidmaps.org), mzCloud (https://www.mzcloud.org) and KEGG (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/). The robust LOESS signal correction (QC-RLSC) was applied for data normalization to correct for any systematic bias. After normalization, only ion peaks with relative standard deviations (RSDs) &lt; 30% in QC were kept to ensure proper metabolite identification.</p><p><br></p><p>The Ropls software was used for all multivariate data analyses and modelings. Data were mean-centered using scaling. Models were built on principal component analysis (PCA), orthogonal partial least-square discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) and partial least-square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). The metabolic profiles could be visualized as score plot where each point represents a sample. The corresponding loading plot and S-plot were generated to provide information on the metabolites that influence clustering of the samples. All the models evaluated were tested for over fitting with methods of permutation tests. The descriptive performance of the models was determined by R2X cumulative (perfect model: R2X (cum)\u2009=\u20091) and R2Y cumulative (perfect model: R2Y (cum)\u2009=\u20091) values while their prediction performance was measured by Q2 cumulative (perfect model: Q2 (cum)\u2009=\u20091) and a permutation test. The permuted model should not be able to predict classes: R2 and Q2 values at the Y-axis intercept must be lower than those of Q2 and the R2 of the non-permuted model. OPLS-DA allowed the determination of discriminating metabolites using the variable importance on projection (VIP). The p-value, Variable importance projection (VIP) produced by OPLS-DA, fold change (FC) was applied to discover the contributable-variable for classification. Finally, p-value \uff1c 0.05 and VIP values \uff1e 1 were considered to be statistically significant metabolites.</p><p><br></p><p>Differential metabolites were subjected to pathway analysis by MetaboAnalyst, which combines results from powerful pathway enrichment analysis with the pathway topology analysis. The identified metabolites in metabolomics were then mapped to the KEGG pathway for biological interpretation of higher-level systemic functions.
