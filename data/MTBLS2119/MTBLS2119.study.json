                "description": "Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a eukaryotic model organism widely used for the investigation of fundamental cellular processes and disease mechanisms. Consequently, the lipid landscape of yeast has been extensively investigated and up to this day the lipidome is considered as rather basic. Here, we used a nLC/NSI-MS/MS method combined with a semi-autonomous data analysis workflow for an in-depth evaluation of the steady state yeast lipidome. We identified close to 900 lipid species across 26 lipid classes, including glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, glycerolipids and sterol lipids. Most lipid classes are dominated by few high abundant species, with a multitude of lower abundant lipids contributing to the overall complexity of the yeast lipidome. Contrary to previously published datasets, odd-chain and diunsaturated fatty acyl moieties were found to be commonly incorporated in multiple lipid classes. Careful data evaluation furthermore revealed the presence of putative new lipid species such as MMPSs (mono-methylated phosphatidylserine), not yet described in yeast. Overall, our analysis achieved a more than 4-fold increase in lipid identifications compared to previous approaches, underscoring the use of nLC/NSI-MS/MS methods for the in-depth investigation of lipidomes.",

For the lipid extraction, the yeast suspension was thawed on ice and diluted to 1.3 x 10^9 cells/\u03bcl with 150 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer. Cells were counted using a Thoma cell counting chamber. 250 \u03bcl glass beads (Sigma Aldrich, St. Luis, USA) were added to 500 \u03bcl aliquots of cell suspension (approx. 6.7 x 10^8 cells) and cell disruption was carried out using the TissueLyser (Qiagen, Venlo, Netherlands) with precooled reaction tube racks (-20 \u00b0C) at a frequency of 20 Hz for a period of 30 min. Subsequently, 400 \u03bcl of the disrupted yeast suspension and 1980 \u03bcl of a CHCl3:MeOH (17:1) mixture were added to a 5 ml polypropylene tube. For the first extraction step, the extraction suspension was shaken for 2 h at 4 \u00b0C and 750 rpm on a Thermomixer comfort (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). The aqueous upper phase was then separated from the lower chloroform containing organic phase by centrifugation at 8000 RCF for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C. The primary organic phase, containing mostly unpolar lipid classes<strong>[2]</strong>, was removed and stored at -20 \u00b0C in a polypropylene microreaction tube. The upper phase (containing polar metabolites) and the interphase, where cell debris and proteins were accumulating, were re-extracted in the second extraction cycle with 990 \u03bcl CHCl3:MeOH (2:1 (v/v)) to increase the recovery of polar lipid classes. Again, the extract was agitated for 2 h at 750 rpm and 4 \u00b0C and phase separation was induced by centrifugation for 10 min (4 \u00b0C) at 8000 RCF. The secondary organic phase was combined with the primary extract to yield 1 extraction replicate. 3 extraction replicates were pooled, nitrogen-evaporated and re-dissolved in 200 \u00b5l 1-BuOH:IPA:H2O 8:23:69 (v/v/v) + 5 mM H3PO4.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Ejsing CS, Sampaio JL, Surendranath V, Duchoslav E, Ekroos K, Klemm RW, Simons K, Shevchenko A.

Lipids and their associated mass spectra were annotated according to a previously described method<strong>[3]</strong>. LUX score analysis was performed according to the previously published protocol<strong>[4]</strong>. Lipids were identified based on different criteria like (1) exact MS1 precursor mass (&lt; 3 ppm), (2) class characteristic MS2 fragments with high mass accuracy (&lt; 5 ppm), (3) presence of the lipid species in both positive and negative mode, (4) class-specific elution patterns and (5) class-specific adduct distribution.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Peng B, Kopczynski D, Pratt BS, Ejsing CS, Burla B, Hermansson M, Benke PI, Tan SH, Chan MY, Torta F, Schwudke D, Meckelmann SW, Coman C, Schmitz OJ, MacLean B, Manke MC, Borst O, Wenk MR, Hoffmann N, Ahrends R.
