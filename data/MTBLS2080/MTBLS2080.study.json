                "description": "<p>The bacterial lipid membrane, consisting both of fatty acid (acyl) tails and polar head groups, responds to changing conditions through alteration of either the acyl tails and/or head groups. This plasticity is critical for cell survival as it allows maintenance of both the protective nature of the membrane as well as functioning membrane protein complexes. Bacteria that live in fatty-acid rich environments, such as those found in the human host, can exploit host fatty acids to synthesize their own membranes, in turn, altering their physiology. Enterococcus faecalis is such an organism that is a commensal of the mammalian intestine where it is exposed to fatty-acid rich bile, as well as a major cause of hospital infections during which it is exposed to serum that contains numerous fatty acids. Within, we employed a targeted approach to detect the most common phospholipid species within the membrane of E. faecalis OG1RF via ultra-high performance liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry (UPLC-HRMS). We examined not only how the composition responds upon exposure to host fatty acids but also how deletion of genes predicted to synthesize the major polar head groups impacted lipid composition. Regardless of genetic background and differing basal lipid composition, all strains were able to alter their lipid composition upon exposure to individual host fatty acids. Specific gene deletion strains, however, had altered survival to membrane damaging agents. Combined, the enterococcal lipidome is highly resilient in response to both genetic and environmental perturbation, likely contributing to stress survival.</p>",

The supernatants were removed and the remaining pellets were washed with 15 ml of PBS and stored in conical vials at -80 \u00b0C prior to lipid extraction. Lipids were extracted using a previously published method<strong>[1]</strong> with modifications. Briefly, pellets were brought to room temperature and resuspended in 5 ml of extraction solvent (95% ethanol, water, diethyl ether, pyridine, 4.2 N ammonium hydroxide; 15:15:5:1:0.18). Glass beads were added and cells were vortexed for 30 s before being heated at 60 \u00b0C for 1 h. After incubation, the organic solvent was removed via pipetting and placed in a respectively labeled glass dram vial, leaving glass beads behind. An additional 5 ml of extraction buffer was added to the vial, contents were vortexed and incubated for another hour at 60 \u00b0C. At this time, the organic extracts were combined and dried under a stream N2. The resulting solids were resuspended in 300 \u03bcl of 9:1 methanol:chloroform and stored at -20 \u00b0C until UHPLC-HRMS analysis.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Guan XL, Riezman I, Wenk MR, Riezman H.

Mass analysis was performed using an Exactive Plus (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) mass spectrometer operated in dual polarity mode. Ions of respective DAG and MGDG species were detected in positive mode while free fatty acids, PG, L-PG, and CL were detected in negative mode. Masses were detected in full scan mode within a scan range of 100-1500 m/z, operated at a resolution of 140,000, with an automatic gain control target of (AGC) of 3 x 10^6 ions, and a maximum IT time of 100 ms. Full scan data was complemented with all ion fragmentation data at a resolution of 35,000 utilizing 35 eV collisional energy. The mass spectrometer was calibrated every 24 h.</p>",

The integrated intensities were normalized to the optical density (OD600 nm) of the culture at the time of extraction. A Grubbs' test was utilized to exclude any outliers within the biological replicates in the data set. An alpha value of 1.67 was chosen for the Grubbs test to represent a confidence interval of 95%. After Grubbs analysis, outliers residing outside the 95% confidence interval were removed; the average peak area, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation were then calculated. Any remaining data points with a representative coefficient variation greater than 30% were removed to aid in confirmation of presented data. Heatmaps were constructed by determining the ratio of normalized, log-transformed intensities of experimental values over control values. A paired student's t-test was utilized to determine significance. 3 dots denote P-value &lt; 0.01; 2 dots indicate P-value between 0.01-0.05; 1 dot, P-value between 0.05-0.1. In order to ensure the P-values were not contributing to a high false discovery rates, data was inputted into Metaboanalyst (<a href='https://www.metaboanalyst.ca/' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>https://www.metaboanalyst.ca/</a>) and analyzed via 1-way <strong>ANOVA</strong> and <em>post-hoc</em> tests.
