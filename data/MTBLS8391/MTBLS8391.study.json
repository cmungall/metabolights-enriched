                "description": "<p>Exercise enhances physical performance and reduces the risk of many disorders such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, dementia and cancer. Exercise characteristically incites an inflammatory response, notably in skeletal muscles. While some effector mechanisms have been identified, regulatory elements activated in response to exercise remain obscure. Here, we have addressed the roles of Foxp3+CD4+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) in the healthful activities of exercise via immunologic, transcriptomic, histologic, metabolic and biochemical analyses of acute and chronic murine exercise models. Exercise rapidly induced expansion of the muscle Treg compartment, thereby guarding against over-exuberant production of interferon gamma and consequent metabolic disruptions, particularly mitochondrial aberrancies. Importantly, the performance-enhancing effects of exercise training were dampened in the absence of Tregs. Thus, exercise is a natural Treg booster with therapeutic potential in disease and aging contexts.</p>",

                        "description": "<p><strong>Study design</strong></p><p>The major aims of this study were threefold: 1) to map the dynamics of exercise-induced inflammation in skeletal muscle to its transcriptional, metabolic and functional responses; 2) to identify key regulatory elements involved in these processes; 3) to elucidate the impact of loss of regulation on the benefits of exercise. To these ends, we performed immunologic, transcriptomic, histologic, metabolic and biochemical analyses of acute and chronic murine exercise models coupled with Treg ablation and modulation IFN-gamma signaling.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Mice</strong></p><p>All mice were maintained under SPF conditions at Harvard Medical School (HMS) facilities in accordance with Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines (IS00001257). C57BL/6J, Foxp3-DTR, D2.B10-Dmdmdx/J, B6.FVB(129S4)-Tg(Ckmm-cre)5Khn/J (MCK-Cre) and C57BL/6N-Ifngr1tm1.1Rds/J (Ifngrf) mice were originally purchased from Jackson Laboratory, and mice were bred and maintained in-house before males between 8-10 weeks of age were used in experiments. All experiments using these strains were conducted with littermate controls.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Exercise</strong></p><p>For acute exercise and exercise-capacity testing, mice were acclimatized to a motorized treadmill (Columbus Instruments, Exer 3/6 Treadmill) for 2 consecutive days, followed by a full bout at least 24 h later. Treadmill running began between Zeitgeber time (ZT) 0 and 1, and concluded before ZT4 to minimize circadian disruption. For acute exercise, a 5 min warmup at 6 m/min was followed by a step-wise acceleration of 2 m/min every 2 min; the treadmill belt speed was capped at 18 m/min and sustained for 90 min. For exercise capacity testing, mice went through a similar warmup, and the treadmill belt speed was sustained between 26-32 m/min (segmented into 40 min stages with 2 m/min jumps) until mice reached exhaustion, which was defined as inability to remain on the treadmill belt for more than 5 s. Change in work was calculated as done previously<strong>[1]</strong>. For exercise training, mice were housed individually in cages equipped with running-wheels (Columbus Instruments, Home Cage Running Wheel). Voluntary wheel running was recorded at intervals of 10 s using software from the running-wheels manufacturer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Metabolite profiling</strong></p><p>Quadriceps muscles (around 200 mg fresh weight) were isolated from 10-week-old mice. Tissues were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen while flattened into an aluminium foil sleeve and stored in -80 \u00b0C until homogenisation. In the morning of homogenisation &amp; metabolite extraction, tissue fresh weight was determined. Samples were weighed and homogenized in 0.5 mL of extraction solvent (70% ethanol spiked with 1 uM of U-13C6 glucose [Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, CLM-1396-PK] and unlabeled caffeine [Sigma-Aldrich, PHR1009] for internal standards) in screw-cap microcentrifuge tubes at 10 \u00b0C in a Precellys Evolution homogenizer (Bertin technologies) using metallic beads. Metabolites were extracted from homogenates by addition of 7 mL of extraction solvent at 70 \u00b0C for 1 min with occasional vortexing to ensure complete extraction.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Handschin C, Chin S, Li P, Liu F, Maratos-Flier E, Lebrasseur NK, Yan Z, Spiegelman BM.

Mobile phase A was 15 mM ammonium bicarbonate in 90% water and 10% acetonitrile, and mobile phase B was 15 mM ammonium bicarbonate in 95% acetonitrile and 5% water. The column oven was held at 45 \u00b0C and autosampler at 4 \u00b0C.
