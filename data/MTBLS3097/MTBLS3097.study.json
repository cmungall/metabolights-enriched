                "description": "<p>MAVEN, an open-source software program for analysis of LC-MS metabolomics data, was originally released in 2010. As mass spectrometry has advanced in the intervening years, MAVEN has been periodically updated to reflect this advancement. This manuscript describes a major update to the program, MAVEN2, which supports LC-MS/MS analysis of metabolomics and lipidomics samples. We have developed algorithms to support MS/MS spectral matching and efficient search of large-scale fragmentation libraries. We explore the ability of our approach to separate authentic from spurious metabolite identifications using a set of standards spiked into water and yeast backgrounds. To support our improved lipid identification workflow, we introduce a novel <em>in-silico</em> lipidomics library covering major lipid classes and compare searches using our novel library to searches with existing <em>in-silico</em> lipidomics libraries. MAVEN2 source code and cross-platform application installers are freely available for download from GitHub under a GNU permissive license [ver 3], as are the in silico lipidomics libraries and corresponding code repository.</p>",

These 25 pools were combined together in different ways to form \u201csuper pools\u201d. In total, 10 super pools were generated. Each pool was added to at least 2 different super pools.

Libraries were created by summing the spectra from the 3 relevant energies (20, 40, and 80 NCE settings in positive mode, and 20, 50, and 100 NCE in negative mode) to match the data acquisition, using stepped collision energies.

Please see the associated manuscript for more details.</p><p><br></p><p>Briefly, <strong>MAVEN2</strong> implements <strong>MS/MS</strong>-based slicing, construction of consensus spectra, and spectral library matching (see <strong>Fig. 1A</strong> in the paper associated with this study). <strong>MS/MS</strong> scans collected in an <strong>LC/MS</strong> run are used as seeds for formation of \u201cslices\u201d i.e. blocks in m/z and retention time (RT) space surrounding the <strong>MS/MS</strong> scan\u2019s precursor m/z (see <strong>Fig. 1B</strong> in the paper associated with this study). Slices from all samples are then merged based on overlaps in m/z or RT space&nbsp;(see <strong>Fig. 1C</strong> in the paper associated with this study). These merged slices are used to generate extracted ion chromatograms (EICs) and summed to form a merged EIC. Peak groups are defined by overlapping regions of intensity in merged EIC. The peaks picked from individual sample EICs are then associated with their corresponding peak groups (see <strong>Fig. 1D</strong> in the paper associated with this study). <strong>MS/MS</strong> Spectra corresponding to a peak group are combined to form a consensus spectrum, which is then searched against spectral libraries to identify compounds (see <strong>Fig. 1E</strong> in the paper associated with this study). This approach allows for annotation of peaks in samples even when no <strong>MS/MS</strong> spectra were collected.</p>",
