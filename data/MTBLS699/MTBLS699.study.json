                "description": "Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) is a model crop for studying development regulation and ripening in flesh fruits and vegetables. Supplementary light to maintain the optimal light environment can lead to the stable growth of tomatoes in greenhouses and areas without sufficient daily light integral. Technological advances in genome-wide molecular phenotyping have dramatically enhanced our understanding of metabolic shifts in the plant metabolism across tomato fruit development. However, comprehensive metabolic and transcriptional behaviors along the developmental process under supplementary light provided by light-emitting diodes (LED) remain to be fully elucidated. We present integrative omic approaches to identify the impact on the metabolism of a single tomato plant leaf exposed to red LEDs of different intensities during the fruit development stage. Our special light delivery system, the \u201csimplified source-sink model\u201d, involves the exposure of a single leaf below the second truss to red LED light of different intensities. We evaluated fruit-size- and fruit-shape variations elicited by different light intensities. Our findings suggest that more than high-light treatment (500 mmol/m^2/s) with the red LED light is required to accelerate fruit growth for 2 weeks after anthesis. To investigate transcriptomic and metabolomic changes in leaf- and fruit samples we used microarray-, RNA sequencing-, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry techniques. We found that metabolic shifts in the carbohydrate metabolism and in several key pathways contributed to fruit development, including ripening and cell-wall modification. Our findings suggest that the proposed workflow aids in the identification of key metabolites in the central metabolism that respond to monochromatic red-LED treatment and contribute to increase the fruit size of tomato plants. This study expands our understanding of systems-level responses mediated by low-, appropriate-, and high levels of red light irradiation in the fruit growth of tomato plants.",

                        "description": "Details on plant growth and harvest can be found in our earlier reports[1][2]. The experiments were performed at Chiba University, Japan. Briefly, we exposed single leaves to red LED light and investigated changes in the metabolite- and transcript level of leaves and fruits grown under different light intensities. For LED irradiation, we exposed single leaves for 3 weeks to a red LED panel (23 cm x 12 cm, 18 W, Shibasaki Inc., Saitama, Japan); the peak wavelength was 660 nm (Showa Denko K. K., Tokyo, Japan).\n</p>\nSeeds from tomato (Solanum lycopersicum \u2018Reiyo\u2019) were sown in 72-cell trays (Takii Seed, Kyoto, Japan) and grown in a soil mix (Napura Soil Mixes) for 2 weeks in a growth chamber (MKV DREAM, Tokyo, Japan) at 25 \u00b0C/20 \u00b0C (light/dark) and 900 \u03bcl/l CO2 concentration. The light/dark cycle was 16 h/8 h for 2 weeks. Then the seedlings were transferred to 2.4 l pots and grown in a growth chamber (Asahi Kogyosha); the photosynthetic photon flux (PPF) level was adjusted to 450 - 500 \u03bcmol/m^2/s when measurements were at the meristem of each tomato plant (light source: ceramic metal halide lamps). After plant flowering in the summer of 2010, excluding the second, a leaf below the second truss, and the meristem[2], all leaves and trusses were removed from each plant. LED irradiation at PPF 0, 200, 500, and 1,000 \u03bcmol/m^2/s was directly applied to the leaf using our plant irradiation system (humidity 70%, CO2 concentration 900 \u03bcl/l). Plant material was harvested on days 0 and 1, and 2 weeks after light irradiation. All samples were frozen within 30 s after sampling in liquid nitrogen. The frozen samples were lyophilized.\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Fukushima A, Nishizawa T, Hayakumo M, Hikosaka S, Saito K, Goto E, Kusano M.

Tomato fruit samples were extracted with 2.0 mg/ml (dried weight) and (CHCl3:MeOH:H2O 2:6:2 v/v/v) as extraction medium including 10 stable isotope reference compounds.\n</p>\nThe 10 stable isotope reference compounds: [2H4]-succinic acid, [13C5,15N]-glutamic acid, [2H7]-cholesterol, [13C3]-myristic acid, [13C5]-proline, [13C12]-sucrose, [13C4]-hexadecanoic acid, [2H4]-1,4-butanediamine, [2H6]-2-hydoxybenzoic acid and [13C6]-glucose were combined using a Retsch mixer mill MM301 at a frequency of 15 Hz for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C. Each isotope compound was adjusted to a final concentration of 15 ng/\u03bcl for each 1-\u03bcl injection. After centrifugation for 5 min at 15,100 x g, a 200-\u03bcl aliquot of the supernatant was drawn and transferred into a glass insert vial. The extracts were evaporated to dryness in an SPD2010 SpeedVacR concentrator from ThermoSavant (Thermo electron corporation, Waltham, MA, USA).\n</p>\nFor methoximation, 30 \u03bcl of methoxyamine hydrochloride (20 mg/ml in pyridine) was added to the sample. After 24 h of derivatization at room temperature, the sample was trimethylsilylated for 1 h using 30 \u03bcl of MSTFA with 1% TMCS at 37 \u00b0C with shaking. 30 \u03bcl of n-heptane was added following silylation. All the derivatization steps were performed in the vacuum glove box VSC-1000 (Sanplatec, Japan) filled with 99.9995% (G3 grade) of dry nitrogen.",
