                "description": "<p>Objective: The gut microbiome plays a pivotal role in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. However, the associated alterations in the gut microbiome-host interaction remain unclear. This study aims to investigate the gut microbiota and fecal metabolites in people living with HIV (PLWH).</p><p>Method: We collected stool samples from 70 PLWH and 34 healthy controls (HCs) and performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Metabolite analysis was conducted using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.</p><p>Results: Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteriota, and Bacteroidota were the most abundant phyla in both groups. At the genus level, Escherichia Shigella was significantly upregulated in the PLWH group, whereas Bacteroides were upregulated in the HC group. Functional prediction of the microbiota indicated significant reductions in alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism, as well as histidine metabolism. Furthermore, comparison of fecal metabolites between the HC and PLWH groups identified 38 differentially abundant metabolites across four enriched human metabolic pathways. Spearman correlation analysis revealed close relationships between four differentially abundant microbiota members and five differentially abundant fecal metabolites, which may influence specific human metabolic pathways.</p><p>Conclusion: Our findings provide a foundation for further experimental investigations into the contribution of the gut microbiota and its associated metabolites to HIV/AIDS, offering a novel perspective for future studies on HIV/AIDS.</p>",

The flow rate and injection volume were set at 0.3 mL/min and 2 \u03bcL, respectively. For LC-ESI (+)-MS analysis, the mobile phases consisted of (B2) 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile (v/v) and (A2) 0.1% formic acid in water (v/v). Separation was conducted under the following gradient: 0.0-1.0 min, 8% B2; 1.0-8.0 min, 8-98% B2; 8.0-10.0 min, 98% B2; 10.0-10.1 min, 98-8% B2; 10.1-12.0 min, 8% B2. For LC-ESI (-)-MS analysis, the analytes were carried out with (B3) acetonitrile and (A3) ammonium formate (5 mM).

The 3D matrix includes sample information, the name of the peak of each substance, retention time, retention index, mass-to-charge ratio and signal intensity. In each sample, all peak signal intensities were segmented and normalized according to the internal standards with RSD greater than 0.1 after screening.
