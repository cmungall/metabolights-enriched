                "description": "In Europe, synthetic corticosteroids are not allowed in animal breeding fro growth-promoting purposes. Nevertheless, a high prevalence of non-compliant urine samples was recently reported for prednisolone, however, without any indication of unauthorized use. Within this context, 20b-dihydroprednisolone and the prednisolone/cortisol ratio have been suggested as potential tools to discriminate between exogenous and endogenous urinary prednisolone.</br> In this study, the validity of these strategies was verified by investigating the urinary excretion profiles of relevant glucocorticoids in bovines, subjected to either 1) exogenous prednisolone treatment per os (PO), 2) exogenous prednisolone treatment by intra-muscular injection (IM), 3) tetracosactide hexaacetate (ACTH) to induce endogenous prednisolone formation, and 4) animals at slaughter to simulate natural stress conditions. For treatments the exogenous treatments, both growth-promoting and therapeutic prednisolone doses were considered. Bovine urine samples were analysed by liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry.",

Separation of the glucocorticoids was carried out on a reverse phase Nucleodur C18 Isis U-HPLC column (1.8 m, 100 mm, 2 mm) (Macherey-Nagel, D\u00fcren, Germany) at a column oven temperature of 30 \u00b0C. The elution gradient was carried out with a binary solvent system consisting of 0.1% aqueous formic acid (A) and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile (B) at a constant flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. Optimized separation of all analytes was obtained using a linear gradient starting with a solvent mixture (v/v) of 75% A and 25% B, which was held for 4.0 min. The percentage of acetonitrile was increased to 95% in 0.1 min, and further to 100% in 1.4 min and held there for 2.0 min. Between samples, the column was allowed to re-equilibrate at initial conditions for 1.5 min. A 10 l aliquot of each sample was injected for analysis.",
