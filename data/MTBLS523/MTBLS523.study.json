                "description": "Immunity to intestinal helminth infections has been well studied, but the mechanism of helminth killing prior to expulsion remains unclear. Here we identify epithelial-cell-derived phospholipase A2 group 1B (PLA2g1B) as a host-derived endogenous anthelmintic. PLA2g1B is elevated in resistant mice and is responsible for killing tissue-embedded larvae. Despite comparable activities of other essential type-2-dependent immune mechanisms, Pla2g1b-/- mice failed to expel the intestinal helminths Heligmosomoides polygyrus or Nippostrongylus brasiliensis. Expression of Pla2g1b by epithelial cells was dependent upon intestinal microbiota, adaptive immunity, and common-gamma chain-dependent signaling. Notably, Pla2g1b was downregulated in susceptible mice and inhibited by IL-4R-signaling in vitro, uncoupling parasite killing from expulsion mechanisms. Resistance was restored in Pla2g1b-/- mice by treating infective H. polygyrus L3 larvae with PLA2g1B, which reduced larval phospholipid abundance. These findings uncover epithelial-cell-derived Pla2g1b as an essential mediator of helminth killing, highlighting a previously overlooked mechanism of anti-helminth immunity.",

Briefly, following PLA2g1B treatment ~8000 H. polygyrus larvae were washed 3 times with MilliQ water, resuspended in 2 ml methanol and heated in a sealed tube under nitrogen at 55 \u00b0C for 20 min. After cooling, 4 ml chloroform was added and the sample was agitated with a magnetic stirrer for 3 hr. The organic phase was removed and the residue ground (using a glass homogenizer) and extracted with 2 ml chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) for 2 hr.\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Meyer F, Kimura S, Mueller JF.

Both the sheath gas and the auxiliary gas were nitrogen. The parameters of the full mass scan were as follows: a resolution of 70,000, an auto gain control target under 3 x 10^6, a maximum isolation time of 200 ms, and an m/z range 200\u20133000. To confirm the identification of significant features, samples were re-ran in PRM (parallel reaction monitoring) mode on a Thermo Q-Excative Orbitrap MS. Parameters as follows: a resolution of 17,500, an auto gain control target under 2 x 10^5, a maximum isolation time of 100 ms, an isolation window of m/z 0.4 and normalized collision energy were optimized for each feature individually.",
