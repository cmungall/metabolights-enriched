                "description": "Liver cirrhosis is one of the leading causes of decreased life expectancy worldwide. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of liver cirrhosis remain unclear. In this study, we performed a comprehensive analysis using transcriptome and metabolome sequencing to explore the genes, pathways, and interactions associated with liver cirrhosis. We performed transcriptome and metabolome sequencing of blood samples from patients with cirrhosis and healthy controls (1:1 matched for sex and age). For transcriptome analysis, we screened for differentially expressed miRNAs and mRNAs, analyzed mRNAs to identify possible core genes and pathways, and performed co-analysis of miRNA and mRNA sequencing results. And we validated differentially expressed microRNA (miRNA) and mRNAs using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. In terms of the metabolome, we screened five pathways that were substantially enriched in the differential metabolites. Next, we identified the metabolites with the most pronounced differences among these five metabolic pathways. We performed receiver operating characteristic curve analysis of these five metabolites to determine their diagnostic efficacy for cirrhosis. Finally, we explored possible links between the transcriptome and metabolome. Using a systems biology framework, We identified miRNAs and mRNAs that were differentially expressed in the blood of cirrhotic patients and healthy controls. And explored associated pathways as well as disease-specific networks. Additionally, We identified possible common pathways in the transcriptome and metabolome that can reveal coherent changes in cirrhosis from the transcriptional level to the metabolic level, which can be further studied from multiple perspectives.",

Metabolite extraction was primarily performed according to previously reported methods<strong>[1][2]</strong>. After the samples were slowly thawed at 4 \u00b0C, 100 \u03bcL was placed in a 96-well plate and 100 \u00b5L samples were extracted by directly adding 300 \u00b5L of precooled methanol and acetonitrile. Internal standards mix 1 (IS1) and internal standards mix 2 (IS2) were added for quality control of sample preparation (2:1, v/v). After vortexing for 1 min and incubation at -20 \u00b0C for 2 h, samples were centrifuged for 20 min at 2000 rcf. The supernatant was then transferred for vacuum freeze drying. The metabolites were resuspended in 150 \u00b5L of 50% methanol and centrifuged for 30 min at 2000 rcf. The supernatants were then transferred to autosampler vials for LC-MS analysis. A quality control (QC) sample was prepared by pooling the same volume of each sample to evaluate the reproducibility of the LC-MS analysis.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Dunn WB, Broadhurst D, Begley P, Zelena E, Francis-McIntyre S, Anderson N, Brown M, Knowles JD, Halsall A, Haselden JN, Nicholls AW, Wilson ID, Kell DB, Goodacre R; Human Serum Metabolome (HUSERMET) Consortium.
