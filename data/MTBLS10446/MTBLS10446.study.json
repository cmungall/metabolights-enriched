                "description": "<p>In our investigation, we examined biochemical parameters and identified hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (HBDH) as a significant predictor for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients. A group of 100 patients was used to explore potential biomarkers related to progression-free survival (PFS). Subsequently, an independent cohort of 404 patients from a separate hospital was recruited to validate our findings. Our results revealed a strong association between elevated HBDH levels and poor PFS. Furthermore, while overexpression of LDHB, but not LDHA, was notably linked to poorer outcomes, HBDH expression emerged as a more robust predictor of clinical prognosis compared to LDH expression. Our investigations, which included metabolic and genetic pathway enrichment analyses, indicated that patients exhibiting heightened HBDH expression were characterized by distinct pathways related to energy metabolism and lymphoma progression. In conclusion, elevated HBDH levels were correlated with adverse survival and might serve as an independent parameter for evaluating patient outcomes.</p>",

Liver, heart and renal function were measured in the included patients at the time of disease diagnosis. We retrospectively collected clinical and laboratory information from the Han Chinese patients\u2019 electronic medical records, including age, sex, disease stage, IPI scores, and liver, kidney and heart biochemical marker data. The detailed variables are shown in Table S1 in the paper associated with this study. Patients with severe hepatic, heart, or renal insufficiency, HIV infection, primary central nervous system lymphoma or transformed indolent lymphoma were excluded. Patients with a previous malignancy or pregnancy and those who did not agree to participate in the follow-up were also excluded. Disease staging was investigated by computed tomography (CT) scans and/or positron emission tomography-CT and bone marrow biopsy. The cell-of-origin (COO) classification was determined by the Hans algorithm. Patients with more than 40% MYC-positive cells and 50% BCL2-positive cells were identified as having double expressor lymphoma (DEL). Patients included in this study were treated with rituximab-based immunochemotherapy. The treatment regimens for all patients were as follows: rituximab 375 397 mg/m^2 on Day 0, cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m^2, doxorubicin 50 mg/m^2, vincristine 1.4 mg/m^2 on Day 1 and prednisone 60 mg/m^2 orally on Days 1-5.
