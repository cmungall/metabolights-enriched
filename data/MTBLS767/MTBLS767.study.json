                "description": "<p>Tapping into the metabolic cross-talk between a host and its virus can reveal unique strategies employed during infection. Viral infection is a dynamic process that generates an evolving metabolic landscape. Gaining a continuous view into the infection process is highly challenging and is limited by current metabolomics approaches, which typically measure the average of the entire population at various stages of infection. Here, we took an innovative approach to study the metabolic basis of host-virus interactions between the bloom-forming alga Emiliania huxleyi and its specific virus. We combined a classical method in virology, the plaque assay, with advanced mass spectrometry imaging (MSI), an approach we termed \u2018in plaque-MSI\u2019. Taking advantage of the spatial characteristics of the plaque, we mapped the metabolic landscape induced during infection in a high spatiotemporal resolution, unfolding the infection process in a continuous manner. Further unsupervised spatially-aware clustering, combined with known lipid biomarkers, revealed a systematic metabolic shift during infection towards lipids containing the odd-chain fatty acid pentadecanoic acid (C15:0). Applying \u2018in plaque-MSI\u2019 might facilitate the discovery of bioactive compounds that mediate the chemical arms race of host-virus interactions in diverse model systems. </p><p><br></p><p> <strong>GC- and LC-MS assays</strong> are reported in the current study <strong>MTBLS767</strong>. </p><p> <strong>Imaging MS assays</strong> are reported in <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS769' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS769</strong></a>.</p>",

Cells were cultured in K/2 medium[1] in artificial seawater (ASW)[2] supplemented with ampicillin (100 \u00b5g/ml) and kanamycin (50 \u00b5g/ml), and incubated at 18 \u00b0C with a 16:8 h light:dark illumination cycle. A light intensity of 100 \u03bcmol photons/m^2/s was provided by cool white light-emitting diode lights. The virus used for this study is the lytic E. huxleyi virus EhV201[3].\n</p>\nLipids were extracted from liquid cultures of E. huxleyi cells infected with EhV201 and from non-infected cells harvested at 4, 24, 48 and 72 hpi in 3 biological replicates. Infection was performed on exponential phase cultures (5 x 10^5 to 10^6 cells/ml), which were infected 2-3 h after the onset of the light period, with a 1:100 volumetric ratio of viral lysate to culture (multiplicity of infection of 1:1 viral particles per cell). The samples (30-150 ml of each culture, equivalent to ~5 x 10^7 cells per sample) were collected on GF/C filters (pre-combusted at 400 \u00b0C for 8 h), plunged into liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 \u00b0C until analysis[4].\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Keller, M.

Briefly, filters containing algae were placed in 15 ml glass tube and extracted with 3 ml of a pre-cooled (-20 \u00b0C) homogenous methanol:methyl-tert-butyl-ether (MTBE) 1:3 (v/v) mixture containing 0.1 \u03bcg/ml of glucosylceramide (d18:1/12:0) which was used as an internal standard. The tubes were shaken for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C and then sonicated for 30 min. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) grade water:methanol (3:1, v/v) solution (1.5 ml) was added to the tubes followed by centrifugation. The upper organic phase (1.2 ml) was transferred into 2 ml Eppendorf tube. The polar phase containing algae debris and filter pieces was re-extracted with 0.5 ml of MTBE. Organic phases were combined and dried under N2 stream and then stored at -80 \u00b0C until analysis.\n</p>\nExtraction of lipids from plaque samples was performed by suspending the upper soft layer containing the plaque in the lipid extraction solution, following the same procedure described above (using third of the mentioned volumes). As a blank, soft layer without E. huxleyi cells (i.e. ASW + K/2 containing 0.2% agarose only) was extracted as well. Samples were extracted in 3 replicates. Isolation, concentration and lipid extraction of vesicles and virions was performed as previously described[2]. Briefly, all dried lipid extracts were re-suspended in 300 \u03bcl buffer B (ACN:IPA 7:3 + 1% 1M NH4Ac + 0.1% acetic acid) and centrifuged at 18,000 x g and 4 \u00b0C for 5 min. 200 \u03bcl of the supernatant were transferred to an autosampler vial.\n</p>\nThe fatty acid (FA) composition of lipids was analyzed using derivatized fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs). The samples were dissolved in 500 \u00b5l 1.25 M methanolic hydrochloride (MeOH/HCl, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), incubated for 1 h at 80 \u00b0C while shaking, and then dried under N2 flow. The resulting FAMEs were extracted twice with 250 \u00b5l hexane:chloroform 1:1 and once with 250 \u00b5l chloroform, each extraction for 30 min at room temperature while shaking. The extracts were dried under N2 flow. The dried FAME extracts were re-suspended in 100 \u00b5l hexane and centrifuged at 18,000 x g and 4 \u00b0C for 5 min.\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Hummel, J. et al.

Lipid extracts were analyzed using a Waters ACQUITY UPLC I-Class system coupled to a SYNAPT G2 HDMS mass spectrometer (Waters Corp., Milford, MA, USA). Chromatographic conditions were as described previously[1]. Briefly, the chromatographic separation was performed on an ACQUITY UPLC BEH C8 column (2.1 x 100 mm, i.d., 1.7 \u03bcm) (Waters Corp., Milford, MA, USA). The mobile phase consisted of water (UPLC grade) with 1% 1 M NH4Ac, 0.1% acetic acid (mobile phase A), and acetonitrile:isopropanol (7:3) with 1% 1 M NH4Ac, 0.1% acetic acid (mobile phase B). The column was maintained at 40 \u00b0C and the flow rate of the mobile phase was 0.4 ml/min.  The gradient separation was as follows: 1 min 45% A, 3 min linear gradient from 45% to 35% A, 8 min linear gradient from 35% to 11% A, 3 min linear gradient from 11% to 0% A. After washing the column for 4 min with 0% A, the buffer was set back to 45% A and the column was re-equilibrated for 4 min (22 min total run time).\n</p>\nGC-MS for FAME analysis:</br>\nPost extraction, the supernatant was transferred to an autosampler vial and an aliquot of 1 \u03bcl was subjected to GC-MS. The GC-MS system comprised an Agilent 7890A gas chromatograph equipped with split/splitless injector, and LECO Pegasus HT Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometer (TOF-MS, LECO Corp., St Joseph, MI, USA). GC was performed on a 30 m x 0.25 mm x 0.25 \u03bcm Rxi-5Sil MS column (Restek). Samples were analyzed in the splitless mode; injector temperature was set at 280 \u00b0C. Analytes by 1 \u03bcl injected were separated using the following chromatographic conditions: helium was used as carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. The thermal gradient started at 80 \u00b0C and was held at this temperature for 2 min, ramped to 330 \u00b0C at 15 \u00b0C/min and then held at 330 \u00b0C for 6.0 min.\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Hummel J, Segu S, Li Y, Irgang S, Jueppner J, Giavalisco P.

MS parameters were as follows: the source and de-solvation temperatures were maintained at 120 \u00b0C and 450 \u00b0C, respectively. The capillary voltage and cone voltage were set to 1.0 kV and 40 V, respectively. Nitrogen was used as de-solvation gas and cone gas at the flow rate of 800 l/h and 20 l/h, respectively. The mass spectrometer was operated in full scan MSE positive resolution mode over a mass range of 50-1500 Da. For the high energy scan function, a collision energy ramp of 15-35 eV was applied, for the low energy scan function -4 eV was applied. Leucine-enkephalin was used as lock-mass reference standard. The major ions and specific fragment ions of the lipids were analyzed in positive ionization mode. For MS/MS (in positive ionization mode), collision energy ramp of 10-45 eV was applied.\n</p>\nGC-MS for FAME analysis:</br>\nEluting compounds were detected using a LECO Pegasus HT Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometer (TOF-MS, LECO). Eluents were fragmented in the electron impact mode with an ionization voltage of 70 eV. The MS mass range was 45-800 m/z with an acquisition rate of 20 spectra per second. The ion source chamber was set to 250 \u00b0C and the transfer line to 250 \u00b0C.",

The putative identification of lipid species that were new to this host-virus model system (listed in Table 1 in the paper associated with this study) was based on the Lipid Maps computationally-generated database of lipid classes and structure database (LMSD)[4] (Metabolomics Standards Initiative level 2 annotation[5]). See Figs S4-S6, in the paper associated with this study, for MS/MS spectra and list of fragments of representative species of each class. 5 unidentified mass features, later termed sulfonioglycerolipids (listed in Table 1 in the paper associated with this study), did not exist in our in-house repository or in public repositories such as Lipid Maps[4] and METLIN[6]. Putative structures of these sulfonioglycerolipids, which belong to the same putatively characterized compound class (level 3 annotation), was based on accurate mass and LC-MS/MS fragmentation pattern, as elaborated in Fig S3 in the paper associated with this study. Full list of the lipids annotated using LC-MS/MS and their fragments can be found in Table S4 and Table S5 in the paper associated with this study.\n</p>\nGC-MS for FAME analysis:</br>\nFAMEs were identified by comparison of their mass spectra and retention times to the corresponding standards, injected in the same GC-MS conditions. 2 standards were used: methyl pentadecanoate (C15:0 FAME, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) and methyl 12-methylmyristate (Methyl 12-C14:0 FAME, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA, USA), at a concentration of 10 \u03bcg/ml in hexane.\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Ziv C, Malitsky S, Othman A, Ben-Dor S, Wei Y, Zheng S, Aharoni A, Hornemann T, Vardi A.
