                "description": "In saccharide analysis by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS), electron ionization (EI) is used almost exclusively, whereas other gentler methods of ionization are rarely used. Field ionization (FI) is recognized as a GC/MS ionization method that causes fewer fragment ions, but only few studies are available on its use in saccharide analysis. To evaluate the usefulness of FI in profiling isomeric saccharides by GC/MS and to explore its potential application in metabolome analysis, we compared EI, chemical ionization (CI), and FI spectral patterns of consecutive mono- and disaccharides derivatized with methoxamine-HCl and N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide. FI produced molecular ions and fragment ions characteristic of constitutive isomeric disaccharides. All of the derivatized saccharides that originally had free anomeric OH showed methyloxime-moiety fragment ions, attributable to the cleavage between C2 and C3. Some fragment ions in FI were indicative of the position of dihexose linkages. Although EI with lowered voltage (18 V, 130 \u00b0C) produced fewer fragment ions than conventional EI (70 V, 250 \u00b0C) did, fragmentation patterns were different from those of FI. Our data show that FI is useful for distinguishing isomeric saccharides in qualitative analyses.",

In FI mode, 2 \u00b5l was injected using splitless mode unless otherwise stated. The injector temperature was set at 230 \u00b0C. GC separation was performed on a HP-5MS capillary column (30 m x 0.32 mm x 0.25 \u00b5m; Agilent Technologies) with a carrier gas (He) flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. The oven temperature gradient for the derivatized standard saccharides was as follows. After a 4 min, 70 \u00b0C isotherm period, the oven was programmed to rise to 325 \u00b0C at a rate of 35 \u00b0C/min, then held at 325 \u00b0C for 1 min.

Unless otherwise stated, EI voltage and current were 70 V with 300 \u00b5A and 18 V with 100 \u00b5A, respectively. For FI measurements, carbon emitters purchased from CARBOTEC (Bonn, Germany) were used; the emitter (CARBOTEC FI) consists of a 5 \u00b5m tungsten wire with a carbon microneedle coating, max current on which is 11.5 mA. Cathode voltage for FI was set at \u2013l0 kV. The emitter was refreshed with a 10 mA flush current for 30 ms in every 400 ms spectral data acquisition cycle as described previously [1]. Each emitter could be used for 80 repeated injections, at least, without any visible sign of degradation in spectral patterns or increased background signals. The recording m/z range was 10\u20131600 in all ionization modes. Typical pressures in the ion source and mass analyzer were on the order of 10\u20134 Pa and 10\u20135 Pa, respectively, for both EI and FI modes. The micro-channel plate detector voltage was set at 1700 V for regular EI mode, 2100 V for low-voltage (18 V) EI mode, and 2100 V for FI mode. The detector gain differences (peak intensity enhancement) between each voltage setting were 12.7 times (from 1700 V to 1850 V) and 125 times (from 1700 V to 2100 V), respectively.",

The test samples were derivatized by using the above-mentioned protocol, and 1 \u00b5l (out of 100 \u00b5l) from each tube was subjected to GC/MS analysis with each ionization mode. The peak areas (N = 3 for each concentration) of conventional EI-mode extracted ion chromatogram (EIC, m/z 319.2) showed good linearity (R2 = 0.9991) in sample concentrations from 50 pmol/\u00b5l (the lowest concentration tested) to 5 nmol/\u00b5l (the highest concentration that gave no detector saturation). The peak areas of FI-mode EIC (m/z 569.3) showed good linearity (R2 = 0.9987) from 5 nmol/\u00b5l (the lowest concentration that gave good signal-to-noise ratio (S/N)) up to 100 nmol/\u00b5l (linearity lost above this concentration).",
