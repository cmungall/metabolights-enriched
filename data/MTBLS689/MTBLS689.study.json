                "description": "<div><b>INTRODUCTION:</b> Neonatal cholestatic disorders are a group of hepatobiliary diseases occurring in the first 3 months of life. The most common causes of neonatal cholestasis are infantile hepatitis syndrome (IHS) and biliary atresia (BA). The clinical manifestations of the two diseases are too similar to distinguish them. However, early detection is very important in improving the clinical outcome of BA. Currently, a liver biopsy is the only proven and effective method used to differentially diagnose these two similar diseases in the clinic. However, this method is invasive. Therefore, sensitive and non-invasive biomarkers are needed to effectively differentiate between BA and IHS. We hypothesized that urinary metabolomics can produce unique metabolite profiles for BA and IHS.</div><div><b>OBJECTIVES:</b> The aim of this study was to characterize urinary metabolomic profiles in infants with BA and IHS, and to identify differences among infants with BA, IHS, and normal controls (NC).</div><div><b>METHODS:</b> Urine samples along with patient characteristics were obtained from 25 BA, 38 IHS, and 38 NC infants. A non-targeted gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) metabolomics method was used in conjunction with orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) to explore the metabolomic profiles of BA, IHS, and NC infants.</div><div><b>RESULTS:</b> In total, 41 differentially expressed metabolites between BA vs. NC, IHS vs. NC, and BA vs. IHS were identified. N-acetyl-D-mannosamine and alpha-aminoadipic acid were found to be highly accurate at distinguishing between BA and IHS.</div><div><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b> BA and IHS infants have specific urinary metabolomic profiles. The results of our study underscore the clinical potential of metabolomic profiling to uncover metabolic changes that could be used to discriminate BA from IHS.</div>",

Briefly, a TG-5MS GC column (Thermo, 0.25 mm, 30 m) in split mode with a 20:1 ratio of the above samples was used. Helium was used as the carrier gas, and was maintained at a constant flow of 1.2 ml/min. The oven temperature was initially maintained at 60 \u00b0C for 1 min, then increased to 320 \u00b0C at 20 \u00b0C/min, and then held constant for 5 min. The transfer line temperature between the gas\nchromatograph and the mass spectrometer was set to 250 \u00b0C.\n</br></br>\nBefore and after each injection, the 10 \u03bcl injection syringe was washed three times with 10 \u03bcl ethyl acetate. Samples were injected between 2\u201324 h after derivatization using randomized sequences.\n</br></br>\nA mixture of internal retention index (RI) markers was prepared using fatty acid methyl esters of C8-C20 and C21-C40 linear chain length, dissolved in toluene at concentrations of 40 mg/l each. Aliquots (10 \u03bcl) of C8-C20 mixture and (10 \u03bcl) of C21-C40 mixture were added to 80 \u03bcl hexane, and then the mixture was shaken at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min. The mixture was then transferred to a sampler vial with a glass insert.\n</br></br>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Li WW, Shan JJ, Lin LL, Xie T, He LL, Yang Y, Wang SC.

MS-DIAL[1] software was used for raw peak exaction, data baseline filtering and calibration, peak alignment, deconvolution analysis, and peak identification. Parameter settings were used as follows. Peak detection: Smoothing method: Linear weighted moving average; Smoothing level: 2 scan; Average peak width: 20 scan; Minimun peak height: 1000 amplitude. Deconvolution parameters: Sigma window value: 0.5; EI spectra cut off: 10 amplitude. Identification settings: Use retention index; MSP file: FiehnLib database[2]; RI tolerance: 3000; RT tolerance: 0.5; m/z tolerance: 0.5; EI similarity cut off: 70%; Identification score cut off: 70%. Spectra were matched against the FiehnLib mass spectral and retention index library. In addition, metabolites were also identified by mass spectra matching against the reference spectra in the NIST 2014 standard database built-in Xcalibur 2.2 software. Briefly, metabolites were identified by comparing the mass fragments with NIST 2014 standard database with a similarity of >70% and finally verified by available reference standards.\n</br></br>\nThe data normalization step was completed using MetaboAnalyst 3.0 (http://www.metaboanalyst.ca). 3 types of data normalization protocols were then used to reduce\nsystematic variance and to improve the performance for downstream statistical analysis (see Fig. S1 in the paper associated with this study). The first one was 'normalization by sum', which normalizes each sample to a constant sum so that it is comparable to the others. 'Log transformations' was the second method, used to correct for heteroscedasticity and pseudo scaling, and to make multiplicative models additive. The former 2 methods were used for univariate analysis. The third method, 'pareto scaling', was applied to reduce the relative importance of large values while keeping the data structure partially intact[3][4]. Student\u2019s t test, heatmap analysis, and ROC curve analysis were also performed using MetaboAnalyst 3.0. SIMCA-P 13.0 (Umetrics, Umea, Sweden) was used to perform multivariate statistical analysis of OPLS-DA and to obtain the variable important in projection (VIP) score of each metabolite. Significant metabolites were selected from the volcano plot with fold change (FC) > 1.5 or < 0.67, with a Student\u2019s t test p value threshold < 0.05, a false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05, and VIP > 1 in the above OPLS-DA model.\n</br></br>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Tsugawa H, Cajka T, Kind T, Ma Y, Higgins B, Ikeda K, Kanazawa M, VanderGheynst J, Fiehn O, Arita M.
