                "description": "Since the discovery that cytosine deoxynucleotides could be methylated (dC5m), not much is known in higher eukaryotes about modifications affecting other deoxynucleotides. Here, we now report that we detected N-6-methyl-deoxyadenosine (dA6m) not only in frog DNA, but also in other species including mouse and human. Our methylome analysis revealed that dA6m is widely distributed across the eukaryotic genome, is present in different cell types, but commonly depleted from gene exons. Since dA6m is a direct modification of DNA, it has the potential to generate a significant impact on different biological areas. Ultimately, our work shows that deoxycytidine modifications might not be the only ones in higher eukaryotes, suggesting that such direct DNA modifications might be more widespread than previously thought.",

                        "description": "Genomic DNA isolation:</br>\nGenomic DNA was isolated from different tissues and species. After homogenization of the samples (Precellys 24) and addition of phenol chloroform, and the aqueous phase was precipitated with isopropanol and sodium acetate. After 2 washes with 70% EtOH, the DNA was digested with RNAse A for at least 16 hrs at 37 \u00b0C. The DNA was subsequently treated with Proteinase K and purified using the DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen). To ensure removal of any RNAse, the DNA was again digested with RNAse A and Proteinase K, and repeatedly extracted with the DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit. The concentration of the genomic DNA was measured using the Qubit double stranded High Sensitivity assay kit.\n</p>\nDNA immunoprecipitation (DIP):</br>\nDNA immunoprecipitaiton was prepared using the protocol from [1], with the following variations: After the isolation of genomic DNA, at least 20 \u00b5g DNA was fractionated into 100-200bp fragments using the bioruptor (Diagenode). About 1 \u00b5g or the fractionated DNA was put aside as an input control. The rest of the fragmented genomic DNA was resuspended in a 1 ml final reaction volume containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Igepal CA-630 and 1.5 \u00b5g/\u00b5l BSA. To this, at least 2.5 \u00b5g of the dA6m Ab (Synaptic Systems GmbH, m6A antibody, Cat. No. 202003) was added. Alternatively, the following antibodies were used: dA6m Ab* (Synaptic Systems GmbH, m6A antibody, Cat. No. 202011), dA6m Ab** (Synaptic Systems GmbH, m6A antibody, Cat. No. 202111), IgG (Abcam, Cat. No. ab171870). After an overnight incubation at 4 \u00b0C on a rotor, 100 \u00b5l of prewashed protein A magnetic beads were added for 2 hrs at 4 \u00b0C. Next, the supernatant was removed while Ab bound to the beads was retained using a magnet. After 5 washes with the washing buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Igepal CA-630), the DNA bound Ab fraction was eluted. For almost all applications, the DNA was eluted from the Ab and beads with 150 \u00b5l of elution buffer that contained 10 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Igepal CA-630, 6.7 mM methylated adenosine triphophate). The mixture was then incubated for 1 hr with continuous shaking at 37 \u00b0C. The supernatant was removed, and then another 150 \u00b5l of elution buffer was added to remove any unbound remaining fraction. Next, the supernatants were combined, precipitated, and used for subsequent analysis.\n</p>\nDNA oligos:</br>\nSynthetic oligos were used on dot-blots and pulldown studies. The sequence of the 25bp DNA oligo with no dA6m is 5\u2019 AGTCGTTCATCTAGTTGCGGTGTAC 3\u2019. The sequence of the 25bp DNA oligo with dA6m is 5\u2019 AGTCGTTCATCT(dA6m) GTTGCGGTGTAC 3\u2019.

These strains were obtained from NEB (dam-/dcm- Competent E.coli). They have the following genotype:  ara-14 leuB6 fhuA31 lacY1 tsx78 glnV44 galK2 galT22 mcrA dcm-6 hisG4 rfbD1 R(zgb210::Tn10) TetS endA1 rspL136 (StrR) dam13::Tn9 (CamR) xylA-5 mtl-1 thi-1 mcrB1 hsdR2.

These strains were obtained from Invitrogen. X. laevis fat and oviduct samples were obtained from female adults. X. laevis testes were isolated from adult males.

Next, 30 \u00b5l of 0.5 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.9) was added, and the phosphatase reaction was continued for another hour at 37 \u00b0C. Next, 400 \u00b5l of water was added, together with silicic acid that filled the 1.7 ml Eppendorf tube to about 200 \u00b5l. After incubation for 15 min with occasional vortexing, the sample mixture was transferred onto 0.45 \u00b5m cellulose acetate filters.  After centrifugation the silicic acid granules were removed.
