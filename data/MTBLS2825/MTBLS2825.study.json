                "description": "<p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> Converting carbon dioxide (CO2) into value-added chemicals using engineered cyanobacteria is a promising strategy to tackle the global warming and energy shortage issues. However, most cyanobacteria are autotrophic and use CO2 as a sole carbon source, which makes it hard to compete with heterotrophic hosts in either growth or productivity. One strategy to overcome this bottleneck is to introduce sugar utilization pathways to enable photomixotrophic growth with CO2 and sugar (e.g., glucose and xylose). Advances in engineering mixotrophic cyanobacteria have been obtained, while a systematic interrogation of these engineered strains is missing. This work aimed to fill the gap at omics level.</p><p><strong>RESULTS:</strong> We first constructed two engineered <em>Synechococcus elongatus</em> YQ2-gal and YQ3-xyl capable of utilizing glucose and xylose, respectively. To investigate the metabolic mechanism, transcriptomic and metabolomic analysis were then performed in the engineered photomixotrophic strains YQ2-gal and YQ3-xyl. Transcriptome and metabolome of wild-type <em>S. elongatus</em> were set as baselines. Increased abundance of metabolites in glycolysis or pentose phosphate pathway indicated that efficient sugar utilization significantly enhanced carbon flux in <em>S. elongatus</em> as expected. However, carbon flux was redirected in strain YQ2-gal as more flowed into fatty acids biosynthesis but less into amino acids. In strain YQ3-xyl, more carbon flux was directed into synthesis of sucrose, glucosamine and acetaldehyde, while less into fatty acids and amino acids. Moreover, photosynthesis and bicarbonate transport could be affected by upregulated genes, while nitrogen transport and assimilation were regulated by less transcript abundance of related genes in strain YQ3-xyl with utilization of xylose.</p><p><strong>CONCLUSIONS:</strong> Our work identified metabolic mechanism in engineered <em>S. elongatus</em> during photomixotrophic growth, where regulations of fatty acids metabolism, photosynthesis, bicarbonate transport, nitrogen assimilation and transport are dependent on different sugar utilization. Since photomixotrophic cyanobacteria is regarded as a promising cell factory for bioproduction, this comprehensive understanding of metabolic mechanism of engineered <em>S. elongatus</em> during photomixotrophic growth would shed light on the engineering of more efficient and controllable bioproduction systems based on this potential chassis.</p>",

Enzymes and kits used for molecular cloning were purchased from New England Biolabs (NEB, USA). Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI, China). Spectinomycin and IPTG (Isopropyl-\u03b2-d-thiogalactopyranoside) used in this study were obtained from MDBio (MDBio, Inc., China) and Biotopped (Biotopped Life Science, China), respectively.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Strain, medium and growth conditions</strong></p><p>All cyanobacterial strains used in this study were summarized in <strong>Table 1</strong>, in the paper associated with this study, and cultured in BG-11 media at 30&nbsp;\u00b0C with continuous illumination of 2000-3000&nbsp;lx<strong>[1]</strong>. Spectinomycin (20&nbsp;\u03bcg/mL) and IPTG (0.1&nbsp;mM) were added to select recombinant strains and induce the Ptrc promoter. Glucose 5&nbsp;g/L (27.78&nbsp;mM) or xylose of 5&nbsp;g/L (33.33&nbsp;mM) was supplemented as organic carbon source. All <em>Escherichia coli </em>(<em>E.coli</em>) strains were cultivated in LB medium (5&nbsp;g/L of yeast extract, 10&nbsp;g/L of tryptone, 10&nbsp;g/L of NaCl, pH 7.0) at 37&nbsp;\u00b0C. <em>E. coli</em> MG1655 genomic DNA was used as a PCR template for target gene amplification. <em>E. coli</em> DH5\u03b1 was used for plasmid construction and propagation. Spectinomycin (20&nbsp;\u03bcg/mL) was added for selecting transformants harboring a plasmid.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>DNA manipulation, plasmid and strain construction</strong></p><p>All primers and plasmids used in this study were listed in <strong>Table S1</strong> and <strong>S2</strong> in the paper associated with this study. Genes <em>galP</em>, <em>xylE</em>, <em>xylA </em>and <em>xylB</em> were amplified from <em>E. coli</em> MG1655 genomic DNA. <em>galP</em> gene was amplified using primers G1 and G2, digested with MfeI and BgIII, and then ligated with pAM2991 digested with EcoRI and BamHI to create pAM2991-galP. <em>xylE</em> gene was amplified by primers X1 and X2. <em>xylAB</em> genes was amplified by primers X3 and X4. And 2 fragments of pAM2991 template were amplified by primers V1 and V2, V3 and V4, respectively. Gibson Assembly was applied to fuse these four gene fragments to create pAM2991-xylEAB. Plasmids carrying target genes or empty backbone were then transformed into <em>S. elongatus</em> following the method described previously<strong>[2]</strong>. Briefly, <em>S. elongatus</em> at exponential phase was collected and transformation was conducted at 30&nbsp;\u00b0C with gentle agitation overnight in the dark. Transformants were selected by spectinomycin and correct recombinants were confirmed by colony PCR to verify integration into cyanobacterial chromosome at NSI.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Metabolomics profiling</strong></p><p><strong>Glucose-consuming strain</strong> (YQ2-gal) was cultivated with <strong>glucose</strong> for 8&nbsp;days before collection and <strong>xylose-consuming strain</strong> (YQ3-xyl) was cultivated with <strong>xylose</strong> for 10&nbsp;days before collection. <strong>Wild-type strain</strong> was collected under the same cultivation condition but <strong>without sugar</strong>. The collected cells were washed twice with distilled water and pellet was for the following extraction process. Strains with 6 biological replicates were collected at exponential phase for metabolomics profiling. All supernatants as well as QC sample were subjected to metabolomics profiling by 2777C UPLC system (Water, UK) coupled with mass spectrometer Xevo G2-XS QTOF (Waters, UK) by Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI, China).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Cao YQ, Li Q, Xia PF, Wei LJ, Guo N, Li JW, Wang SG.

Features detected in less than 50% of the QC samples or less than 20% of the experimental samples were removed, and missing values were imputed using the k-nearest neighbor (KNN) method. The QC-robust spline batch correction (QC-RSC) was used to correct signal drift and batch variation. The relative sd (RSD) value of metabolites in the QC samples was set at a threshold of 30%, and features with a RSD less than 30% in the QC samples were retained<strong>[1]</strong>. After normalization and filtering, univariate and multivariate were conducted by <strong>metaX</strong>. Metabolites driving differences were identified by reaching variable importance for the projection (VIP) \u2265\u20091, FC \u2265\u20091.2 or \u2264\u20090.833 and p value &lt;\u20090.05.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Liu R, Hong J, Xu X, Feng Q, Zhang D, Gu Y, Shi J, Zhao S, Liu W, Wang X, Xia H, Liu Z, Cui B, Liang P, Xi L, Jin J, Ying X, Wang X, Zhao X, Li W, Jia H, Lan Z, Li F, Wang R, Sun Y, Yang M, Shen Y, Jie Z, Li J, Chen X, Zhong H, Xie H, Zhang Y, Gu W, Deng X, Shen B, Xu X, Yang H, Xu G, Bi Y, Lai S, Wang J, Qi L, Madsen L, Wang J, Ning G, Kristiansen K, Wang W.
