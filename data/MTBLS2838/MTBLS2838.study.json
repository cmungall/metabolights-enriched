                "description": "<p>Global-scale surveys of plankton communities using \u201comics\u201d techniques have revolutionized our understanding of the ocean. Lipidomics has demonstrated the potential to add further essential insights on ocean ecosystem function but has yet to be applied on a global scale. We analyzed 930 lipid samples across the global ocean using a uniform high-resolution accurate-mass mass spectrometry analytical workflow, revealing previously unknown characteristics of ocean planktonic lipidomes. Focusing on 10 molecularly diverse glycerolipid classes, we identified 1151 distinct lipid species, finding that fatty acid unsaturation (i.e., number of carbon-carbon double bonds) is fundamentally constrained by temperature. We predict substantial declines in the essential fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid over the next century, which are likely to have serious deleterious effects on economically critical fisheries.</p>",

By date these cruises are KN207-1 on the R/V Knorr (April-May 2012), AE1319 on the R/V Atlantic Explorer (July-August 2013), KN210-04 on the R/V Knorr (March-April 2013), AE1409 on the R/V Atlantic Explorer (May 2014), KM1709 on the Kilo Moana (June-July 2017), RR1813 on the R/V Roger Revelle (August-September 2018), and LMG1810 on the R/V L.M. Gould (November 2018). <strong>Sea water </strong>was collected from the CTD rosette Niskin bottles and transferred into polycarbonate bottles before filtering. We collected particulate biomass by filtering <strong>1 L</strong> or<strong> 2 L</strong> of <strong>sea water </strong>at ~10 bar onto 47mm x 0.22 \u00b5m hydrophilic Duropore filters (GVWP04700 MilliporeSigma) immediately after water collection. <strong>Filters </strong>were folded, wrapped in aluminum foil, then flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept frozen until extraction. We used processed <strong>CTD </strong>data to both measure the in-situ <strong>temperature </strong>at time of collection and assess <strong>mixed layer depth </strong>with <strong>density</strong>. For each cast, the <strong>mixed layer depth</strong> was calculated as the first depth where the change in density from 5 meters exceeded 0.1 kg/m^3. This definition is within the range of widely used mixed layer depth definitions<strong>[1]</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1] </strong>de Boyer Mont\u00e9gut, C.

First, frozen filters were combined with 0.8 mL of phosphate buffered saline (PBS, 137 mmol/L sodium chloride, 2.7 mmol/L potassium chloride, 11.9 mmol/L phosphate, pH = 7.4; Fisher Scientific), 2 mL of methanol, and 1 mL of dichloromethane (DCM) in 13 mL glass centrifuge tubes. An internal standard 2,4-dinitrophenyl- phosphatidylethanolamine (DNP-PE, Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc.) in methanol was added to track recovery and retention time movement (20 \u03bcL, concentration 65.6 \u03bcmol/L). Along with this we add 10 \u03bcL of 1.5 mmol butylated-hydroxy-toluene to each sample to resist sample oxidation. Following this step, samples are placed in a Fisher Scientific FS110 sonic bath for 10 min. A final 1 mL of DCM and 1 mL of PBS is added to each sample causing phase separation. To aid this process, samples are centrifuged at 515 x g for 5 min in an Eppendorf 5702 centrifuge. After this separation step we transferred the organic phase at the bottom of the centrifuge tube to 2 mL HPLC vials. We stored these total lipid extracts under argon and frozen (-20 \u00b0C) to limit the possibility of oxidation before analysis. For each sample we took 100 \u03bcL of this total lipid extract, evaporated the DCM with nitrogen gas, and resuspended the sample in 100 \u03bcL 70:30 v/v acetonitrile:isopropanol. Samples were again stored under argon before HPLC-HR/AM-ESI-MS analysis.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1] </strong>Popendorf KJ, Fredricks HF, Van Mooy BA.

The HPLC settings are identical to those described in a previous paper<strong>[1]</strong>. The HPLC system consisted of an autosampler, binary pump, column compartment, and diode array detector. Eluent from the HPLC was directed into a Thermo Q-Exactive Orbitrap high resolution mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher Scientific) for high resolution / accurate mass electrospray ionization mass spectral analysis (HR/AM-ESI-MS). Batches of samples were briefly stored at 4 \u00b0C in the autosampler before analysis. The liquid chromatography eluents are a follows: Eluent A was MilliQ water with 1% of 1M (aq) ammonium acetate and 0.1% of acetic acid. Eluent B was 70% acetonitrile, 30% isopropanol with 1% of 1M (aq) ammonium acetate and 0.1% acetic acid. For each sample, 20 \u03bcL was injected at the start of the 30 min program. The system was kept at a flow rate of 0.4 mL per min first with a gradient of 45% to 35% eluent A between minutes 0-4, 25 to 11% eluent A between min 4-12, then holding 1% eluent A from 15-25 min . Lastly, eluent A is returned to 45% for min 25-30 to equilibrate the column. The ESI source was set to 4.5 kV positive / 3.0 kV negative with a capillary temperature of 150 \u00b0C and ESI probe temperature of 350 \u00b0C.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Collins JR, Edwards BR, Fredricks HF, Van Mooy BA.

                        "description": "<p><strong>Lipid quantification</strong></p><p>Lipid peak areas were quantified to picograms on-column using representative linear standard curves run with identical LC-MS conditions on the same system. <strong>Table S3 </strong>in the paper associated with this study details the standards used to quantify each class. Quantification of feature peaks areas is necessary to correct for large differences in ionization response between lipid classes. While a relatively small change in ionization response has been observed between saturated and fully saturated membrane lipids of the same class, triglycerides have been shown to have a variable response based on their saturation and size<strong>[1,2]</strong>. Due to this, TAG species were corrected with individual responses based on their equivalent carbon number (ECN, <strong>Figure S1 </strong>in the paper associated with this study). ECN is defined as the number of carbons in the fatty acid chains minus 2 times the number of unsaturations (ECN = C - 2 x U). 2 4th-order polynomial functions were fit to this plot in order to predict the response factor of any TAG from its ECN. Fit 1 uses TAG standards with ECN of 24-42 and Fit 2 uses TAG standards with ECN of 42-57. TAGs with ECN &lt; 42 were corrected with Fit 1 those &gt; 42 with Fit 2. Final totals in each sample were subtracted with field blanks from each cruise with the following exceptions where field blanks were not available: samples from KN207-1 were blank corrected with field blanks KN210-4 and samples from KM1709 used solvent extraction blanks processed with these samples in the lab. In subsequent analysis, the relative abundance of each lipid compound was used; that is the quantified picograms of a lipid species divided by the total mass of relevant lipids.</p><p><br></p><p>We used the<strong> R</strong> package and pipeline <strong>LOBSTAHS </strong>to assist in the detection of lipids from a total ion chromatogram<strong>[3]</strong>. Using multiple criteria, this pipeline allows for high-throughput screening of the entire sample dataset for thousands of unique lipid species. Samples were run through this lipid detection pipeline in four batches (Group 1: KN207-1, AE1319, KN210-04, AE1409, Group 2: KM1709, Group 3: RR1813, Group 4: LMG1810) with identical parameters based on when they were analyzed via HPLC-ESI-MS. Validated annotations from each of the 4 batches were joined after analysis. First, mass features were detected, grouped, and retention time aligned across samples using the popular <strong>R </strong>package <strong>XCMS</strong>. Relevant parameters and settings used for peak detection can be found in <strong>Table S4</strong> in the paper associated with this study, for grouping found in <strong>Table S5</strong>, and for retention time alignment in <strong>Table S6</strong>. The \u2018<strong><em>centWave</em></strong>\u2019 algorithm was used for peak detection across samples. Mass features were grouped with the \u2018<strong><em>density</em></strong>\u2019 method and peaks found in less than 2% of samples were not considered for analysis. Mass features were aligned using the \u2018<strong><em>loess</em></strong>\u2019 method using features found in greater than 90% of samples. Finally, the area of missing peaks was integrated. In each feature when a peak was not initially detected in a sample, the region was integrated from the <strong>raw </strong>data.&nbsp;From here the package <strong>CAMERA </strong>was used to group features into compound \u201cpseudospectra\u201d. Pseudospectra are a group of all mass features, adducts and isotopes, likely originating from the same compound <strong>[4,5].</strong> This allows for isotope peaks and adducts deriving from the same compound to be annotated as such. Settings for <strong>CAMERA </strong>analysis can also be found in <strong>Table S7</strong> in the paper associated with this study. Finally, we used <strong>LOBSTAHS </strong>to screen pseudospectra against a database of lipid species using adduct hierarchy and accurate mass. A 2.5 ppm mass difference from the assignment was used as a hard threshold to retain any assignment in raw output. Only unoxidized annotations for the ten glycolipid classes found in <strong>Table S3</strong> were considered for further analysis. Final annotations were manually confirmed and subset from raw <strong>LOBSTAHS </strong>output using accurate mass, MS/MS (MS2) spectra, adduct hierarchy, positive-negative ionization, and retention time patterning. For 301 of these annotations representing 67% of the total quantified mass, a MS2 scan with diagnostic fragments confirming the annotation was seen giving the annotation high-confidence. See <strong>Figure S5</strong> for lipid class specific diagnostic spectra. Additionally, 300 annotations representing 52% of the mass were designated \u201cC2a'' by <strong>LOBSTAHS </strong>adduct hierarchy screening in at least one of the 4 batches. This highest designation means that the pseudospectrum for the compound contained all possible adducts in the database and contained them in the theoretical order of abundance. We compared the ionization of the major adduct in positive and negative mode for each annotation to verify similar peak shapes. Since triglycerides did not ionize in negative mode this metric was not used to assist identification. However, for 432 membrane lipid annotations representing 95% of the membrane lipid mass, the theoretically highest abundant adduct of the compound was matched between the 2 modes in a representative sample. All 1050 annotated features have an accurate mass less than or equal to 2.5 ppm of their theoretical m/z and fit within the expected fatty acid unsaturations per carbon retention time series of higher confidence annotations. Annotated features were identified as a LCEFA (EPA and/or DHA) containing feature based on diagnostic MS2 spectra. Since some mass features presented a mix of fatty acid fragments, any mass feature with a positive or negative MS2 scan that contained a LCEFA fragment in at least one representative sample was designated an EPA or DHA containing feature. A diagnostic MS2 was not available for every lipid species. On average, 6.2 \u00b1 3.4 % of possible EPA containing species and 5.3 \u00b1 3.0 % of possible DHA species by mass had no diagnostic MS2 scan (<strong>Figure S4</strong> in the paper associated with this study).</p><p><br></p><p><strong style='color: rgb(54, 54, 54);'>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong style='color: rgb(54, 54, 54);'>[1] </strong>Popendorf KJ, Fredricks HF, Van Mooy BA.

MS2 data was collected in each polarity in data-dependent mode where the top 3 most abundant ions in the previous full scan were designated for MS2, these ions were then automatically added to a dynamic exclusion list meaning it would not be chosen for MS2 for a short period. The dynamic exclusion list prevents abundant ions from dominating the MS2 data and so gives a broader depth of MS2 spectra. A 4 Da isolation window was used for features targeted with MS2, and the normalized collision energy was stepped at 30, 50 and 80 to increase the range of MS2 fragments observed.</p>",
