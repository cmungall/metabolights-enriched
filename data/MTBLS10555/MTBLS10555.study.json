                "description": "Cardiac hypertrophy is a classical forerunner of heart failure and myocardial structural and metabolic remodeling are closely associated with cardiac hypertrophy. We aim to investigate the characteristics of myocardial structure and central carbon metabolism of cardiac hypertrophy at different stages. Using echocardiography and pathological staining, early and compensatory cardiac hypertrophy were respectively defined as within 7 days and from 7 to 14 days after transverse aortic constriction (TAC) in mice. Among mass-spectrometry-based metabolomics, we identified 45 central carbon metabolites. Differential metabolite analysis showed that six metabolites, including citrate, cis-aconitate and so on, decreased significantly on day 1 after TAC. Ten metabolites, including L-lactate, (S)-2-hydroxyglutarate and so on, were obviously changed on days 10 and 14. Pathway analysis showed that these metabolites were involved in seven metabolic pathways, including carbohydrates, amino acids and so on. Western blot showed the expression of ATP-citrate lyase, malate dehydrogenase 1 and lactate dehydrogenase A in myocardium changed markedly on day 3, while the phosphorylation level of AMP-activated protein kinase did not show significantly difference. Our study reveals the characteristics of myocardial structure and central carbon metabolism of cardiac hypertrophy at different stages, which may have a suggestive role in the early diagnosis of cardiac hypertrophy.",

The MRM parameters&nbsp;for each of the targeted analytes were optimized using flow injection analysis, by injecting the standard solutions of the individual analytes, into the API source of the mass spectrometer. Several most sensitive transitions were used in the MRM scan mode to optimize the collision energy for each Q1/Q3 pair. Among the optimized MRM transitions per analyte, the Q1/Q3 pairs that showed the highest sensitivity and selectivity were selected as \u2018quantifier\u2019 for quantitative monitoring.
