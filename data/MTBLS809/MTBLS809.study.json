                "description": "The metabolic responses of cows undergo substantial changes during the transition from late pregnancy to early lactation. However, the molecular mechanisms associated with these changes in physiological metabolism have not been clearly elucidated. The objective of this study was to investigate metabolic changes in transition cows from the perspective of plasma metabolites. Plasma samples collected from 24 multiparous dairy cows on approximately d 21 prepartum and immediately postpartum were analyzed using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography/time-of-flight mass spectrometry in positive and negative ion modes. In conjunction with multidimensional statistical methods (principal component analysis and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis), differences in plasma metabolites were identified using the t-test and fold change analysis. Sixty-seven differential metabolites were identified consisting of AA, lipids, saccharides, and nucleotides. The levels of 32 plasma metabolites were significantly higher and those of 35 metabolites significantly lower after parturition than on d 21 prepartum. Pathway analysis indicated that the metabolites that increased from late pregnancy to early lactation were primarily involved in lipid metabolism and energy metabolism, whereas decreased metabolites were related to AA metabolism.",

For the experimental animals, we selected 24 healthy multiparous Holstein dairy cows with similar 305-day milk yields, parity, body condition scores (BCS), and due date from Puzhou Dairy Farm (Sichuan, China). The cows were housed in freestall barns and had free access to fresh water. A total mixed ration (TMR) diet was provided daily at 0600, 1200, and 1900 h. The ingredients and chemical composition of the prepartum TMR are shown in Supplemental Table S1 in the paper associated with this study. Blood was collected via the caudal vein at \u221221 d (21 days before the due date) before the morning feeding and on the day of calving within 6 h after the milking colostrum. Plasma was collected using ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) as an anticoagulant, then centrifuged at 1,500 x g for 10 min at room temperature, and subsequently stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. Samples were divided into 2 groups according to sampling time: 21 days before the due date (P-21 d) and after calving (P-0 d).",

For the data extracted using XCMS, ion peak data for which >50% of the data were missing within a group were deleted. After the data had been pre-processed by pareto-scaling, pattern recognition was performed using SIMCA-P software (version 14.1, Umetrics, Umea, Sweden), consisting of unsupervised principal component analysis (PCA) and supervised orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA). Principal component analysis was used to determine intra-group aggregation and inter-group separation tendencies, whereas OPLSDA was performed to further determine inter-group differences. The OPLS-DA models were validated based on interpretation of variation in Y (R2Y) and forecast ability based on the model (Q2) in cross-validation and permutation tests by applying 200 iterations. When 1 \u2265 R2Y and Q2 \u2265 0.4, the models were determined to be stable and reliable[3]. In addition, a Q2 intercept <0.05 from the permutation test was used to verify that there was no overfitting[4], and univariate analysis was performed, including Student\u2019s t-test and fold change analysis.\n</br></br>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Chambers MC, Maclean B, Burke R, Amodei D, Ruderman DL, Neumann S, Gatto L.

Identification of differential metabolites was carried out by searching an in-house standard MS/MS library and the online database METLIN (http://metlin.scripps.edu/) using MS/MS spectra or exact mass data[1]. The in-house library contains MS/MS spectra of approximately 800 compounds, which were obtained from standards. The MS/MS spectra matching score was calculated using the dot-product algorithm and the score cutoff was set as 0.8[1][2]. The MS/MS spectra that could not be matched to any of those in the in-house library were searched in online databases. Mass error was set within 25 ppm. Moreover, clustering and pathway analyses data were processed and analyzed using MetaboAnalyst 4.0 (http://www.metaboanalyst.ca).\n</br></br>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Jia H, Shen X, Guan Y, Xu M, Tu J, Mo M, Xie L, Yuan J, Zhang Z, Cai S, Zhu J, Zhu Z.
