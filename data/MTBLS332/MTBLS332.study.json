                "description": "The biological function of the plant-microbiome system is the result of contributions from the host plant and microbiome members. The Populus root microbiome is a diverse community that has high abundance of \u03b2- and \u03b3-Proteobacteria, both classes which include multiple plant-growth promoting representatives. To understand the contribution of individual microbiome members in a community, we studied the function of a simplified community consisting of Pseudomonas and Burkholderia bacterial strains isolated from Populus hosts and inoculated on axenic Populus cutting in controlled laboratory conditions. Both strains increased lateral root formation and root hair production in Arabidopsis plate assays and are predicted to encode for different functions related to growth and plant growth promotion in Populus hosts. Inoculation individually, with either bacterial isolate, increased root growth relative to uninoculated controls, and while root area was increased in mixed inoculation, the interaction term was insignificant indicating additive effects of root phenotype. Complementary data including photosynthetic efficiency, whole-transcriptome gene expression and GC-MS metabolite expression data in individual and mixed inoculated treatments indicate that the effects of these bacterial strains are unique and additive. These results suggest that the function of a microbiome community may be predicted from the additive functions of the individual members.",

BT03 bacterial strains were isolated using 3 rounds of colony-restreaking on rich medium (R2A, Franklin Lakes, BD Difco, NJ, USA) agar plates from surface-sterilized Populus deltoides roots from plants growing near the Caney Fork river in central Tennessee, USA[1]. Strains were maintained using R2A liquid or agar medium. To prepare for inoculation, strains were grown overnight in R2A medium at 25 \u00b0C and 200 rpm shaking. Bacterial suspensions were washed 2X with 10 mM MgSO4 then diluted to OD600 = 0.01 for inoculation; 10 ml of inoculum was added to plant soil immediately prior to planting.\n</p>\nPopulus deltoides (genotype \u201cWV94,\u201d ArborGen Inc. Ridgeville, SC, USA) shoot tips were sterilized by washing 5 min in 1% Tween 20, 1 min in 70% EtOH, 12 min in 0.6% NaOCl, then rinsed for 5 min 3X in sterile DI water. Cuttings were transferred to tissue culture medium containing 1X strength MS salts (Caisson Laboratories, Logan, UT, USA), 0.5% activated charcoal (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), 2% sucrose, 0.05% MES (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), 0.15% Gelrite (Plant Media, Dublin, OH, USA) and 0.1% PPM (Plant Cell Technology, Washington, DC, USA) and used as stock plants for up to 3 rounds of sub-culture. Sub-cultured plants were grown in the same tissue culture medium described above for 3 weeks until rooted, then transplanted into experimental condition media.\n</p>\nPlant inoculation and harvest:\nTissue culture rooted cuttings were planted in sterilized 3 x 3 x 4\u201d polycarbonate vessels with couplers to double headspace and containing 120 cm^3 inert clay (Pro's Choice Rapid Dry, Alpharetta, GA) and 80 ml 1X Modified Hoagland's nutrient solution (Phytotechnology Laboratories, Overland Park, KS, USA) that were subsequently inoculated with 10 ml of bacterial inoculation suspension. Plants were grown for 21 days in growth chambers under 16 h light, 8 h dark per day with ~50% humidity. Plants were harvested by carefully removing the entire plant from the soil, rinsing the root system in sterile DI water to remove loose soil, imaged and tissue was processed. Apical stem and leaves were flash-frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 \u00b0C. Root material was flash-frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 \u00b0C. Experiments were repeated twice with 5 plants per treatment per experiment. Phenotype data was analyzed using a two-way ANOVA with microbial inoculation as factors.\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Gottel N.

Sorbitol was added (to achieve 10 ng/\u00b5l final concentration) before extraction as an internal standard to correct for differences in extraction efficiency, subsequent differences in derivatization efficiency and changes in sample volume during heating. Extracts were pooled and 1 ml of the extract was dried using a nitrogen stream. Dried extracts were dissolved in acetonitrile followed by the addition of N-methyl-N-trimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide (MSTFA) with 1% trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS) and samples were then heated for 1 h at 70 \u00b0C to generate trimethylsilyl (TMS) derivatives[1][2].\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Li Y., Tschaplinski T.

The extracted peaks of known metabolites are scaled to the total ion current using predetermined scaling factors. Peaks were quantified by area integration and the concentrations normalized to the quantity of the internal standard recovered, amount of sample extracted, derivatized and injected. A large user-created database (~2300 spectra) of mass spectral electron impact ionization (EI) fragmentation patterns of TMS-derivatized compounds, as well as the Wiley Registry 10th Edition combined with NIST 2014 mass spectral library, were used to identify the metabolites of interest to be quantified. There were 3 replicate plants per treatment and treatment differences were tested for statistical significance (p = 0.05) using Student's t-tests. Data are presented as log2(fold change), which is calculated by determining fold change defined as absolute value of change up or down, then scaled by taking the logarithm of the data and applying positive or negative to indicate increase or decrease in expression, respectively.",
