                "description": "Sphingolipids are important lipids and integral members of membranes, where they form small microdomains called lipid rafts. These rafts are enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids, which influences biophysical properties. Interestingly, the membranes of the biomedical model organism Caenorhabditis elegans contain only low amounts of cholesterol. Sphingolipids in C. elegans are based on an unusual C17iso branched sphingoid base. In order to analyze and the sphingolipidome of C. elegans in more detail, we performed fractionation of lipid extracts and depletion of glycero- and glycerophospholipids together with in-depth analysis using UPLC-UHR-ToF-MS. In total we were able to detect 82 different sphingolipids from different classes, including several isomeric species.",

                        "description": "<p><strong>Lipid extraction</strong></p><p>Lipids were extracted according to the Folch method<strong>[1]</strong>. A pellet of about 750 mg (wet weight) of mixed stage worm samples was mixed with 1 mL of MeOH and homogenized in a Precellys Evolution bead beater (Bertin Instruments, Montigny-le-Bretonneux, France) at about 0 \u00b0C and 8000 rpm for 3x 10 s with 20 s pause between. After addition of 2 mL CHCl3 the sample was shaken for 1 h at room temperature and 500 rpm using an Eppendorf ThermoMixer C (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). Phase separation was induced by addition of 1 mL H2O and centrifugation at an RCF of 15,294 x g and 4 \u00b0C for 15 min. The polar phase was re-extracted with 2 mL of CHCl3 / MeOH / H2O (v/v, 86 / 14 / 1) for 15 min. After phase separation organic phases were combined and dried in 2 aliquots in a SpeedVac Savant centrifugal evaporator (Thermo Scientific, Dreieich, Germany). One aliquot was re-dissolved in 50 \u00b5L iPrOH / ACN / H2O (v/v, 60 / 35 / 5) prior to analysis with UPLC-UHR-ToF-MS and the other in CHCl3 for lipid fractionation.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Sphingolipid fractionation</strong></p><p>Sphingolipids were fractionated according to literature<strong>[2]</strong>. Briefly, different sphingolipids were eluted from either separated or piggy-backed LC-NH2 (Supelclean LC-NH2 SPE tubes, 1 mL, 100 mg sorbent, Supelco) and LC-WCX (Supelclean LC-WCX SPE tubes, 1 mL, 100 mg sorbent) SPE columns. In total 8 different solvent mixtures were used to obtain 7 fractions. Fractionation was exactly performed as described<strong>[2]</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Glycero- and Glycerophospholipid depletion&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Depletion of glycerol- and glycerophospholipids was adapted from a published protocol<strong>[3]</strong>. A 50 \u00b5L aliquot of lipidome fractions was dried and resuspended in 450 \u00b5L MeOH and 50 \u00b5L 1 M KOH in MeOH. The samples were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 2 h in a Thermomixer and shaken at 1000 rpm. After this time samples were neutralized with glacial acetic acid (~1 \u00b5L) and 1000 \u00b5L CHCl3 were added and the sample shaken at 1000 rpm and 20 \u00b0C for 1 h. After addition of 500 \u00b5L H2O, samples were vortexed and phases separated by centrifugation. The lower organic phase was dried in a SpeedVac and redisolved in 50 \u00b5L iPrOH / ACN / H2O (v/v, 60 / 35 / 5) for UPLC-UHR-ToF-MS analysis.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Folch J, Lees M, Stanley GS.

Template reactions have been manually drawn and the JCReactProductStructure() reaction function in JChem for Excel was used to generate product structures. SMILES representation of fatty acid and sphingoid bases were used as input. SMILES, InChIs and InChIKeys were generated using the JCMolFormat() function in JChem for Excel. Where available, ChEBI, LipidMaps and SwissLipids IDs have been added. The full table of structures is available in the SI in the paper associated with this study.</p><p><br></p><p>Lipids were identified by manual inspection of MS2 spectra of peaks with a m/z value fitting to the predicted sphingolipid structures. Typical fragments, e.g. m/z 250.2529, m/z 268.2635 and m/z 238.2530, were used to identify C17iso sphingoid base containing sphingolipids.</p>",
