                "description": "BACKGROUND: Neutrophils are phagocytic innate immune cells that play essential roles in host defence, but are also implicated in inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) where they contribute to systemic inflammation and joint damage. Transcriptomic analysis of neutrophils has revealed significant changes in gene expression in neutrophils activated in vitro by cytokines and in vivo during inflammation in RA. However, there are no reports on the global metabolomic changes that occur during neutrophil activation. The aim of this study was to establish protocols for the study changes in the metabolome of human neutrophils using 1H NMR spectroscopy.",

                        "description": "Whole blood was collected into lithium-heparin vacutainers; the use of EDTA as an anticoagulant was avoided because extra resonance signals are observed in the NMR spectrum via the formation of complexes between EDTA and Ca2+ and Mg2+ present in plasma[1][2]. Neutrophils were isolated within 15 min of blood collection. Whole blood was mixed with HetaSep solution at a ratio of 1:5 (HetaSep:whole blood) and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min until the plasma/erythrocyte interphase was at approximately 50% of the total volume. The erythrocyte-free phase containing all nucleated blood cells was collected, and carefully layered on top of Ficoll-Paque solution at a ratio of 1:1, and then centrifuged at 500 x g for 30 min. The peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) layer, plasma, and Ficoll-Paque solution, were carefully removed, leaving a neutrophil pellet (purity typically > 97%). The pellet was resuspended in RPMI-1640 media with 25 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.4. Remaining erythrocytes were removed by hypotonic lysis with ammonium chloride buffer for 3 min, and then centrifuged at 400 x g for 3 min. The supernatant was removed, and neutrophils were re-suspended in RPMI-1640 with 25 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.4. To prepare cell pellets for metabolite extraction, neutrophils were centrifuged at 1,000 x g, at 25 \u00baC for 2 min. The supernatant was aspirated, and cell pellets were re-suspended with ice-cold PBS, then centrifuged at 1,000 x g, at 25 \u00baC for 2 min. The supernatant was discarded, while the pellets were heated at 100 \u00b0C for 1 min, and then were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. All samples were stored at -80 \u00b0C prior to intracellular metabolite extraction.\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Beckonert O, Keun HC, Ebbels TM, Bundy J, Holmes E, Lindon JC, Nicholson JK.

Student T-test were applied on the spectra after determining the data were parametric using ggplot function in R. Unsupervised multivariate analysis of the spectra was carried after out using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The data was scaled by mean centering of each variable followed by division of the square root of the standard deviation (Pareto scaling) before analysis. The PCA reduced the 300 spectral buckets of each sample to X principal components (PCs) in cells, Y PCs in tumours and Z PCs in the combined analysis (explaining 95% or the variance in each analysis). The loadings of each PCA were analysed to identify the most influential buckets (and thus metabolites) responsible for the clustering observed.",
