                "description": "Nepenthes is a genus of carnivorous plants that evolved a pitfall trap, the pitcher, to catch and digest insect prey to obtain additional nutrients. Each pitcher is part of the whole leaf, together with a leaf blade. These two completely different parts of the same organ were studied separately in a non-targeted metabolomics approach in Nepenthes x ventrata, a robust natural hybrid. The first aim was the analysis and profiling of small (50-1000 m/z) polar and non-polar molecules to find a characteristic metabolite pattern for the particular tissues. Second, the impact of insect feeding on the metabolome of the pitcher and leaf blade was studied. Using UPLC-ESI-qTOF and cheminformatics, about 2000 features (MS/MS events) were detected in the two tissues. They showed a huge chemical diversity, harboring classes of chemical substances that significantly discriminate these tissues. Among the common constituents of N. x ventrata are phenolics, flavonoids and naphthoquinones, namely plumbagin, a characteristic compound for carnivorous Nepenthales, and many yet-unknown compounds. Upon insect feeding, only in pitchers in the polar compounds fraction, small but significant differences could be detected. By further integrating information with cheminformatics approaches, we provide and discuss evidence that the metabolite composition of the tissues can point to their function.",

To avoid contamination, still-closed pitchers were covered with a mesh. Once the pitchers opened, they were left untreated for controls or prey degradation was induced by adding 30 wild-type Drosophila melanogaster, representing ca. 31 mg fresh weight. Individual pitchers represent independent biological replicates from different plants. After 72 h, pitchers were emptied, i.e. the digestive fluid with or without the remains of fruit flies was discarded, and subsequently rinsed 3 times with sterile distilled water. Next, both the tissue from the glandular zone (lower third part of the pitcher) and the related leaf blade were dissected and sampled in 50-ml Falcon tubes and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. The plant material was finely ground in liquid nitrogen using mortar and pestle. Then, ground material was stored in screw-cap Eppendorf tubes and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until further processing.</p>",

In short, double extractions of 100 mg FW tissue powder were performed in 2-ml Eppendorf tubes at room temperature, using 500 \u00b5l MeOH:ammonium acetate buffer (pH 4.8). Therefore, after 5 min shaking, a 15 min sonication in water bath followed (3x for 5 min and 3 min resting in between). Extracts were centrifuged at 20,000 x g for 10 min. Clear supernatants were combined and filtrated using a PTFE syringe filter (hydrophilic 0.22 \u00b5m pores, 13 mm diameter, Fisher Scientific, Schwerte, Germany).

Each sample represents an independent biological replicate. Extractions were done following previously described procedures<strong>[3][4]</strong> with some modifications. All steps were performed in glass test tubes and kept at room temperature. In short, an adjusted volume of methanol was added to 100 mg FW of tissue powder, based on a ratio of 150:1 v/w DW. Milli-Q water was added to a final ratio of 3:1 MeOH:H2O, taking the water content (87%) of the tissues into consideration, which was determined before. Next, samples were vortexed followed by 5 min sonication in a water bath (5x for 1 min and 1 min resting in between). Thereafter, methyl-tert-butyl ether (MTBE) was added to achieve a ratio of 10:3:1 (MTBE:MeOH:H2O). Samples were vortexed again, sonicated as previously described and shaken at 100 rpm for 1 h. Afterwards, milli-Q water was added to reach a total ratio of 20:6:7 (MTBE:MeOH:H2O). Samples were vortexed, sonicated as previously described, and shaken for 10 min. To separate them into 2 phases, samples were centrifuged at 100 x g for 20 min. The organic phase was recovered, while the aqueous phase was extracted again in 2 ml, keeping the ratio of MTBE:MeOH (20:6:7). Both organic phases were combined and evaporated under vacuum at 45 \u00b0C. The dry aqueous and organic samples were resuspended in acetonitrile:isopropanol (50:50) to a concentration equivalent to 1 g/l DW and filtrated using a PTFE syringe filter. This extract was diluted 1:10 with acetonitrile:isopropanol (50:50) and further analyzed.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> De Vos R, Schipper B, Hall RD.

Ionization was performed via pneumatic-assisted electrospray ionization in positive mode (ESI+) with a capillary voltage of 4.5 kV and an end plate offset of 500 V; a nebulizer pressure of 3 bar was used, with nitrogen at 350 \u00b0C and a flow of 12 l/min as the drying gas. Acquisition was done at 12 Hz following a mass range from 50 to 1000 m/z, with data-dependent MS/MS and an active exclusion window of 0.2 min, a reconsideration threshold of 1.8-fold change, and an exclusion range of 50\u2013150 m/z. Fragmentation was triggered on an absolute threshold of 400 and acquired on the most intense peaks using a target intensity of 20,000 counts, with MS/MS spectra acquisition between 12 and 20 Hz, and limited to a total cycle time range of 0.5 s. Collision energy was determined automatically by the software depending on m/z value. At the beginning of each run, an injection of 20 \u00b5l of a sodium formate\u2013isopropanol solution was performed in the dead volume of the injection, and the m/z values were re-calibrated using the expected cluster ion m/z values.</p><p><br></p><p>Peak detection was done using Metaboscape software (Bruker Daltonik, Bremen, Germany) with the T-Rex 3D algorithm for qTOF data. For the non-polar runs, parameters for detection were an intensity threshold of 500 with a minimum of 7 spectra, and features were kept if they were detected in at least 3 replicates of the same treatment, tissue and time (60% of n). Adducts of [M+H]+, [M+Na]+, [M+K]+, and [M+NH4]+ were grouped as a single feature if they had an EIC correlation of 0.8. For the polar runs, the intensity threshold was set to 1000, the features were kept if detected in at least 5 replicates of the same treatment and tissue (70% of n), and adducts were grouped in the same manner, only excluding the ammonium adduct, which was not expected in the polar runs. Access to the raw data in mzXML files was done in R with the aid of the mzR library.</p>",

MS/MS data was extracted for selected features using an in-house built code that searched in all samples for fragmentation events triggered in a window of 0.5 min within the feature retention time (RT). To avoid misassignation of closely eluting isobaric compounds within the RT window, the maximum of intensity in the MS1 extracted ion chromatogram (XIC) of the feature m/z (with 5 ppm error) that was closest to the feature RT was searched. Only contiguous peaks decreasing in intensity from the previous point in the MS1 XIC and with intensity higher than 10% of the maximum were kept. The new RT window was determined by the time in the first and last events. Within this new RT window, all fragmentation events whose parent ions matched the feature m/z within a 5 ppm error were stored. The fragmentation events of the most abundant 5 (non-polar) and 7 (polar) peaks for each feature adduct were merged using previously published in-house binning algorithm<strong>[2]</strong>, and saved as MASCOT generic format (MGF) files. </p><p><br></p><p>Candidate structures and database-independent fingerprint vectors were obtained by loading the above-mentioned MGF files into the SIRIUS<strong>[3]-[5]</strong> and CSI-FingerID<strong>[6]</strong> pipeline. Candidate structures for the DAFs of fed and non-fed pitchers were obtained by searching the top hit of CSI-FingerID in all databases and manually curating the results; for all the other analyses, fingerprint vectors of the top 10 candidates of all predicted formulas were exported and loaded in R. When more than one adduct was present in a feature, only the formulas that matched the formulas of the adducts were kept. Then, only fingerprints that explained more than 3 peaks and more than one third of the intensity were kept. The final selection of the fingerprint vectors was made by collapsing all the adducts per feature, only keeping the fingerprint vectors corresponding to the top-scoring candidate and those that were less than 30% different. Fingerprints were assigned as present if the highest posterior probability of fingerprint vectors and adducts was greater than 0.75, as absent if the lowest posterior probability was less than 0.25, and as uncertain otherwise. Enrichment for presence and absence were calculated via a hypergeometric test, with uncertain assignations not being considered in the probability calculations as either hits or fails. The p-values of the hypergeometric tests were corrected for multiple testing.</p><p><br></p><p>Ref:</p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Chambers MC, Maclean B, Burke R, Amodei D, Ruderman DL, Neumann S, et al.
