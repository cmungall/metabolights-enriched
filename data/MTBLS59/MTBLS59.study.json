                "description": "The development and the validation of innovative approaches for biomarker selection are of paramount importance in many -omics technologies. Unfortunately, the actual testing of new methods on real data is difficult, because in real data sets, one can never be sure about the \u201ctrue\u201d biomarkers. In this paper, we present a publicly available metabolomic ultra performance liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry spike-in data set for apples. The data set consists of 10 control samples and three spiked sets of the same size (G1,G2,G3), where naturally occurring compounds are added in different concentrations. In this sense, the data set can serve as a test bed to assess the performance of new algorithms (eg. biomarker selection, peak picking, etc.) and compare them with previously published results. The dataset includes the raw CDF files for all the injections. The raw data are organized in four assays: positive ion mode, negative ion mode, injections of the standard mixes (in both positive and negative ion modes). The spiked compounds are: epicatechin (CHEBI 90), catechin (CHEBI 15600), cyanidin-3-galactoside (CHEBI 27475), quercetin-3-galactoside (CHEBI 67486), quercetin-3-glucoside (CHEBI 28299), quercetin-3-rhamnoside (CHEBI 17558), resveratrol (CHEBI 27881), phloridzin (CHEBI 8113), quercetin (CHEBI 16243). All the compounds except resveratrol and cyanidin-3-galactoside are known to be present in the apple extracts. Spiking concentrations have been defined taking as a reference the ones measured in a pooled apple extract. A detailed description of the spiking concentration in the three group is included in the spiking.pdf file.",

The latter were divided into three aliquots and spiked with different concentrations of known compounds. The full data set, then, consists of four groups of 10 samples each. The concentrations and nature of the spiking compounds were chosen in order to simulate the conditions of a typical two-class metabolomic experiment. Some of these biomarkers are known to be naturally present in Golden Delicious apples, and for these, an artificial increase of concentration simulates their relative accumulation in tissues. Two compounds not naturally present in the matrix were also added (trans-resveratrol and cyanidin-3-galactoside), with the objective of simulating the biological synthesis of a new compound. The concentration of the biomarkers was chosen by taking as a reference the concentrations of the biomarker compounds measured in a pooled apple extract. The spiking concentration was constant in each group, but the use of different extracts conserves the absolute natural variation in marker levels between apples. As a consequence, any variation in concentration comes from analytical or biological variability. In each of the three groups, the spiking compounds are added in different concentrations, corresponding to approximate target increases of 20%, 40%, and 100%; in this way, for example, group 1 has 100% increase of quercetin-3-rhamnoside and phloridzin. The concentrations of trans-resveratrol and cyanidin-3-galactoside were chosen in such a way that the peak intensities should be in line with those of the other spike-in compounds.",

Feature detection was performed on the full data set using the matched-filter algorithm [2] with the following parameters: fwhm=20, max=50, snthresh=4, step=0.05. After peak picking, only features present in at least one-half of the 10 samples of one of the four groups were retained, thus keeping the default value for the \u201cgroup\u201d function in XCMS. A linear retention time correction was performed, followed by the re-analysis of the profile data at the positions of missing peaks (peak filling). No further processing of the peak intensities (e.g., normalization) was performed.\n</p>\nFeature list annotation was performed by the R package CAMERA [3] with default parameters. The resulting annotated peak lists contain columns giving retention time and m/z value of each feature, one column for the isotope annotation, one for the common adducts, and one for the group number. The latter is obtained by clustering the features considering their retention time and the correlation between the extracted ion chromatograms to identify co-eluting ions. As a result of this procedure, the features are grouped into groups (\u201cpcgroups\u201d), which are likely to be related to the same metabolite.\n</p>\nTo construct a data base containing the features corresponding to the spiked compounds, two standard mixtures were subject to the same analytical pipeline. The first mixture contained catechin, epicatechin, cyanidin-3-galactoside, quercetin-3-glucoside, and quercetin-3-rhamnoside; the second contained catechin, quercetin, trans-resveratrol, phloridzin, and quercetin-3-galactoside. In keeping to what was performed on the apple extract, peak picking on each chromatogram was performed by XCMS, with the same parameters used for the samples.\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Team R D C.
