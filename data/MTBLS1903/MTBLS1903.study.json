                "description": "<p>Genes are pleiotropic and getting a better knowledge of their function requires a comprehensive characterization of their mutants. Here, we generated multi-level data combining phenomic, proteomic and metabolomic acquisitions from plasma and liver tissues of two C57BL/6\u2009N mouse models lacking the Lat (linker for activation of T cells) and the Mx2 (MX dynamin-like GTPase 2) genes, respectively. Our dataset consists of 9 assays (1 preclinical, 2 proteomics and 6 metabolomics) generated with a fully non-targeted and standardized approach. The data and processing code are publicly available in the ProMetIS R package to ensure accessibility, interoperability, and reusability. The dataset thus provides unique molecular information about the physiological role of the Lat and Mx2 genes. Furthermore, the protocols described herein can be easily extended to a larger number of individuals and tissues. Finally, this resource will be of great interest to develop new bioinformatic and biostatistic methods for multi-omics data integration.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Data availability:</strong></p><p>The <strong>proteomic</strong> data generated in this study have been deposited in <strong>PRIDE</strong> repository under accession code <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD028416' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>PXD028416</strong></a> for the <strong>liver proteome</strong> and <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD028550' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>PXD028550</strong></a> for the <strong>plasma proteome</strong> [<a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride</a>].</p>",

Briefly, mice were generated on a pure C57BL/6N background using CrispR/Cas9. gRNAs were selected with the <a href='http://crispor.tefor.net/crispor.py' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>Crispor program</a> to delete a critical exon, here exon 2 for both LAT and MX2 genes, that will introduce a change in the open reading frame and the stop of translation. After microinjection in the pronucleus of C57BL/6N fertilized eggs, 16 pups were born and 6 of them had the expected deletion of exon 2 of LAT. A line was established from one founder (hash13), the size of the deletion was 242 bps. Primers F1 (CTTCTTGGTCACGCTCCTGGCTG) and R1 (ATGCTTCTTGGGTACAAACTGGCAG) were used for genotyping (WT allele: 600 bps, KO allele: 358 bps). For the MX2 gene, 15 pups were born after microinjection in C57BL/6N fertilized eggs and 2 carried the expected deletion of exon 2. A line was established from one founder (hash9), the size of the deletion was 411 bps. Primers F1 (TGGAACAGACACCTAAGTCTTGGTC) and R6 (CAGACACCAAGTGGCTTCTCCCAGG) were used for genotyping (WT allele: 856 bps, KO allele: 445 bps). The two mouse mutant mice were bred to homozygosity in 2 generations on the&nbsp;C57BL/6N genetic background and maintained in a temperature-controlled facility (20-22 \u00b0C) on a 12\u2010hour light/dark cycle (7AM-7PM) with free access to standard chow diet.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Phenotyping:</strong></p><p>The homozygous animals, 7 to 8 males and females, from the LAT and MX2 KO lines, were obtained from homozygotes breeding at the 3rd generation. Wild-type control individuals were derived from the C57BL/6N colony kept at the MCI-ICS which are maintained under the same conditions. Phenotyping data were collected between the age of 4 and 16 weeks. Both mutant mouse lines and wild-type littermates were tested through a broad-based primary phenotyping pipeline in all the major adult organ systems and most areas of major human diseases. Phenotyping tests are standardized and cross validated between centers of the consortium. All the data from mutant and wild-type are available in the <a href='https://www.mousephenotype.org' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>IMPC database</a>.

This mixture was vortexed and placed at -20 \u00b0C for 30 min. After a 10-min centrifugation (4 \u00b0C, 15493 x g, Sigma 3-16PK, Fischer Bioblok Scientific), the supernatant was divided into 2 aliquots, dried completely (EZ2.3 Genevac, Biopharma Technologies France) and stored at -80 \u00b0C until further analysis. Just before analysis, 200 \u00b5l of injection solvents (water and acetonitrile 50/50 + 0.1% formic acid) was added to the dry fractions. A pooled QC sample was prepared by mixing 5 \u00b5L from each extracted sample.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Liver:</strong></p><p>Mouse liver metabolites extraction was performed from ~25 mg of tissue. Samples were re-suspended in 170 \u00b5l of ultrapure water, and then sonicated 5 times for 10 s using a sonication probe (Vibra Cell, Bioblock Scientific, Illkirch, France). At this step, 20 \u00b5l of each sample were withdrawn for further determining the total protein concentration (colorimetric quantification / Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Courtaboeuf, France). A volume of 350 \u00b5l of methanol containing internal standards at 3.75 \u00b5g/ml was added to the remaining 150 \u00b5l of tissue lysate. Cell debris were then removed by centrifugation for 15 min at 4 \u00b0C and 20,000 x g. The resulting samples were then left on ice for 90 min until complete protein precipitation. After a final centrifugation step at 20,000 x g for 15 min at 4 \u00b0C, supernatants were recovered and split into 2 equal aliquots for C18 and HILIC analyses. Resulting aliquots were then dried under a stream of nitrogen using a TurboVap instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Courtaboeuf, France) and stored at -80 \u00b0C until analysis. Prior to LC-MS analysis, dried extracts were re-suspended to reach a fixed protein concentration (equivalent to 20 mg/ml) as described above for metabolite analysis using C18 and ZIC-pHILIC columns, respectively. After reconstitution, the tubes were vortexed and incubated in an ultrasonic bath for 5 min and then centrifuged at 20,000 x g for 15 min at 4 \u00b0C. Supernatant was transferred into 0.2 ml vials. A quality control (QC) sample was obtained by pooling 20 \u00b5l of each sample preparation. QC samples were injected every 10 samples in order to evaluate the signal variations of any metabolite, while the external standards added to all samples were used to check for consistency of signal and retention time stability throughout the experiments.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Boudah S, Olivier MF, Aros-Calt S, Oliveira L, Fenaille F, Tabet JC, Junot C.

All chromatographic systems were equipped with an on-line prefilter (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Courtaboeuf, France). Experimental settings for each LC/MS condition are described below. Mobile phases for the C18 column were 100% water in A and 100% acetonitrile in B, both containing 0.1% formic acid. Regarding HILIC, phase A consisted of an aqueous buffer of 10 mM ammonium carbonate in water adjusted to pH 10.5 with ammonium hydroxide, whereas pure acetonitrile was used as solvent B. Chromatographic elutions were achieved under gradient conditions as follows: (i) C18-based system: the flow rate was set at 500 \u00b5l/min. The elution consisted of an isocratic step of 2 min at 5% phase B, followed by a linear gradient from 5 to 100% of phase B for the next 11 min. These proportions were kept constant for 12.5 min before returning to 5% B for 4.5 min; (ii) HILIC-based system: the flow rate was 200 \u00b5l/min. Elution started with an isocratic step of 2 min at 80% B, followed by a linear gradient from 80 to 40% of phase B from 2 to 12 min.

Metabolic profiles were determined using an U3000 liquid chromatography system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA, USA) coupled to a high-resolution Bruker Impact ll UHR-QTOF (Bruker Daltonics, Wissembourg, France) equipped with an electrospray source (ESI). Chromatographic separation was performed on a Waters HSS T3 column (150 x 2.1 mm, 1.8 \u00b5m) at 0.4 ml/min, 30 \u00b0C and using an injection volume of 5 \u00b5l. Mobile phases A and B were water and acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid, respectively.

Variables whose mean intensity in the biological samples was less than 3 times that of the blanks were discarded. Variables whose linear (Pearson) correlation between the intensity in diluted quality controls (QC; pools of the biological samples) and the inverse of the dilution factor were not greater than 0.7 were discarded in the Orbitrap datasets. The signal drift was corrected for each variable by computing a loess regression on the sample intensities (span = 2). Drift estimation based on samples is of interest when the QC values do not capture the drift precisely enough, as was the case in several of the datasets. Variables with a coefficient of variation in the pools above 30% or greater than the coefficient of variation in the samples were filtered out. Chemically redundant features (i.e. isotopes, adducts, fragments) were discarded based on the conjunction of 3 criteria<strong>[4]</strong>: pearson correlation of sample profiles above 0.9, difference between retention times below 6 s, and m/z difference matching a reference list corresponding to isotopes, adducts and fragments at a 0.005 Da tolerance. Finally, intensities were log2 transformed. All these steps were performed with the <a href='https://github.com/SciDoPhenIA/phenomis' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>phenomis R package</a>. The present workflow leading to the post-processed data from the processed data is described in the '2_post_processed' vignette from the <a href='https://github.com/ProMetIS/ProMetIS' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>ProMetIS package</a>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Smith CA, Want EJ, O'Maille G, Abagyan R, Siuzdak G.
