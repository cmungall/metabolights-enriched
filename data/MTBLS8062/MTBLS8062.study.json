                "description": "<p>Aortic disease poses a significant mortality risk in adults, yet many of its underlying factors remain undiscovered. In this study, we identify mitochondrial NAD\u207a deficiency as a causal factor. Metabolomics analysis of 73 surgical aortic specimens revealed impaired NAD\u207a salvage and mitochondrial transport in diseased aortas. Precursor metabolites NMN and NAM were significantly elevated, while NAD\u207a levels were decreased, indicating a disrupted salvage biosynthesis pathway. Using mouse models, we provided mechanistic insights into the pathogenic process. The production of type III procollagen during aortic medial matrix turnover imposes a high demand for proline, an essential amino acid in collagen. A deficiency in the mitochondrial NAD\u207a pool, regulated by NAD\u207a salvage and transport, impairs proline biosynthesis in mitochondria, potentially contributing to the progression of aortic disease.</p>",
