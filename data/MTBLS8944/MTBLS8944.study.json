                "description": "<p>Goats can provide meat, milk and skins for humans and are livestock with high economic benefits. However, despite their economic significance, the comprehensive analysis of goats' serum metabolic profile and its intricate alterations throughout their developmental journey remains conspicuously absent. To investigate the stage-specificity and dynamic change characteristics of metabolites during the growth and development of goats, this study compared the alterations in serum hormone levels and serum biochemical markers across different developmental stages of female goats (1, 60, 120, 180 days old; n=5). Additionally, a serum untargeted LC-MS metabolomics analysis was conducted. A total of 504 DAMs were identified with age. The results indicated that PE, PC, Lyso-PE, Lyso-PC and FAFHA may play important roles in lipid metabolism in goats after birth. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) identified two metabolite modules (Turquoise and Yellow) and key metabolites within these modules that were significantly associated with phenotypic features. L-carnitine may be a metabolite related to muscle development in goats. The findings of this study demonstrate notable variations in serum metabolites across distinct developmental phases in goats. Lipids and organic acids play important roles in different developmental stages of goats.</p>",

Align peaks from different samples by setting retention time deviation to 0.2 min, mass deviation to 5 ppm and quantitate peak areas (signal intensity tolerance, 30%; signal/noise ratio, 3; and minimum intensity, et al). After that, peak intensities were normalized to the total spectral intensity. Subsequently, combine targeted ions and estimate molecular formulas using molecular ion peaks and fragment ions. These results can then be compared with databases such as mzCloud (https://www.mzcloud.org/), mzVault and Masslist for further analysis. To remove any background ions, utilize blank samples and normalize the initial quantification outcomes according to the following formula: the quantification value of the raw sample / (sum of quantification values for all metabolites in the sample / total quantification values of metabolites in QC sample) to obtain relative peak areas. Finally, delete compounds with CVs greater than 30% from the QC sample to obtain the identification and relative quantification results of metabolites<strong>[1]</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p>The biological functional annotation of metabolites was conducted utilizing Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG; http://www.kegg.com), LIPID MAPS (Lipidmaps; www.lipidmaps.org) and Human Metabolome Database (HMDB; http://www.hmdb.ca). The metaX software (version 1.4.2)<strong>[2]</strong> was employed for PCA and PLS-DA analyses, and the variable importance in projection (VIP) was calculated. Differential metabolites were selected based on VIP&gt;1, P&lt;0.05, FC&gt;1.5 or FC&lt;0.67. P-value of metabolites between the 2 groups was evaluated through T-tests. Furthermore, metabolic pathway enrichment analysis of differential metabolites was carried out using the KEGG database.
