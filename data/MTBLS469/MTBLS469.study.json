                "description": "<p><strong>PURPOSE:</strong> Validated biomarkers of food intake (BFIs) have recently been suggested as a useful tool to assess adherence to dietary guidelines or compliance in human dietary interventions. Although many new candidate biomarkers have emerged in the last decades for different foods from metabolic profiling studies, the number of comprehensively validated biomarkers of food intake is limited. Apples are among the most frequently consumed fruits and a rich source of polyphenols and fibers, an important mediator for their health-protective properties.</p><p><strong><span class='ql-cursor'>\ufeff</span>METHODS:</strong> Using an untargeted metabolomics approach, we aimed to identify biomarkers of long-term apple intake and explore how apples impact on the human plasma and urine metabolite profiles. Forty mildly hypercholesterolemic volunteers consumed two whole apples or a sugar and energy-matched control beverage, daily for 8&nbsp;weeks in a randomized, controlled, crossover intervention study. The metabolome in plasma and urine samples was analyzed via untargeted metabolomics.</p><p><strong>RESULTS:</strong> We found 61 urine and 9 plasma metabolites being statistically significant after the whole apple intake compared to the control beverage, including several polyphenol metabolites that could be used as BFIs. Furthermore, we identified several endogenous indole and phenylacetyl-glutamine microbial metabolites significantly increasing in urine after apple consumption. The multiomic dataset allowed exploration of the correlations between metabolites modulated significantly by the dietary intervention and fecal microbiota species at genus level, showing interesting interactions between Granulicatella genus and phenyl-acetic acid metabolites. Phloretin glucuronide and phloretin glucuronide sulfate appeared promising biomarkers of apple intake; however, robustness, reliability and stability data are needed for full BFI validation.</p><p><strong>CONCLUSION:</strong> The identified apple BFIs can be used in future studies to assess compliance and to explore their health effects after apple intake. Moreover, the identification of polyphenol microbial metabolites suggests that apple consumption mediates significant gut microbial metabolic activity which should be further explored.</p>",

Briefly, the trial was a randomized, controlled, crossover, dietary intervention in 40 mildly hypercholesterolemic (total cholesterol levels &gt; 5.2 mmol/l) and otherwise healthy volunteers (23 women, 17 men,), aged 29\u201369 years, with BMI 19\u201333 kg/m^2. Volunteers were recruited from the general population living in Reading, Berkshire, UK, and the study was conducted at the Hugh Sinclair Unit of Human Nutrition, University of Reading.</p><p><br></p><p>Subjects were randomly allocated to 1 of 2 groups to receive daily either 2 whole apples (Renetta Canada, 340 g containing 990 mg polyphenols and 8.5 g total fibre) or a sugar and energy-matched control beverage low in apple polyphenols (100 ml concentrated apple beverage containing 2.5 mg polyphenols and no fibre).</p><p><br></p><p>Prior to the first intervention period, subjects performed a 2 week run-in period, where they maintained their habitual diet but refrained from eating probiotics, prebiotics and any apples, apple juice or apple-containing foods. The first group (n = 22) consumed 2 apples daily for 8 weeks, and after a 4-week washout period, a sugar and energy-matched control apple beverage daily for an additional 8 weeks. The second group (n = 18) received the intervention in the reverse order (first the control beverage and then the 2 apples). Subjects were requested to incorporate the intervention products, apples or control beverage, into their normal diet without changing further their habitual intake. Biological samples, including fasted plasma, fecal samples and 24 h urine collections were collected before and after each dietary intervention at week 1, 8, 12 and 20.</p><p><br></p><p>For each volunteer, blood samples were collected into separate vacutainer tubes (Greiner Bio-One Ltd, Stonehouse, UK) containing ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) or lithium heparin anticoagulants. After collection, the tubes were immediately put on ice for transportation to the laboratory. Cells were then removed from plasma by centrifugation for 15 min at 1800 x g using refrigerated centrifuge. Aliquots (0.5 ml) of the supernatant (plasma) were immediately transferred into clean cryogenic (polypropylene) vials using a Pasteur pipette and stored at -80 \u00b0C. Serum was also collected in appropriate vacutainer tubes (serum separator tubes), containing a clot activator. The blood was allowed to clot by leaving the tube undisturbed at room temperature for 30 min. Then, the supernatant (serum) was collected after centrifugation at 1800 x g, 4 \u00b0C for 15 min and aliquots were put into separate cryogenic vials for storage at -20 \u00b0C.&nbsp;For the collection of the urine, volunteers were provided with a urine pot containing 10 ml of 1 M HCL, ice packs and an isothermic bag and they were instructed to start collecting the sample the morning before the study visit and for 24 h. Once the urine was received in the lab, pH was reduced with the further addition of 1 M HCL to 4, then centrifuged at 1800 x g, 4 \u00b0C for 10 min, aliquoted and stored at -80 \u00b0C until further analysis. Urine volume was also recorded.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Koutsos A, Riccadonna S, Ulaszewska MM, Franceschi P, Tro\u0161t K, Galvin A, Braune T, Fava F, Perenzoni D, Mattivi F, Tuohy KM, Lovegrove JA.

Profiling of the data was processed with XCMS<strong>[2]</strong> using the 'matched-Filter' peak picking method. A signal to noise ratio cutoff of 4 was used, full width at half maximum was set to 10 s and a step size of 0.005 Da was used for extracting chromatograms. The resulting feature matrix was annotated using CAMERA<strong>[3]</strong> to group features corresponding to the same parent ion species.</p><p><br></p><p>To identify the features showing a significant difference between the meals, 2 independent linear mixed models were fitted to each mass feature. In the first model, the concentration of each feature was modeled as a function of meal, the gender of the subject and the individual. Interactions were tested for significance and left out, since they were non-significant for all features. In the second model, the effect of meal was left out. The comparison of the 2 models allowed us to identify the features significantly affected by the meal factor. The p values were obtained using likelihood ratio tests and the collection of p values was corrected for multiple testing by controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) and the q values were calculated<strong>[4][5]</strong>. Post hoc multiple comparison tests (p values uncorrected) were performed to determine the specific effects between means and the collection of p values corrected as above. Urine samples were normalized to the creatinine content. For the plasma samples, feature-wise batch correction was performed such that that the mean intensity for each batch was the same.

Molecular ion and in-source molecular fragments were assigned as 1 compound based on a mass accuracy approach and peak shape, as many were statistically significant. Discriminative markers were then compared with the monoisotopic molecular weight, chemical structures and LC-MS/MS spectra of metabolites proposed by freely available databases: m/z Cloud (<a href='www.mzcloud.org' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>www.mzcloud.org</a>); Human Metabolome DB<strong>[1]</strong>, METLIN<strong>[2]</strong>, MassBank<strong>[3]</strong> and LIPID MAPS<strong>[4]</strong> databases. Mass accuracy was set to 2 mDa while searching on-line. Additionally, information from MSn experiments were introduced to Met-Fusion<strong>[5]</strong> to get candidate structures. Final identification was achieved after a combination of LC-HRMS2, LC-HRMS3 experiments, on-line database information and literature verification. The levels of identification reported in Tables 1 and 2 in the paper associated with this study, are as follows: Level I corresponds to compounds identified by matching masses and retention times with authentic standards in the laboratory using the same analytical method; Level II corresponds to compounds identified by LC\u2013HRMS, LC\u2013HRMS2 and/or LC\u2013HRMSn spectra and matched to spectra from databases and literature. Compounds identified only by spectral similarities to a similar compound class and literature knowledge are reported as Level III. Unknown compounds are reported as Level IV.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Wishart DS, Knox C, Guo AC, Eisner R, Young N, Gautam B, et al. (2009).
