The PPL cartridges were first rinsed with 6 ml of methanol and then the filtrate was pulled through the cartridge via PTFE tubing using a vacuum pump. The cartridge was rinsed with 4 cartridge volumes of 0.01 M HCl and then allowed to dry by pulling air over the cartridge for 5 min. The sample was then eluted with 6 ml of methanol into a glass test tube and transferred with a glass pipette to an 8 ml amber vial<strong>[1][2]</strong>. Once samples returned to land, the methanol extracts were evaporated to near dryness using a Vacufuge (Eppendorf) and reconstituted in MQ water with isotopically-labeled standards. A pooled sample was created by sub-sampling an aliquot of all samples. A dilution curve of the pooled sample was created by diluting a pooled sample 1.3-, 2-, and 4- fold with MQ water.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Dittmar T, Koch B, Hertkorn N, Kattner G.

                        "description": "<p>An Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Tribid mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used for mass spectrometry. The electrospray voltage was set to 2600 V for negative mode and 3600 V for positive mode. Settings for source gases were 55 (sheath) and 20 (auxiliary) and these settings are presented in arbitrary units. The heated capillary temperature was 350 \u00b0C and the vaporizer temperature was 400 \u00b0C. MS data were collected in the Orbitrap analyzer with a mass resolution of 120,000 FWHM at m/z 200. The automatic gain control (AGC) target was 4e^5, the maximum injection time was 50 ms, and the scan range was 100-1000 m/z. Internal mass calibration of the Orbitrap analyzer was used to improve mass accuracy of the MS scan. Data-dependent <strong>MS/MS</strong> data were acquired in the Orbitrap analyzer using higher energy collisional dissociation (HCD) with a normalized collision energy of 35% and with mass resolution of 7500. The AGC target value for fragmentation spectra was 5e^4 and the intensity threshold was 2e^4. Cycle time was set at 0.6 s. Precursor selection was performed within the quadrupole with a 1 m/z isolation window. Dynamic exclusion was enabled, with 3 s exclusion duration after n=1. All data were collected in profile mode. 5 \u03bcl injection of each sample was run in both positive and negative ion modes in a random order.&nbsp;Pooled samples were run after every 5 samples to assess instrument performance and drift over the sample run and batches. At the end of each batch, MQ blanks were injected 2x and a unique process blank was injected 3x. In the last batch, each of the pooled sample dilutions was injected in sequential order 3x, starting with the highest dilution (4-fold) and ending with no dilution (0-fold).</p>",

Peaks were filtered based on Gaussian fits with root mean square errors less than or equal to 0.125. Peaks were further filtered with refineChromPeaks. Any peaks with a maximum peakwidth &gt; 40s were removed (<strong>CleanPeaksParam</strong>). Any peaks that were artificially split were merged (<strong>MergeNeighboringPeaksParam</strong>) by binning peaks with a similar m/z (\u00b1 10ppm) and retention time (\u00b1 4s), and subsequently merging if the intensity half-way between the 2 peaks was &gt; 75% of the smallest of the 2 peak\u2019s intensities. Retention times were adjusted using <strong>Orbiwarp</strong> (binSize = 0.1). Pool samples were used as the subset to define the retention time adjustments, and these alignments were subsequently interpolated and applied to all other samples. Correspondence (bw = 0.7, binSize = 0.025) between the peaks was conducted. Finally, <strong>fillChromPeaks</strong> was used to fill in any peaks missed originally by searching each feature\u2019s retention time and m/z (\u00b1 25ppm). Feature values were integrated by the \u2018<strong>maxint</strong>\u2019 method. <strong>MS1</strong> features were defined as unique combinations of mass-to-charge ratios (m/z) and retention times (RT). Feature intensities were batch corrected using the <strong>BatchCorrMetabolomics</strong> package with a robust least-squares regression and then normalized based on volume filtered<strong>[3]</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Chambers MC, Maclean B, Burke R, Amodei D, Ruderman DL, Neumann S, Gatto L, Fischer B, Pratt B, et al.
