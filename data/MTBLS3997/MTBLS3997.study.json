                "description": "<p>Multicellular organisms such as plants contain various cell types with specialized functions. Analyzing the characteristics of each cell type reveals specific cell functions and enhances our understanding of organization and function at the organismal level. Guard cells (GCs) are specialized epidermal cells that regulate the movement of the stomata and gaseous exchange, and provide a model genetic system for analyzing cell fate, signaling and function. Several proteomics analyses of GC are available, but these are limited in depth. Here we used enzymatic isolation and flow cytometry to enrich GC and mesophyll cell protoplasts and perform in-depth proteomics in these two major cell types in Arabidopsis leaves. We identified approximately 3000 proteins not previously found in the GC proteome and more than 600 proteins that may be specific to GC. The depth of our proteomics enabled us to uncover a guard cell-specific kinase cascade whereby Raf15 and Snf1-related kinase2.6 (SnRK2.6)/OST1(open stomata 1) mediate abscisic acid (ABA)-induced stomatal closure. RAF15 directly phosphorylated SnRK2.6/OST1 at the conserved Ser175 residue in its activation loop and was sufficient to reactivate the inactive form of SnRK2.6/OST1. ABA-triggered SnRK2.6/OST1 activation and stomatal closure was impaired in raf15 mutants. We also showed enrichment of enzymes and flavone metabolism in GC, and consistent, dramatic accumulation of flavone metabolites. Our study answers the long-standing question of how ABA activates SnRK2.6/OST1 in GCs and represents a resource potentially providing further insights into the molecular basis of GC and mesophyll cell development, metabolism, structure and function.</p>",

After 1 h digestion, the peels were filtered with 100 \u00b5m mesh and placed into 10 mL enzyme solution II containing 1.3% cellulose Onozuka RS (Yakult Pharmaceutical Industry), 0.0075% Pectolyase Y-23 (Yakult Pharmaceutical Industry), 0.25% BSA, and 0.5 mM L-ascorbic acid 5 mM MES, pH 5.5, 0.5 mM CaCl2, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 10 \u00b5M KH2PO4 and 0.5 M sorbitol at 20 \u00b0C, 60 rpm for 2 h. The digestion mixture was filtered with 40 \u00b5m mesh (Falcon) and the GCP were collected by centrifuge at 200 x g for 5 min. The protoplasts were resuspended in the solution II without enzyme and sorted with the cytometry (ARIA III Cell sorter, BD bioscience) with the GFP signal and single-cell pattern to isolate the high purity (~100%) fluorescent protoplasts. The indicated number of cells were collected by centrifuge and used for protein extraction for LC-MS/MS.</p><p><br></p><p>For isolating of Arabidopsis MCP, leaf strips were excised from the middle parts of young rosette leaves, dipped in enzyme solution containing 1.35% cellulase R10 (Yakult Pharmaceutical Industry) and 0.268% macerozyme R10 (Yakult Pharmaceutical Industry) and incubated at room temperature in the dark. The protoplast solution was diluted with an equal volume of W5 solution (2 mM MES, pH 5.7, 154 mM NaCl, 125 mM CaCl2 and 5 mM KCl) and \ufb01ltered through a nylon mesh.
