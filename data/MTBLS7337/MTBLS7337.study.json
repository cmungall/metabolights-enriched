                "description": "<p>The post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), also known as long COVID, is often associated with debilitating symptoms and adverse multisystem consequences. We obtain plasma samples from 117 individuals during and 6&nbsp;mth following their acute phase of infection to comprehensively profile and assess changes in cytokines, proteome, and metabolome. Network analysis reveals sustained inflammatory response, platelet degranulation, and cellular activation during convalescence accompanied by dysregulation in arginine biosynthesis, methionine metabolism, taurine metabolism, and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle processes. Furthermore, we develop a prognostic model composed of 20 molecules involved in regulating T&nbsp;cell exhaustion and energy metabolism that can reliably predict adverse clinical outcomes following discharge from acute infection with 83% accuracy and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.96. Our study reveals pertinent biological processes during convalescence that differ from acute infection, and it supports the development of specific therapies and biomarkers for patients suffering from long COVID.</p>",

All enrolled patients were \u2265 18 yr of age with a laboratory-confirmed <strong>COVID-19</strong> diagnosis based on a positive <strong>SARS-CoV-2</strong> real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay from nasopharyngeal swabs or lower respiratory samples. Comparisons were made with age and sex-matched <strong>healthy controls</strong> (n=28) enrolled during the same period. Our study was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles for the Declaration of Helsinki with approval from the University of Alberta Health Research Ethics Board (Pro00100319 and Pro00100207).

The method uses <strong>chemical derivatization</strong> (for<strong> biogenic amines</strong> and <strong>organic acids</strong>), <strong>analyte extraction</strong> and<strong> LC separation</strong> (<strong>or direct injection</strong> for<strong> lipids</strong> and <strong>acylcarnitines</strong>), combined with selective mass-spectrometric detection using multiple reaction monitoring (<strong>MRM</strong>) pairs to identify and quantify metabolites.&nbsp;</p>",

To extract and measure <strong>all metabolites except organic acids</strong>, plasma samples were first thawed on ice, then vortexed and centrifuged at 13,000 x g.

After incubation, the filter spots were dried again using an evaporator. Extraction of the metabolites was then achieved by adding an <strong>ammonium acetate/methanol</strong> mixture (5 mM ammonium acetate dissolved in 300 \u03bcL methanol).
