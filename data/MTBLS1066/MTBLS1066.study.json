                "description": "The application of ketogenic diet (KD) (high fat/low carbohydrate/adequate protein) as an auxiliary cancer therapy is a field of growing attention. KD provides sufficient energy supply for healthy cells, while possibly impairing energy production in highly glycolytic tumor cells. Moreover, KD regulates insulin and tumor related growth factors (like insulin growth factor-1, IGF-1). In order to provide molecular evidence for the proposed additional inhibition of tumor growth when combining chemotherapy with KD, we applied untargeted quantitative metabolome analysis on a spontaneous breast cancer xenograft mouse model, using MDA-MB-468 cells. Healthy mice and mice bearing breast cancer xenografts and receiving cyclophosphamide chemotherapy were compared after treatment with control diet and KD. Metabolomic profiling was performed on plasma samples, applying high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. Statistical analysis revealed metabolic fingerprints comprising numerous significantly regulated features in the group of mice bearing breast cancer. This fingerprint disappeared after treatment with KD, resulting in recovery to the metabolic status observed in healthy mice receiving control diet. Moreover, amino acid metabolism as well as fatty acid transport were found to be affected by both the tumor and the applied KD. Our results provide clear evidence of a significant molecular effect of adjuvant KD in the context of tumor growth inhibition and suggest additional mechanisms of tumor suppression beyond the proposed constrain in energy supply of tumor cells.",

Xenografts were established as previously described[1][2]. Briefly, a suspension of 1.5 x 10^7 MDA-MB-468 cells in serum-free medium and matrigel (BD Biosciences, Austria) were injected into the right flank of 5- to 6-week-old mice.</p><p><br></p><p>As soon as tumor size reached 300\u2013350 mm^3 (i.e., 2\u20135 weeks after injection of tumor cells), mice were randomized into different dietary intervention groups (CTRL, LCT-MCT8; n = 5\u20136)[1]. As mice are able to keep blood glucose levels and show lower ketosis on 2:1 to 4:1 diets, compared to humans, we decided to use an 8:1 diet in our mouse model, to reach at least a ketosis over 2 mmol/l. Dietary interventions were combined with oral metronomic chemotherapy with CPA (30 mg/kg). The healthy, 7 weeks old, mice were fed with the experimental diets (CTRL, LCT-MCT8; see Table S2 in the paper associated with this study)[1][2]. All animals were monitored twice a week for body weight using a digital scale. Blood glucose and ketone body (beta-hydroxybutyrate) levels were monitored once a week using a specific enzyme-based kit (Precision Xceed, Abbott Laboratories, Vienna, Austria). Tumor volume was measured twice a week in the xenografts bearing mice, by using a caliper and calculating the volume according to the formula 4/3 Pi \u00d7 d1/2 \u00d7 d2/2 \u00d7 d3/2 (d\u2014dimension).</p><p><br></p><p>Breast cancer bearing mice were euthanized after 80 days of treatment, whereas healthy mice after 40 days. Therefore, mice were injected with 10 \u03bcl/g of anesthetic mix (ketamine 20.5 mg/mL, xylazine 5.4 mg/mL, acepromazine 270 \u03bcg/ml in saline solution), and after checking for absence of reflexes from the paw, heart puncture was performed. Mice were then immediately euthanized via head-neck dislocation. Blood was transferred into tubes (BD Microtainer\u00ae PSTTM LH tubes; BD Biosciences, Vienna, Austria) and plasma was collected as described in the manufacture\u2019s protocol, and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen[1][2].</p><p><br></p><p>Ref:</p><p>[1] Aminzadeh-Gohari S., Feichtinger R.G., Vidali S., Locker F., Rutherford T., O\u2019Donnel M., St\u00f6ger-Kleiber A., Mayr J.A., Sperl W., Kofler B.

A quality control sample (pool) was generated by merging an aliquot (10 \u00b5l) of all samples included in the study. Prior to injection into the UHPLC-MS system, samples and pools were diluted 1:5 with Millipore water for reversed phase mode and 1:3 with acetonitrile (VWR, Rednor, PA, USA) for HILIC mode separation.</p><p><br></p><p>Each sequence started with 3 blank runs, followed by 3 pool injections and finished with 1 pool and 1 blank run. In between, a blank run and a pool run were conducted after every third sample. Each sample was measured in 4 different selectivity and ionization mode combinations, which were RP\u2014positive ionization, RP\u2014negative ionization, HILIC\u2014positive ionization, and HILIC\u2014negative ionization, resulting in 4 data sets per study. For each combination an exclusion list of the 100 most abundant ions obtained from prior blank runs was generated, to avoid MS fragmentation of chemical or electronic noise signals.</p><p><br></p><p>For RP-UHPLC separations, a 100 x 2.1 mm i.d. Hypersil Gold aQ column (Thermo Fisher Scientific) packed with 1.9 \u00b5m octadecyl silica particles was applied. For column protection, a 4.0 x 3.0 mm i.d. C18 Security Guard pre-column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA) was installed. In reversed phase mode, mobile phase A and B were Millipore water and acetonitrile, both containing 0.10% formic acid (Sigma-Aldrich). The HPLC method started with holding 100% A for 1.5 min, followed by a linear gradient to 100% B in 6.5 min. After washing for 2.0 min at 100% B, the column was re-equilibrated to starting conditions for 3.0 min, resulting in a total run time of 13.0 min.</p><p><br></p><p>HILIC-UHPLC separations were performed using a 150 x 2.0 mm i.d.

Nucleodur HILIC 1.8 \u00b5m pre-column, also from Macherey-Nagel was applied to protect the column. In the HILIC mode, mobile phase A contained 50 mM ammonium formate in 50% acetonitrile, while mobile phase B was 10 mM ammonium formate (Sigma-Aldrich) in 90% acetonitrile.

Scan range and resolution of MS1 scans were set to 80\u2013850 m/z and 70,000, respectively, using an AGC target of 1 x 10^6 and a maximum injection time of 50 ms. The 5 most abundant ions of the MS1 scan were isolated with an isolation window of 0.8 m/z, fragmented via HCD applying stepped normalized collision energies of 20, 40, 60 and acquired in centroid mode. The maximum injection time was set to 64 ms with an AGC target of 5 x 10^4 at a resolution of 17,500. In addition to an exclusion of charges greater than 2, dynamic exclusion of 5.0 s was used, in order to avoid multiple fragmentations of the same ions. Using these settings, all samples were measured in the positive and negative ionization mode in separated sequences for each selectivity and ionization mode. Tune parameters were a capillary temperature of 320 \u00b0C, a probe heater temperature of 350 \u00b0C and an S-lens level of 50 for both ionization modes. Differing settings were a sprayer voltage of 4.0 and 3.5 kV, sheath gas flow rate of 35 and 45, as well as an auxiliary gas flow rate of 5 and 10 in positive and negative ionization mode, respectively.</p>",

The resulting files were further processed using a bioinformatic workflow in the Konstanz Information Miner (KNIME) [1], version 3.3.4 with integrated OpenMS 2.1.0 software [2] (see Tables S3\u2013S7 in the paper associated with this study for detailed settings). The applied KNIME workflow can be accessed here https://www.myexperiment.org/workflows/5109.html. After peak picking, feature detection and feature alignment, data was filtered, normalized and statistically evaluated using Linear Models for Microarray Data (LIMMA) [3] followed by Benjamini-Hochberg correction [4] for multiple testing.</p><p><br></p><p>The MTX study design and data treatment involved stringent filtering of 'noise' signals or such originating from the chemical background, which enabled the reduction of chemical and electronic artefacts. Along that line, the HPLC-MS signals were aligned retention time wise, followed by exclusion of features that did not exceed a threshold of 5-fold the median intensity of the corresponding signal in the blank from further data processing. In the next step, data was normalized via a robust regression to account for variations occurring during sample preparation and measurement. Features showing instable signals in the quality control runs and those not being present in a sufficient number of replicates or treatment conditions were removed. Filtering was based on peak area threshold in blank runs, as well as on relative standard deviation in quality control samples and occurrence in biological replicates. </p><p><br></p><p>Ref:</p><p>[1] Berthold, M.R.; Cebron, N.; Dill, F.; Gabriel, T.R.; K\u00f6tter, T.; Meinl, T.; Ohl, P.; Thiel, K.; Wiswedel, B.
