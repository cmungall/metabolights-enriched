It is mainly controlled by chemosynthetic fungicides, which endangers ecosystem and human health; thus, there is an urgent need to explore alternatives for these fungicides. In this study, a new anti-oomycete aliphatic compound was obtained through co-culture of <em>Bacillus subtilis</em> and <em>Trichoderma asperellum</em>. The action mode of this natural product on <em>P. nicotianae</em> was preliminarily explored by using transcriptome, metabolome and physiological index detection.</p>",

The spores of <em>T. asperellum</em> HG1 were obtained by washing the 5-day-old culture with sterile water, followed by filteration through degreasing cotton. The number of spores was counted using an automatic cell counter (Countstar IC1000, Shanghai, China), and diluted to 1 x 10^6 spores/mL as spore suspension. <em>B. subtilis</em> Tpb55 was transferred from 2-day-old culture in LA medium into NB broth and incubated overnight (28 \u00b0C, 180 rpm/min), following which the number of cells was measured using a microplate reader (SP-Max 2300A2, Flash, China) and diluted to 1 x 10^6 CFU/mL as a seed liquid. The spore suspension of <em>T. asperellum</em> HG1 (5 mL, 10^6/mL) was inoculated in NB medium (250 mL/500 mL bottle) and cultured for 24 h (28 \u00b0C and 180 rpm), followed by inoculation with <em>B. subtilis</em> Tpb55 (0.5 mL, 10^6/mL); the fermentation was continued for 7 days.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Isolation and identification of DDA</strong></p><p>The fermentation filtrate from the co-culture of <em>T. asperellum</em> HG1 and <em>B. subtilis</em> Tpb55 was extracted by EtOAc 3 times, then evaporated under vacuum to obtain the final extract (9.4 g). The extract was separated using a Sephadex LH-20 chromatography column (CC) (CH2Cl2/MeOH, v/v, 1:1) after being eluted on silica gel CC with 10% EtOAc-petroleum ether. It was further purified by HPLC (Waters e2695-2998, Waters, Milford, MA, USA) using MeOH-H2O (75%) with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) to yield DDA (3.2 mg). The DDA structure was identified using 1H and 13C NMR (DD2 500 MHz NMR spectrometer, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA), and ESI (Micromass Q-TOF spectrometer, Waters) spectra and compared to the literature and the standard compound purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals Inc.

The reaction mixture was agitated at 0 \u00b0C for 10 min before moved to room temperature (25 \u00b0C) for stirring overnight, followed by filteration to remove the residue and rinsing with 3x 5 mL acetone. The filtrate was dried and redissolved in 20 mL EtOAc. The organic solution was washed with distilled water (3x 10 mL); subsequently, 4 M NaOH was added to the EtOAc phase until a pH of 8-9 was reached and extracted with 10 mL distilled water (x3). Hydrochloric acid (4 M) was added to the combined aqueous phases until the pH reached 1-2. The solution was extracted with 10 mL EtOAc (x3), and the mixed organic extracts were washed with saturated NaCl solution (3x 20 mL) and then condensed in a vacuum to yield residues. The reaction was monitored by TLC using Yantai Jiangyou (Yantai, China) GF254 silica gel plates. The obtained residues were initially purified by silica gel CC with gradient elution of EtOAc-petroleum ether from 10% to 100%, then separated on an ODS column eluted with 30-90% MeOH:H2O and purified on Sephadex LH-20 CC (CH2Cl2/MeOH, v/v, 1/1), followed by purification by HPLC using 70% MeOH\u2013H2O + 0.1% TFA to yield DDA.

After filtering, minimum metabolite values were imputed for specific samples in which the metabolite levels fell below the lower limit of quantitation and each metabolic features were normalized by sum. The internal standard was used for data QC (reproducibility), metabolic features which the relative standard deviation (RSD) of QC &gt; 30% were discarded. Following normalization procedures and imputation, statistical analysis was performed on log transformed data to identify significant differences in metabolite levels between comparable groups.
