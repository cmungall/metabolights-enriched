                "description": "Untargeted metabolomics is an established approach in toxicology for characterising endogenous metabolic responses to xenobiotic exposure. Detecting the xenobiotic and its biotransformation products as part of the metabolomics analysis provides an opportunity to simultaneously gain deep insights into its fate and metabolism, and to associate the xenobiotic\u2019s internal relative dose directly with endogenous metabolic responses. This integration of untargeted exposure and response measurements into a single assay has yet to be fully demonstrated. Here we assembled a workflow to discover and analyse xenobiotic-related measurements from routine untargeted UHPLC-MS metabolomics datasets, derived from in vivo (rat plasma and cardiac tissue, and human plasma) and in vitro (human cardiomyocytes) studies that were principally designed to investigate endogenous metabolic responses to drug exposure. Our findings clearly demonstrate how untargeted metabolomics can discover extensive xenobiotic biotransformation maps, temporally-changing relative systemic exposure, and direct associations of endogenous biochemical responses to the internal dose.",

Sunitinib and KU60648 were formulated in 20% w/v aqueous (2-hydroxypropyl)-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (HP-\u03b2-CD) and administered orally. Sunitinib-exposed rats (groups 6 and 8) were dosed with 25 mg/kg/day (10 ml/kg/day) of sunitinib malate for 14 d. KU60648-exposed rats (groups 2 and 4) were dosed with 150 mg/kg/day (10 ml/kg/day) for 2 d, then with 225 mg/kg/day (10 ml/kg/day) on day 3. These doses were considered suitable for investigation based on previous studies demonstrating tolerance to these doses, i.e., approximately the maximum tolerated doses.</p><p><br></p><p>Blood samples for untargeted metabolomics were taken on days 1 and 2 (groups 1-4), days 1 and 4 (groups 5-6) or days 2 and 8 (groups 7-8) at 4 h post-dose. Terminal samples were also taken 24 h post-dose (day 4, groups 1-4) and 28 h post-dose (day 15, groups 5 \u2013 8). 300 \u03bcl whole blood was collected via the tail vein, mixed with Lith Hep anticoagulant, and used to derive approximately 150 \u03bcl of plasma for analysis. </p><p><br></p><p>KU60648-exposed rats (groups 2 and 4) and corresponding vehicle controls (groups 1 and 3) were terminated on day 4. Sunitinib-exposed rats (groups 6 and 8) and corresponding vehicle-controls (groups 5 and 7) were terminated on day 15.

(Each well formed a time-point N, and was repeated from 3 separate vials). After plating in Cardiomyocyte plating media, cells were cultured in Cardiomyocyte maintence media from 48 h post plating, until end of experiment. 10 d post-plating, the cardiomyocytes were treated with either 0.1% DMSO (control) or 5 \u03bcM sunitinib (treated), for either 1, 6 or 24 h, added as part of a media change. This concentration was selected as one that would elicit a toxicologically-relevant molecular response without significant loss in cell viability, i.e., approximately the maximum tolerated dose, based on previous studies. Once the exposure time had elapsed, plates were placed on wet ice, the media was removed (to microcentrifuge tubes), then wells were washed twice with 1 ml cold 0.9% NaCl. Plates were then immediately frozen on dry ice. Media samples were spun at 10,000 x g for 5 min at 4 \u00b0C to remove any cell debris. The supernatants were then transferred to new microcentrifuge tubes.

Tissue sizes ranged from 54-124 mg. 8 \u03bcl/mg wet tissue mass of ice-cold methanol (LC-MS grade, VWR International, UK) and 3.2 \u03bcl/mg ice-cold water (LC-MS grade, VWR International, UK) was added to frozen tissue samples, which were homogenised in a bead-based homogenisation system (Precellys 24 with CK28 tubes, Stretton Scientific, UK). The homogenate was transferred to a 1.8 ml glass vial and 8 \u03bcl/mg ice-cold chloroform (HPLC grade, Fisher Scientific, UK) and 4 \u03bcl/mg water were added. Sample was vortexed (30 s), left on ice (10 min, for extraction) and centrifuged (2500 x g, 4 \u00b0C, 10 min). Sample was set at room temperature (approximately 20 \u00b0C) for 5 min to complete phase partitioning. Fixed volumes of the polar (400 \u03bcl \u2013 equivalent to 30 mg extracted tissue) and non-polar (250 \u03bcl \u2013 equivalent to 30 mg extracted tissue) were removed and dried in a SpeedVac sample concentrator (Savant SPD111V230, Thermo Fisher Scientific) or a nitrogen blow down drier (Techne FSC400D, Thermo Fisher Scientific), respectively. Samples were stored at -80 \u00b0C until analysis. To create polar quality control (QC) samples an extra 300 \u03bcl of the polar extract (post-bi-phase partition) was taken from each sample, mixed (vortexed 30 s) and aliquoted (400 \u03bcl) before drying by SpeedVac. To create non-polar quality control (QC) samples an extra 200 \u03bcl of the non-polar extract (post-bi-phase partition) was taken from each sample, mixed (vortexed 30 s) and aliquoted (250 \u03bcl) before drying by nitrogen blow down drier. Extract blank samples were created by carrying out the above procedure in the absence of tissue.

Cardiomyocytes were dislodged into the solvent using a cell scraper (Corning) and all cardiomyocytes and liquid were removed into a fresh 1.8 ml glass vial. A further 240 \u03bcl of pre-chilled 2:0.8 methanol:water was added to the well, scraped and all contents added to the 1.8 ml glass vial. 600 \u03bcl ice-cold chloroform and 300 \u03bcl ice-cold water were added to the 1.8 ml glass vial and sample was vortexed (30 s), left on ice (10 min, for extraction) and centrifuged (2500 x g, 4 \u00b0C, 10 min).

Full scan (MS1) data deconvolution was performed by XCMS operated in Galaxy<strong>[2]</strong>, as reported previously<strong>[3]</strong> (settings: min. peak width (HILIC = 4; RP C18 = 6); max. peak width (30); ppm (HILIC = 12; RP C18 = 14); mzdiff (0.001); bw (0.25); mzwid (0.01); minfrac (0.2 for rat and cardiomyocyte datasets, 0.05 for huamn dataset)). A data matrix of peak intensities for metabolite features (m/z-retention time pairs) vs. samples were constructed. MS2 data files were processed, filtered and averaged using the R/Bioconductor package msPurity<strong>[4]</strong> (settings: XCMS (as described above except minfrac (0.1)), plim (0.5), ppm (5.0)). Processed MS2 spectra were aligned to metabolite features in the peak matrix generated from full scan (MS1) data files using 5 ppm mass error and 10 s retention time tolerance window.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Endogenous-based data analysis:</strong></p><p>Prior to data analysis, datasets were filtered as follows: any feature whose median intensity in biological samples is &lt; 20x its median intensity in blank samples was removed; features with relative standard deviation (RSD) \u2265 30% across the QCs were removed; samples with &gt; 50% missing values were removed; features which were missing in \u2265 10% QCs and/or \u2265 50% of all samples were removed; features present in the list of putative xenobiotic features were removed. Univariate statistical analysis (t-test) were applied after probabilistic quotient normalisation (PQN). Principal components analysis was carried out after PQN, missing value imputation by k-nearest neighbour (k = 5) and generalised log transformation. These steps were executed using the R/Bioconductor packages pmp (v1.6.0, <a href='(https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/pmp.html' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>(https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/pmp.html</a>) and structToolbox<strong>[5]</strong> (v1.6.1, <a href='https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/structToolbox.html' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/structToolbox.html</a>).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Xenobiotic-based data analysis:</strong></p><p>Exposure to suspect xenobiotics, i.e., any of the Top 20 drugs prescribed by the UK National Heath Service (NHS) between 2014-2020, was defined for human samples with unknown exposures as follows. First, measured features corresponding to each of the 10 suspect xenobiotics were identified by (i) match of measured m/z to theoretical m/z, for a low confidence annotation (MSI Level 3 / Schymanski et al level 3), (ii) match of selected MS2 fragmentation data to MS2 spectrum contained within a public database (MassBank, GNPS), for a mid-confidence annotation (MSI Level 2 / Schymanski et al. level 2) and/or (iii), match of MS2 fragmentation pattern and retention time to that of a chemical standard measured using the same instrument and analytical method, for a high-confidence annotation (MSI Level 1 / Schymanski et al. Level 1). Using the annotated features, samples were defined as exposed to a given xenobiotic if the relative intensity of the representative feature was &gt; 10-fold the median intensity across all samples and intra-study QCs, after imputing missing values with the lowest measured relative intensity across all features. Where relative intensity was below this value, the sample was defined as \u2018control\u2019.</p><p><br></p><p>In the case of laboratory model-based experiments (in vivo rat &amp; in vitro cardiomyocyte studies), the \u2018exposed\u2019 and \u2018control\u2019 sample labels were defined as per the experimental conditions.</p><p><br></p><p>Putative xenobiotic-related features were discovered by applying the following filters: feature present in \u2265 80% (rat and cardiomyocyte datasets) or \u2265 50%, for (human dataset) of exposed samples; feature present in \u2264 50% biological control samples; and the median intensity of a feature in exposed samples is \u2265 10-fold its median intensity in biological control samples. This was implemented using the R/Bioconductor package structToolbox<strong>[5]</strong> (v1.6.0, <a href='https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/structToolbox.html' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/structToolbox.html</a>).</p><p><br></p><p>Pearson\u2019s correlation analysis was carried out using the R/cran package RcmdrMisc (<a href='https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RcmdrMisc/index.html' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RcmdrMisc/index.html</a>) on combined data from all UHPLC-MS assays following normalisation of intensity measurements by probabilistic quotient normalisation (PQN), applying coefficients calculated for the endogenous datasets. A given pair of features were defined as co-responsive when Holm adjusted p-value &lt; 0.05 and R \u2265 0.75.</p><p><br></p><p>K-means cluster analysis was carried out using the R programming language (<a href='https://www.R-project.org' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>https://www.R-project.org</a>). Prior to analysis, data was scaled by unit variance. An elbow plot was generated for each dataset to select the optimal value of k prior to execution of k means cluster analysis using the median intensity of feature across biological replicates at each time point.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Chambers MC, Maclean B, Burke R, Amodei D, Ruderman DL, Neumann S, Gatto L, Fischer B, Pratt B, Egertson J, Hoff K, Kessner D, Tasman N, Shulman N, Frewen B, Baker TA, Brusniak MY, Paulse C, Creasy D, Flashner L, Kani K, Moulding C, Seymour SL, Nuwaysir LM, Lefebvre B, Kuhlmann F, Roark J, Rainer P, Detlev S, Hemenway T, Huhmer A, Langridge J, Connolly B, Chadick T, Holly K, Eckels J, Deutsch EW, Moritz RL, Katz JE, Agus DB, MacCoss M, Tabb DL, Mallick P.
