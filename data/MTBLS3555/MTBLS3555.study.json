                "description": "The ability to obtain purified biliverdin IX (BVIX) isomers other than the commercially available BVIX\u03b1 is limited due to the low yields obtained by the chemical coupled oxidation of heme. Chemical oxidation requires toxic chemicals, has very poor BVIX yields (<0.05%), and is not conducive to scalable production. Alternative approaches utilizing recombinant E. coli BL21 expressing a cyanobacterial heme oxygenase have been employed for the production BVIX\u03b1, but yields are limited by the rate of endogenous heme biosynthesis. Furthermore, the emerging roles of BVIX\u03b2 and BVIX\u03b4 in biology and their lack of commercial availability has led to a need for an efficient and scalable method with the flexibility to produce all three physiologically relevant BVIX isomers. Herein, we have taken advantage of an optimized non-pathogenic E. coli Nissle (EcN(T7)) strain that encodes an endogenous heme transporter and an integrated T7 polymerase gene. Protein production of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa BVIX\u03b2 and BVIX\u03b4 selective heme oxygenase (HemO) or its BVIX\u03b1 producing mutant (HemOa) in the EcN(T7) strain provides a scalable method to obtain all three isomers, that is not limited by the rate of endogenous heme biosynthesis, due to the natural ability of EcN(T7) to transport extracellular heme. Additionally, we have optimized our previous LC-MS/MS protocol for semi-preparative separation and validation of the BVIX isomers. Utilizing this new methodology for scalable production and separation we have increased the yields of the BVIX\u03b2 and -\u03b4 isomers >300-fold when compared to the chemical oxidation of heme.",

Precautions to avoid contaminants within the BVIX  isomer extraction and HPLC separation were taken using HPLC grade reagents and solvents (Fisher Optima). Similar precautions for LC-MS/MS BVIX isomer validation using LC-MS grade (Fisher Optima and ThermoScientific for DMSO) reagents and solvents. Specific medias, columns, and instruments are listed below where appropriate.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>BVIX isomer production via HemO over-expression in EcN(T7)</strong></p><p>Electrocompetent EcN(T7) cells were prepared as previously described in a paper<strong>[1]</strong> with some modifications. Briefly, 5 mL LB (Lennox) cultures inoculated with EcN(T7) were shaken at 210 rpm overnight at 37 \u00b0C in 10 mL culture tubes. The overnight culture was diluted into fresh 25 mL LB cultures in a 125 ml flask to a final OD600 = 0.05 and grown with shaking (210 rpm) at 37 \u00b0C until the OD600 reached 0.5-0.6 (mid-log phase). The culture was then centrifuged at 5,000 x g at 4 \u00b0C for 5 min and pellets were washed with 25 mL chilled 10% glycerol and the wash repeated twice more. Following the washing steps the culture was recentrifuged and suspended in 250 mL of 10% glycerol to a final 100x lower volume from the initial culture. 30 mL aliquots of the&nbsp;final cell volume (250 mL) were used for electroporation or stored at -80 \u00b0C for up to 3 mth. Electroporation was performed as previously described in a paper<strong>[2]</strong> with slight modifications. Briefly, 1-5 mL of pEThemO or pEThemOa (Ratliff et al., 2001;Heinzl et al., 2016;Liang et al., 2018;Robinson et al., 2021), was electroporated into electrocompetent EcN(T7) cells using prechilled 2mm gap electroporation cuvettes and a BioRad Micropulser Electroporator on the \u201cBacteria: Ec1\u201d setting (1.8kV, 1 pulse). 1 mL SOC media at 25 \u00b0C was immediately added to the electroporated culture, transferred to an ice-cold culture tube, and set to shake at 210 rpm for at least 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. 250 mL of electroporated cells were then plated onto LB agar containing a final concentration of 100 mg/mL ampicillin and incubated overnight at 37 \u00b0C. The resulting colonies were inoculated into 25 mL LB media containing100 mg/mL ampicillin and shaken at 250 rpm overnight at 37 \u00b0C. HemO overexpression was performed as previously described in the papers<strong>[3]-[5]</strong> with slight modification to increase aeration and optimize HemO expression. Briefly, an overnight culture was diluted into fresh 100 mL of LB media containing 100 mg/mL ampicillin in 250 mL baffled flasks and shaken at 250 rpm for 1.5-2 hr at 37 \u00b0C or until they reached an OD600 = 0.4-0.5. Cultures were induced with 1 mM IPTG and shaken at 250 rpm for a further 2 h at 25 \u00b0C. The cultures were then supplemented with appropriate concentrations of heme (10 mM, 15 mM, 20 mM, and 25 mM) prepared in DMSO (10-100 mL)&nbsp;and shaken at 250 rpm overnight at 25 \u00b0C. Cultures were pelleted (5,000 x g, 20 mins, 4 \u00b0C) in 50 mL conical tubes, and the supernatants were collected for BVIX extraction or stored at -80 \u00b0C for up to 1 month. Pellets were thawed, resuspended in Milli Q water and 2 mg/mL DNase I, sonicated at 100% amplification for 5 s on and 15 s off for 2 min, and run on a 12% SDS PAGE gel at 200 V for 30 mis as previously described with slight modifications<strong>[4]-[6]</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1] </strong>Dower WJ, Miller JF, Ragsdale CW.

Briefly, supernatants were filtered through a 0.2 mm PVDF membrane to remove any remaining particulate matter. In the dark, supernatants were acidified to pH 2.5 with 10% TFA, and loaded over a C18 Sep-Pak column (35cc, Waters) equilibrated with 20 mL each of acetonitrile (ACN), H2O, 0.1% TFA in H2O, and methanol:0.1% TFA (10:90).&nbsp;After sample application, the column was washed with 40 mL 0.1% TFA, 40 mL ACN:0.1% TFA (20:80), 20 mL methanol:0.1% TFA (50:50) and eluted with 15 mL methanol. Alternatively, for smaller batches the isomers were purified over a 3cc (Waters) C18 Sep-Pak column equilibrated as above scaling back the washes and elution volumes x10. The supernatant was centrifuged (14,800 rpm, 5 min, 25 \u00b0C) and the remaining solution containing purified BVIX isomers was collected. Purified BVIX isomers were diluted with an equal volume of water and extracted into CHCl3 (3-5 mL) washed with x3 with 5 mL H2O to remove any remaining acid. The CHCl3 layer was collected, and speed vacuumed dry and stored at -80 \u00b0C prior to HPLC separation.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>HPLC separation of BVIX isomers</strong></p><p>Dried BVIX aliquots were resuspended in 100 mL HPLC-grade methanol and centrifuged (14,800 rpm, 5 minutes, 25 \u00b0C) to remove any particulates. The BVIX isomers were then separated by HPLC (ThermoFisher Ultimate 3000 HPLC) on an Synergi 4 \u00b5m Fusion-RP 80 \u00c5 C18 Column (250 x 10 mm) at a flow rate of 3 mL/min. The mobile phase consisted of solvent A, H2O:0.1% formic acid, and solvent B, ACN:0.1% formic acid. A linear gradient was run starting at 64% A and 36% B and ending with 0% A and 100% B over 20 or 30 mins. BVIX isomer retention times were 9.9 min, 10.8 min, and 11.6 min for BVIXa, BVIXd, and BVIXb isomers, respectively, for the 20 min linear gradient and 9.7 min, 12.1 min, and 13 min, respectively for the 30 min linear gradient. Separated isomers were then extracted into choloroform as described above, speed vacuumed dry and stored at -80 \u00b0C. The final yield of each BVIX isomer was calculated from their respective millimolar extinction coefficients (emM) at 376 nm and 665 nm in methanol as previously described<strong>[2]</strong>. BVIXa, -b, and -d millimolar extinction coefficients at 376 nm are 50.6, 51.7, and 47.1 mM-1 cm-1, respectively, and at 665nm are 14.6, 15.4, and 15.5 mM-1 cm-1, respectively.
