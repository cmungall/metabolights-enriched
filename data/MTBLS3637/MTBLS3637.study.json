                "description": "<p>The potential of the gut microbiome as a driver of individual cognitive differences in natural populations of animals remains unexplored. Here, using metagenomic sequencing of individual bumblebee hindguts, we find a positive correlation between the abundance of <em>Lactobacillus</em> Firm-5 cluster and memory retention on a visual discrimination task. Supplementation with the Firm-5 species <em>Lactobacillus apis </em>(<em>L. apis</em>), but not other non-Firm-5 bacterial species, enhances bees\u2019 memory. Untargeted metabolomics after <em>L. apis</em> supplementation show increased LPA (14:0) glycerophospholipid in the haemolymph. Oral administration of the LPA increases long-term memory significantly. Based on our findings and metagenomic/metabolomic analyses, we propose a molecular pathway for this gut-brain interaction. Our results provide insights into proximate and ultimate causes of cognitive differences in natural bumblebee populations.</p>",

All colonies were settled in wooden nest boxes (40 x 28 x 11 cm), which were connected to small flight arenas (65 x 45 x 25 cm) through a perspex corridor (25 x 3.5 x 3.5 cm). There were small doors in the corridor which allowed us to control when and which bees were able to enter the arena. Bee identity was tracked with individual number tags (Opalithpl\u00e4ttchen, Warnholz &amp; Bienenvoigt, Ellerau, Germany) glued to the top of the bee thorax by means of Superglue. Illumination in the lab was controlled with a 12 h day/night cycle (8:00 AM/8:00 PM). Bees had no foraging experience in the arena prior to pretraining.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Diet supplementation with <em>Lactobacillus apis</em> </strong></p><p><strong><em>Lactobacillus apis</em></strong> (<strong><em>L. apis</em></strong>) was isolated from the hindguts of bumblebees using MRS agar (<em>Lactobacillus apis</em> BB1). <em>L. apis</em> BB1 was grown in MRS broth at 37 \u00b0C under anaerobic conditions. After 2 days, bacteria cultures were centrifuged at 8000 x g for 1 min, washed 3 times with sterile PBS and diluted in 40% sucrose solution to OD600 = 1.0. Bees that were 3 days old (from emergence) were moved into small wooden boxes and provided with adequate pollen and fresh sucrose solution (with or without <em>L. apis</em>), which was made daily and supplied to different treatment groups of bees between 15:00-16:00 PM for 9 days. For bee collection, bees were anesthetized with CO2 by holding them above dry ice for several seconds. The hindgut was dissected out and the haemolymph was collected from an incision at the base of the head of each bee immediately after sample collection.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Metabolomic analysis of the hindgut, haemolymph and brain samples</strong></p><p>A total of 147 bees from 2 colonies were used for the untargeted metabolomic analysis. For each group, bees were collected from both colonies evenly. The <em>L. apis</em> supplementation group consisted of 35 bees from colony 1 and 40 bees from colony 2. The control group consisted of 37 bees from colony 1 and 35 bees from colony 2. The hindguts, haemolymph or brains from 11 to 14 bees (the same colony) were pooled in each sample and there were 6 biological replicates for each group.</p>",
