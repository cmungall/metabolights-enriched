                "description": "Altered metabolism is increasingly acknowledged as an important aspect of cancer, and thus serves as a potentially fertile area for the identification of therapeutic targets or leads. Our recent work using transcriptional data to predict metabolite levels in cancer cells led to preliminary evidence of the antiproliferative role of menaquinone (vitamin K2) in the Jurkat cell line model of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. However, nothing is known about the direct metabolic impacts of menaquinone in cancer, which could provide insights into its mechanism of action. Here, we used metabolomics to investigate the process by which menaquinone exerts antiproliferative activity on Jurkat cells. We first validated the dose-dependent, semi-selective, pro-apoptotic activity of menaquinone treatment on Jurkat cells relative to non-cancerous lymphoblasts. We then used mass spectrometry-based metabolomics to identify systems-scale changes in metabolic dynamics that are distinct from changes induced in noncancerous cells or by other chemotherapeutics. One of the most significantly affected metabolites was phosphoethanolamine, which exhibited a two-fold increase in menaquinone-treated Jurkat cells compared to vehicle-treated cells at 24 h, growing to a five-fold increase at 72 h. Phosphoethanolamine elevation was observed prior to the induction of apoptosis, and was not observed in menaquinonetreated lymphoblasts or chemotherapeutic-treated Jurkat cells. We also validated the link between menaquinone and phosphoethanolamine in an ovarian cancer cell line, suggesting potentially broad applicability of their relationship. This metabolomics-based work is the first detailed characterization of the metabolic impacts of menaquinone treatment and the first identified link between phosphoethanolamine and menaquinone-induced apoptosis.",

Helium was used as the carrier gas with a corrected constant flow rate of 1.00 ml/min. The inlet septum purge flow was maintained at 3 ml/min. The inlet was functioning in splitless mode with a purge flow of 100 ml/min delayed to start 30 seconds after injection, giving a total flow of 101 ml/min. Runs were performed in a gas saver mode with a flow of 20 ml/min set to start a minute after injection. Front inlet temperature was set at 250 \u00b0C for the entire run.  The primary oven temperature was held at 70 \u00b0C for 1 min and the temperature was ramped at 10 \u00b0C/min until 315 \u00b0C and held for 2 min. The secondary oven temperature and the modulator temperature offsets were 5 \u00b0C and 20 \u00b0C above the main oven respectively. One minute equilibration time was set for the ovens. The transfer line temperature was maintained at 320 \u00b0C for the entire run. From start to 450 s, a modulation period of 5 s was programmed with 1.00 s hot pulse and 1.50 s cool time. Modulation period was 6 s from 450 to 756 with 1.50 s each hot pulse and cool time. Modulation was reduced back to 5 s from 756 till the end of run with the hot and cold pulse of 1.50 s and 1.00 s respectively.",

                        "description": "Date output from instrument was first analyzed with ChromaTOF (LECO, St. Joseph, MI) to determine baseline, peak area, and peak identities. Software settings included a baseline offset of 0.5, automatic smoothing, 1st dimension peak width of 24 s, 2nd dimension peak width of 0.25 s, and a match of 700 was required to combine peaks with a minimum signal-to-noise (S/N) of 10 for all subpeaks. Peaks were required to have a S/N of 100 and a minimum similarity score of 800 before assigning a name. Unique mass was used for peak area calculation.\n</p>\nTo align the samples, MetPP (http://metaopen.sourceforge.net/metpp.html) was used, along with the extraction blank file used for peak deduction. Unknowns were retained during peak alignment. On-the-fly alignment was used with quality control samples manually selected as the peak list for primary alignment. Peak alignment was performed using the default criteria.\n</p>\nAfter alignment, further processing of the data was done to remove any batch effects from the data set using LOESS. To remove analytes that were not reproducibly detected, analytes for which more than half of the values were missing in the QC samples or for which the QC samples had a coefficient of variance larger than 0.5 were removed from the data set. Then, missing values were manually corrected using small value correction only if more than half of the values in biological replicates were missing. (However, we note that for the OVCAR-3 validation experiments, since only one metabolite was being tested and there were very few samples, direct results from ChromaTOF were used because the downstream analysis steps were either unnecessary or inappropriate.)\n</p>\nAnnotated analytes were then compared to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and the Human Metabolome Database (HMDB); if they were listed in KEGG and HMDB they were considered annotated as metabolites. The metabolites were then verified by a manual confirmation of similarity between the annotated peak spectrum and the library spectrum.",
