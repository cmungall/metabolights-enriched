                "description": "<p>The gut microbiota is essential to host health. Probiotics can be used as a microbiota targeted therapy to improve host health. However, probiotic molecular mechanisms of action and probiotics targeting the small intestinal microbiota are often not elucidated. In this study, we construct a three species synthetic community resembling the upper small intestine. We show that probiotic supplementation results in direct colonization resistance by affecting the metabolism of the community in a probiotic specific manner. Supplementation with Streptococcus thermophilus increased lactate production and reduced the pH, but did not affect the overall metabolic network substantially. In contrast, Lactobacillus casei did not alter lactate production or the pH, but increased the resistance to perturbations and nutrient utilization. Furthermore, supplementation of L. casei together with kynurenine increased metabolism along the kynurenine pathway and resulted in an elevated concentration of kynurenic acid, possibly leading to indirect colonization resistance. Together, we show how network construction can be used to improve the current or identify novel microbiota-targeted therapies.</p>",

The temperature of the samples was controlled at 25&nbsp;\u00b0C during measurement. Prior to data acquisition, tuning and matching of the probe head followed by shimming and proton pulse calibration were performed automatically for each sample. One-dimensional (1D)&nbsp;1H-NMR spectra were recorded using the first increment of a NOESY pulse sequence with presaturation (\u03b3B1&nbsp;=&nbsp;50&nbsp;Hz) for water suppression during a relaxation delay of 4&nbsp;s and a mixing time of 10&nbsp;ms. 256 scans of 65,536 points covering 13,658&nbsp;Hz were recorded and zero filled to 65,536 complex points prior to Fourier transformation, an exponential window function was applied with a line-broadening factor of 1.0&nbsp;Hz. The spectra were phase and baseline corrected and referenced to the internal standard (TSP;&nbsp;\u03b4&nbsp;0.0&nbsp;ppm), using the MestReNova software (v.12.0.0-20080, Mesterlab Research). With the same software, spectral alignment was performed selecting manually areas and applying a linear filling method of the missing values, after the exclusion of the water signal and the surrounding empty area (4.50-5.30&nbsp;ppm). Spectral binning followed from -0.50 to 9.00 ppm with an equal size binning step of 0.005 ppm. Noise removal was performed by averaging each integrated bin separately and removing the bins with an average below 100. Before ordination analysis bins belonging to TSP (-0.50-0.72 ppm), ethanol (1.170-1.220 ppm and 3.640-3.690 ppm) and a pH sensitive area (7.850-8.190 ppm) were removed. The annotation of the bins was performed with the Chenomx Profiler software (Chenomx NMR Suite 8.6 and Chenomx 600&nbsp;MHz, version 11) and the HMDB database 5.0 (http://www.hmdb.ca).</p>",
