                "description": "Introduction:</br>Raspberries are becoming increasingly popular due to their reported health beneficial properties. Despite the presence of only trace amounts of anthocyanins yellow varieties seems to show similar or better effects in comparison to conventional raspberries.</br>Objectives:</br>The aim of this work is to characterize the metabolic differences between red and yellow berries, focussing on the compounds showing a higher concentration in yellow varieties.</br>Methods:</br>The metabolomic profile of 13 red and 12 yellow raspberries (of different varieties, locations and collection dates) was determined by UPLC-TOF-MS and a novel correlation based approach was implemented to extract the pseudospectra of the most relevant biomarkers from high energy LC-MS runs.</br>Results:</br>Among the metabolites showing higher concentration in yellow raspberries it was possible to identify a series of compounds showing a pseudospectrum similar to that of A-type procyanidin polymers. The annotation of this group of compounds was confirmed by specific MS/MS experiments and performing standard injections.</br>Conclusion:</br>In berries lacking anthocyanins the polyphenol metabolism might be shifted to the formation of a novel class of A-type procyanidin polymers.",

For each sample and QC, the extraction was made as follows: 11.5 to 12.5 g of frozen raspberry was weighed in plastic 50 ml tubes, followed by addition of 150 mg internal standard (3,5-hidroxybenzoic acid) and 10 ml of 70% acetone to each tube. Samples were homogeneized with an IKA Ultraturrax disperser (Staufen, Germany) at a speed of 18 for 1.5 min. 10 ml of 70% acetone was used to help wash and collect all the sample from the homogenizer. The sample was allowed to extract for 20 min, after which it was centrifuged for 5 min at 5000 rcf. The supernatant was collected into a 100 ml round bottom flask, filtering through glass wool to help collect any solid residues. Further 20 ml of 70% acetone was added to the pellet, vortexed vigorously to help homogeneization and centrifuged as before. The second (clear) supernatant was combined with the first one. After washing the funnel and glass wool with 5 ml of 70% acetone, the acetone was removed by rotary evaporation at 40 \u00b0C. The concentrated extract was transfered to a 20 ml volumetric flask and brought to volume with 5% methanol. 480 \u00b5l of each extract was transfered to an eppendorf containing 20 \u00b5l of 4-hidroxystilbene (5.6 g/l), filtered through 0.2 \u00b5M PTFE filters into 2 ml amber (LC-MS certificated) vials, and stored at 4 \u00baC until the time of analysis.
