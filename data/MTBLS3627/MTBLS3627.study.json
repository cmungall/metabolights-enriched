                "description": "<p>Patterns in functional diversity of organisms at large spatial scales can provide insight into possible responses to future climate change, but it remains a challenge to link large-scale patterns at the organismal level to their underlying physiological mechanisms. The climate variability hypothesis predicts that temperate ectotherms will be less vulnerable to climate warming than tropical ectotherms, due to their superior acclimatization capacity. However, metabolic acclimatization occurs over multiple levels of the biological hierarchy, from the enzyme and cellular level, through organ systems, to whole-organism metabolic rate. Previous studies have focused on one or a few biological hierarchy levels, leaving us without a general understanding of how metabolic acclimatization might differ between tropical and temperate species. Here, we investigate thermal acclimatization of 3 species of <em>Takydromus</em> lizards distributed along a broad latitudinal gradient in China, by studying metabolic modifications at the level of the whole organism, organ, mitochondria, metabolome and proteome. As predicted by the climate variability hypothesis, the 2 temperate species <em>T. septentrionalis</em> and <em>T. wolteri</em> had an enhanced acclimation response at the whole organism level compared to the tropical species <em>T. sexlineatus</em>, as measured by respiratory gas exchange rates. However, the mechanisms by which whole organism performance was modified was strikingly different in the 2 temperate species: widespread <em>T. septentrionalis</em> modified organ sizes, while the narrowly distributed <em>T. wolteri</em> relied on mitochondrial, proteomic and metabolomic regulation. We suggest that these 2 mechanisms of thermal acclimatization may represent general strategies used by ectotherms, with distinct ecological costs and benefits. Lacking either of these mechanisms of thermal acclimatization capacity, the tropical species is likely to have increased vulnerability to climate change.</p>",
