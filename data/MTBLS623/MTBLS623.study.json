                "description": "The quality of milk metabolome analyzed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is greatly influenced by the way samples are prepared. Although this analytical method is increasingly used to study milk metabolites, a thorough examination of available sample preparation protocols for milk has not been reported yet. We evaluated the performance of eight milk preparation methods namely (1) raw milk without any processing; (2) skimmed milk; (3) ultrafiltered milk; (4) skimming followed by ultrafiltration; (5) ultracentrifuged milk; (6) methanol; (7) dichloromethane; and (8) methanol/dichloromethane, in terms of spectra quality, repeatability, signal-to-noise ratio, extraction efficiency and yield criteria. A pooled sample of milk was used for all protocols. Skimming, ultracentrifugation and unprocessed milk protocols showed poor NMR spectra quality. Protocols involving multiple steps, namely methanol/dichloromethane extraction, and skimming followed by ultrafiltration produced inadequate results for signal-to-noise ratio parameter. Methanol and skimming associated to ultrafiltration provided good repeatability results compared to the other protocols. Chemical-based sample preparation protocols, particularly methanol, showed more efficient metabolite extraction compared to physical preparation methods. When considering all evaluation parameters, the methanol extraction protocol proved to be the best method. As a proof of utility, methanol protocol was then applied to milk samples from dairy cows fed a diet with or without a feed additive, showing a clear separation between the two groups of cows.",

                        "description": "Protocols were evaluated by analyzing replicate sets (n = 6) of quality control samples (QC) prepared from a pooled milk sample that were collected (10 ml from each cow) from 4 lactating Holstein cows (54 \u00b1 14 days in milk) receiving a diet consisting of 56% corn silage, 4% hay and 40% of concentrate. Milk samples were collected at each milking, twice in a single day aliquoted by fraction of 500 \u03bcl and immediately stored at -80 \u00b0C. Samples were thawed on ice and mixed for each individual cow at a 3:2 ratio for the morning and evening milking, respectively. In this study, 8 different sample preparation protocols described in the literature were evaluated: 1) raw milk without any processing[1]; 2) skimmed milk[2], 3) ultrafiltered milk[3][4], 4) skimming followed by ultrafiltration[5], 5) ultracentrifuged milk[6]; 6) methanol[7], 7) dichloromethane[8] and 8) methanol/dichloromethane[9][10]. Protocols 2) to 5) are physical separation protocols using centrifugation and/or filtration whereas protocols 6) to 8) are based on chemical sample preparation. Samples were thawed on ice, homogenized by vortex mixing and processed following each specific procedure. To minimize changes in the metabolome during sample preparation, samples were kept on ice or at 4 \u00b0C whenever possible and each protocol was performed as quickly as possible, i.e. no waiting time between steps.<br><br>The chosen protocol was finally tested using samples from an independent study to validate the methodology. For that, we used milk samples obtained from individual cows from a study described previously[11]. In this study, lactating cows were allocated into 2 groups that were fed a similar diet consisting of 54% maize silage, 6% of hay, and 40% of concentrate supplemented (Treated, n = 8) or not (Control, n = 8) with 3.5% fat from linseed and 1.8% nitrate. Linseed and nitrate are known to reduce methane emission without affecting digestibility and animal health[12]. Both groups were balanced for calving date, milk production and had similar proportion of crude protein, starch, and fiber content in the diet. All these factors are known to influence milk composition and milk metabolome[13]. We choose this study because we hypothesized that differences in milk metabolome between the 2 groups would not be large and to be able to detect these differences using a relatively reduced number of individuals the analytical variance accounted for the sample preparation protocol needs to be low. Milk samples were collected in week 16 of the study, stored at \u201380 \u00b0C and processed as described above.<br><br>Ref:<br>[1] Hu F, Furihata K, Kato Y, Tanokura M.

                        "description": "For physical separation protocols, skimmed milk samples were prepared by centrifugation of 500 \u03bcl of milk at 1,000 x g for 15 min. The aqueous layer was aspirated and transferred into 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes for a second centrifugation step using the same parameters. Ultrafiltration was undertaken with Amicon centrifugal filter units (cut-off 10 kDa) (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) as described previously[1]. Filters were prewashed as described previously[2]. A double wash was necessary to remove contaminants and protective agents released by the filter. A preliminary test was performed on protocols using ultrafiltration to determine the minimum milk dilution that gave the largest volume of filtered milk. Different volumes of water (50-100-150-250 and 300 \u03bcl) were added into 500 \u03bcl milk, vortex mixed and centrifuged at 14,000 x g for 20 min at 4 \u00b0C. Adding a volume of 50 \u03bcl of water was optimal for ultrafiltration protocol but none of the tested volumes changed the volume recovered from the protocol combining skimming and ultrafiltration, as the skimming steps discarded a great amount of high molecular weight compounds. Ultracentrifugation was performed at 140,000 x g for 75 min at 4 \u00b0C (Beckman L8-55M, Brea, USA). The lower layer was collected in glass tubes, centrifuged at 16,000 x g for 20 min at ambient temperature (20 \u00b0C) to remove remaining fat and the supernatant was used for analysis. For each physical separation protocol, the final volume collected was measured and adjusted to 500 \u03bcl with Milli-Q water.<br><br>For chemical based preparation protocols, 500 \u03bcl of milk samples were transferred into Pyrex glass tubes to avoid any interaction between the solvent and the container. For the methanol protocol as described previously[3], 1 ml of cold methanol was added to the milk sample. The mixture was vortexed, stored at -20 \u00b0C for 30 min and centrifuged at 18,000 x g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C. The methanol-water solution was then transferred to a glass tube using a Pasteur pipette and evaporated to dryness using a Speedvac evaporator (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, USA) without heating for 3 hr. The residue was dissolved in 500 \u03bcl of Milli-Q water for the analysis of polar compounds. The dichloromethane protocol was described previously[4]. Briefly 1 ml dichloromethane was mixed with 500 \u03bcl of milk, vortexed for 20 s, and centrifuged at 8,000 x g for 20 min at room temperature (20 \u00b0C). The milk aqueous layer was collected, the volume was adjusted to 500 \u03bcl and analyzed without any other processing. The methanol/dichloromethane protocol[5][6] involved the use of 6 ml of methanol/dichloromethane mixture (1:2, v: v). Samples were homogenized with a vortex mixer for 10 s and centrifuged at 1,500 x g for 5 min at 4 \u00b0C. The supernatant was collected (2.3 ml), mixed with 1.2 ml of NaCl (0.9%), and centrifuged as described in the first step. The top aqueous layer was collected, evaporated to dryness as described above for the methanol protocol and the residue was dissolved in 500 \u03bcl of Milli-Q water for the analysis of polar compounds.<br><br>Metabolite quantification and recovery were tested on protocols that passed the first NMR spectra quality step. Samples were spiked at 0.12 M with a standard mixture containing hippurate, 3-hydroxybutyrate, alanine, citrate, and formate. These 5 metabolites were chosen as they are naturally present in milk and they display chemical shifts covering a broad spectrum range (from 1.47 to 8.46 ppm). For each protocol, 3 replicates were spiked with the standard mixture and 3 without as follows: to 250 \u03bcl of QC sample, 50 \u03bcl of standard mixture or 50 \u03bcl of Milli-Q water were added. After the different sample preparations, Milli-Q water was added if necessary to obtain a final volume of 500 \u03bcl. Control samples were also prepared, using 50 \u03bcl of the standard mixture and 450 \u03bcl of Milli-Q water.<br><br>Ref:<br>[1] Sundekilde UK, Poulsen NA, Larsen LB, Bertram HC.

Spectra were acquired using a Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) spin echo sequence used to reduce macromolecular signals[1] with a 5 s-relaxation delay to attenuate proteins and lipoproteins broad signals. A water suppression signal was achieved, by presaturation during the relaxation delay. The spectral width was set to 20 ppm for each spectrum and 128 scans (16 dummy scans) were collected with 32K points. Free induction decays were multiplied by an exponential window function (LB = 0.3 Hertz used to avoid broad signals) before Fourier Transform. The spectra were manually phased and the baseline was corrected. All spectra were referenced to TSP signal at 0 ppm. A zgpr 1D pulse sequence was used for quantitative NMR. A relaxation delay of 8 s was used, the receiver gain (rg) was set to 36, and 512 scans were collected with 32K points. The line broadening was set at 0.3.<br><br>Ref:<br>[1] Gowda GA, Zhang S, Gu H, Asiago V, Shanaiah N, Raftery D. Metabolomics-based methods for early disease diagnostics.

A variable size bucketing was used based on graphical pattern (166 buckets), each integrated region was normalized to the TSP signal. Data were analyzed by chemometrics tools as unsupervised principle component analysis (PCA) and supervised orthogonal projections to latent structures-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA)[1] using SIMCA P+ (V14, Umetrics AB, Umea, Sweden). PCA was first performed to look for trends, clusters between protocols or identify potential outliers. For the samples used for validation, based on both Hotelling and the distance to the model (DModx) plots, 2 samples from the treated group were outliers and then removed. These 2 samples had altered spectra with an important methanol signal, probably caused by incomplete evaporation of methanol. Supervised OPLS-DA was performed on validation samples to reveal potential markers of response to additive supplementation. The performances of the models were assessed by their predictive ability (Q2) and the proportion of explained variable (R2). A cross-validation procedure was used to assess the robustness of the model using the permutation test proposed by SIMCA P+ (V14, Umetrics AB, Umea, Sweden). Most predicted values (Q2) obtained by the permutation test were equal or lower than those of the original model indicating its validity (see Fig. 5B of the paper associated with this study).<br><br>Ref:<br>[1] Trygg J and Wold S.

We further followed the annotation by comparing our data with published studies[1]-[4] and on standards implemented in databases like the Human Metabolome Database[5] (<a href='http://www.hmdb.ca/metabolites'>http://www.hmdb.ca/metabolites</a>) and the Biological Magnetic Resonance Data Bank[6] (<a href='http://www.bmrb.wisc.edu/metabolomics/metabolomicsstandards.shtml'>http://www.bmrb.wisc.edu/metabolomics/metabolomicsstandards.shtml</a>). Identified chemical structures were confirmed using two-dimensional NMR experiments (2D J-Resolved 1H NMR spectroscopy, 2D 1H-1H Correlation Spectroscopy, 2D 1H-13C Heteronuclear Single Quantum Spectroscopy). As described previously[7], metabolites are identified at the Metabolomics Standards Initiative (MSI) level 1 if 2 independent and orthogonal data are identical to those of a reference compound analyzed under the same conditions (for example 1H NMR spectrum and 2D 1H-13C HSQC NMR spectra). If this information is not available the metabolite is putatively annotated from publications or databases (MSI level 2). The identification MSI level is given for each metabolite.<br><br>Ref:<br>[1] Sundekilde UK, Poulsen NA, Larsen LB, Bertram HC.
