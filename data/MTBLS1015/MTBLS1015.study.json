                "description": "<p><strong>AIMS: </strong>Previous metabolomics studies suggest that type 1 diabetes is preceded by specific metabolic disturbances. The aim of this study was to investigate whether distinct metabolic patterns occur in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of children who later develop pancreatic beta cell autoimmunity or overt type 1 diabetes.</p><p><strong>METHODS:</strong> In a longitudinal cohort setting, PBMC metabolomic analysis was applied in children who (1) progressed to type 1 diabetes (PT1D, n\u2009=\u200934), (2) seroconverted to \u22651 islet autoantibody without progressing to type 1 diabetes (P1Ab, n\u2009=\u200927) or (3) remained autoantibody negative during follow-up (CTRL, n\u2009=\u200910).</p><p><strong>RESULTS:</strong> During the first year of life, levels of most lipids and polar metabolites were lower in the PT1D and P1Ab groups compared with the CTRL group. Pathway over-representation analysis suggested alanine, aspartate, glutamate, glycerophospholipid and sphingolipid metabolism were over-represented in PT1D. Genome-scale metabolic models of PBMCs during type 1 diabetes progression were developed by using publicly available transcriptomics data and constrained with metabolomics data from our study. Metabolic modelling confirmed altered ceramide pathways, known to play an important role in immune regulation, as specifically associated with type 1 diabetes progression.</p><p><strong>CONCLUSIONS:</strong> Our data suggest that systemic dysregulation of lipid metabolism, as observed in plasma, may impact the metabolism and function of immune cells during progression to overt type 1 diabetes.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Links: </strong></p><p>The GEMs for PBMCs have been submitted to <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/MODEL1905270001' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>BioModels</a>, under accession number MODEL1905270001.</p>",

Accurate mass spectra in the MS scan were acquired in the m/z range 100\u20131700 in positive ion mode, and in range 100-1700 in the negative mode for the MS/MS runs.

The injector system was washed with 10% DCM in MeOH and ACN:MeOH:IPA:H2O (1:1:1:1, v/v/v/v) + 0.1% HCOOH as needle wash solutions after each injection for 7.5 sec each.</p><p class='ql-align-justify'><br></p><p class='ql-align-justify'><strong>Polar Metabolomics (GCMS)</strong></p><p class='ql-align-justify'>The derivatized samples were analyzed using gas chromatography (Agilent 7890B) coupled to a single quad mass spectrometer (5977B). The ion source was set to electron ionization mode and held at 230 \u00b0C and the quadrupole at 150 \u00b0C. Due to the large number of analytes quantified, the samples were injected twice. The first run quantified the amino acids and the second run quantified all other components.

MS/MS data were acquired in both negative and positive ion modes in order to maximize identification coverage. The confirmation of a lipid\u2019s structure requires the identification of hydrocarbon chains bound to its polar moieties, and this was possible in some cases. This identification was carried out in pooled cell extracts, and with this information, an in-house database was created with m/z and retention time for each lipid. This in-house database was used for processing data by MZmine 2. Glycoceramides were identified based on their accurate mass, MS/MS analysis and retention times. Further verification of majority of the ceramides was possible with authentic standards.</p><p class='ql-align-justify'><br></p><p class='ql-align-justify'>A (semi) quantitation was performed using lipid-class-specific calibration curves (c= 100-5000 ng/ml, with ISTD mixture at c=1250 ng/ml). The calibration standards were as follows:&nbsp;&nbsp;N-oleoyl-D-erythro-sphingosine (Cer d18:1/18:1(9Z))), 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PC(16:0/16:0)), 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PC(18:0/18:0)), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PC(16:0/18:1)), 1-stearoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (LPC(18:0)), 1-oleoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (LPC(18:1)), cholest-5-en-3b-yl (9Z-octadecenoate) (CE(18:1)), cholest-5-en-3\u03b2-yl (9Z,12Z-octadecadienoate) (CE(18:2)), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (PE(16:0/18:1)), 1,2,3-trihexadecanoyl-sn-glycerol TG(16:0/16:0/16:0), 1,2,3-trioctadecanoyl-sn-glycerol TG(18:0/18:0/18:0) and N-(9Z-octadecenoyl)-sphing-4-enine-1-phosphocholine&nbsp;(SM(d18:1/18:1(9Z))).
