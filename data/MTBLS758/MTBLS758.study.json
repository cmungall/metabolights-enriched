                "description": "<p>Phaeocystis pouchetii (Hariot) Lagerheim, 1893 regularly dominates phytoplankton blooms in the Arctic. Through zooplankton grazing and microbial activity, it is considered to be a key resource for the entire marine food web but the actual relevance of biomass transfer to higher trophic levels is still under discussion. Cell physiology and algal nutritional state are suggested to be major factors controlling the observed variability in zooplankton grazing. However, no data have so far yielded insights into the metabolic state of Phaeocystis populations that would allow testing this hypothesis. Therefore, endometabolic markers of different growth phases were determined in laboratory batch cultures using comparative metabolomics and quantified in different phytoplankton blooms in the field. Metabolites, produced during exponential, early and late stationary growth of P. pouchetii were profiled using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Then, metabolites were characterized that correlate with the growth phases using multivariate statistical analysis. Free amino acids characterized exponential growth, whereas the early stationary phase was correlated with sugar alcohols, mono- and disaccharides. In the late stationary phase free fatty acids, sterols and terpenes increased. These marker metabolites were then traced in Phaeocystis blooms during a cruise in the Barents Sea and North Norwegian fjords. About 50 endometabolites of P. pouchetii were detected in natural phytoplankton communities. Their relative abundances at Phaeocystis-dominated stations differed from diatom-dominated stations. Mannitol, scyllo- inositol, 24-methylcholesta-5,22-dien-3\u03b2-ol, and several free fatty acids were characteristic for Phaeocystis-dominated blooms. Distinct metabolic profiles were detected in the nutrient- depleted community in the inner Porsangerfjord (&lt;0.5 \u03bcM NO3-, &lt;0.1 \u03bcM PO4-), with high relative amounts of free mono- and disaccharides indicative for a limited culture. This study, therefore, shows how variable physiology of phytoplankton can alter the metabolic landscape of entire plankton communities.</p>",

                        "description": "<p>Metabolite features (abbreviated as 'met.' and listed in Table S5 of the paper associated with this study) were assigned to 1 of 4 identification levels<strong>[1]</strong>: metabolites, where both retention index and mass spectrum matched a measured chemical reference standard were classified as identified (level 1). Only these metabolites are mentioned and discussed by their name. Others were ranked according to their spectral similarity to a database compound, and annotated and discussed as putative compound (level 2) or compound class (level 3), or as unidentified (level 4). Chemical reference standards were derivatized as described above. Linear retention indices were calculated, and a match between detected metabolite and reference standard was accepted with \u0394RI \u226426<strong>[2][3]</strong>. Mass spectra as extracted by AMDIS were manually compared to the following spectral databases using MS Search 2.0 g (Nist): NIST 11 library version (mainlib, replib, nist_ri), Golm Metabolome Database libraries T_MSRI_ID (http://csbdb.de/csbdb/dload/dl_msri.html; 2004) and GMD_20111121_VAR5_ALK_MSP (http://gmd.mpimp-golm.mpg.de/download/; 2011), and an in-house database (175 compounds from several metabolite classes including algal extracts of Skeletonema marinoi). Mass spectral annotations were regarded as match with a reverse match factor (R.Match) &gt;900, or tagged with '?' if the factor was 800-900 and '??' if it was 700-800.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Sumner LW, Amberg A, Barrett D, Beale MH, Beger R, Daykin CA, Fan TW, Fiehn O, Goodacre R, Griffin JL, Hankemeier T, Hardy N, Harnly J, Higashi R, Kopka J, Lane AN, Lindon JC, Marriott P, Nicholls AW, Reily MD, Thaden JJ, Viant MR.

                        "description": "<p>Phaeocystis pouchetii AJ01 (isolated 1994 from Raunefjord, Norway) was obtained from Aud Larsen (Bergen University, Norway). The strain consists solely of diploid, flagellated cells, and showed no colony formation in culture since isolation[1]. Cultures were grown in sterile-filtered, autoclaved f/2 medium (-Si) based on natural seawater at 6.7 \u00b1 0.9 \u00b0C, under a 14:10 h light:dark cycle, at 15-50 \u03bcmol photons/s/m^2 provided by fluorescent tubes (Osram L15W/840 Lumilux Cool White). Cultures were shaken once daily. To adapt cells to experimental conditions, the stock culture was transferred in three subsequent passages within the exponential growth phase into fresh medium (10% \u03bd:\u03bd). In 2 l glass bottles, 1.62 l medium (n = 4) was inoculated with 180 mL adapted culture to reach an average initial cell abundance of 4.6 \u00b1 3.3 x 10^3 cells/ml. An additional bottle with 1.8 l medium was used as medium control.</p><p><br></p><p>For endometabolite analysis, aliquots of 0.5 L were collected 2 h after onset of light from all cultures and the medium control following 12 days (exponential growth; 'exp'), 26 days (early stationary growth; 'e.stat') and 47 days (late stationary growth; 'l.stat') of culturing. Cells were filtered through GF/C filters (47 mm diameter, Whatman) at 65 kPa under pressure. Wet filters were immediately transferred to 25 ml glass beakers. A single filter was required to pass the entire culture volume from exponential cultures ('exp'), whereas 2 or 3 filters were required to pass the culture volume from early ('e.stat') and late ('l.stat') stationary cultures, respectively. After filtration, cells were immediately re-suspended in 1 ml extraction mix (methanol:ethanol:chloroform, 1:3:1, v: v: v) and, if multiple filters were used, combined in 4 ml glass vials. The time between filtration and metabolite quenching in extraction mix was on average 20 min. As internal standard (IS), 5 \u03bcl ('l.stat': 10 \u03bcl) aqueous ribitol (4 mM; &gt;99%, Sigma-Aldrich) was added. Samples were kept at -20 \u00b0C until analysis 1 month after the end of the experiment.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Jacobsen A and Veldhuis MJW.
