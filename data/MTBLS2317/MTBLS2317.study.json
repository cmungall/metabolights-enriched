                "description": "The plant wound-response is a complex process that generates physiological modi\ufb01cations for protecting the wounded tissue. In this study, tandem mass tag (TMT)-based quantitative proteomic analysis was performed to clarify the comprehensive molecular mechanism for the wound-response of broccoli subjected to two wounding intensities (0.04 and 1.85 m2 kg\u22121 for florets and shreds, respectively). Furthermore, integrated proteomic and metabolomic analysis was performed to reveal the interaction among the critical metabolic pathway responses to wounding. The results show that a total of 399 proteins and 266 proteins were identified as differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in florets and shreds broccoli compared to control, respectively. Bioinformatic analysis indicated that the DEPs were mainly involved in metabolism, genetic information processing, cellular process, environmental information processing and organismal systems. Salicylic acid (SA) and ethylene (ET) biosynthesis were more susceptible to being induced by wounding with lower intensities, whereas, jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthesis was more susceptible to being activated by wounding with higher intensities. Some carbohydrate metabolic pathways and amino acid biosynthesis-related pathways such as phenylalanine, cysteine and methionine metabolic pathways were significantly up-regulated, which promotes the precursor levels for phenolic substances and glucosinolate synthesis. Biosynthesis of secondary metabolites was activated by wounding through regulation of critical proteins involved in the corresponding metabolic pathways.",

Intact broccoli heads, uniform in size and color and free of physical damage, were selected for sterilization in 0.2 ml/l sodium hypochlorite and then washed with distilled water. The sample treatment and the storage condition in this experiment was in accordance with our previous study<strong>[1]</strong>. Briefly, the broccoli heads were subjected to 2 different wounding intensities: florets and shreds. Florets were 5 cm in diameter and 2 g in weight with a wounding surface diameter of 1 cm; shreds were approximately 0.2 cm in diameter, and 77 shreds weighed approximately 1 g. The whole broccoli heads were used as the control. The wounding intensity was defined as the ratio of the new surface area created by wounding in m^2 divided by the tissue weight in kg according to the previously published method<strong>[2]</strong>. The calculated wounding intensities were 0.04 and 1.85 m^2/kg for florets and shreds, respectively. Subsequently, the broccoli samples were packaged in a polypropylene container with polyethylene film and stored for 12 h at 20 \u00b0C and 95% relative humidity. The collected frozen broccoli samples were stored in an ultra-low-temperature freezer at -80 \u00b0C (DW86L388A, Haier, China). 3 biological replicates of each sample were used in the proteomic analyses. 6 biological replicates of each broccoli sample were used in the metabolomic analyses, and the sample used in metabolomic analyses was the same as our previous study<strong>[1]</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Guan Y, Hu W, Xu Y, Yang X, Ji Y, Feng K, Sarengaowa.

                        "description": "<p>The metabolite identification and quantification of broccoli samples performed in this study were the same as mentioned in our previous report<strong>[1]</strong>. Each ion was identified by combining retention time and m/z data. Intensities of each peaks were recorded and a 3D matrix containing arbitrarily assigned peak indices, sample names and ion intensity information was generated. The online <a href='http://www.kegg.jp/' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>KEGG database</strong></a> was used to annotate the metabolites by matching the exact molecular mass data of samples with those from the database. If a mass difference between observed and the database value was &lt;10 ppm, the metabolite would be annotated and the molecular formula of metabolites would further be identified and validated by the isotopic distribution measurements. An in-house fragment spectrum library of metabolites was used to validate the metabolite identidification. The metabolite data used in this study was a subset of the results of our previous study<strong>[1]</strong>, we combined these metabolite data with proteomic data to explore important metabolic pathways induced by wounding in broccoli.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Guan Y, Hu W, Xu Y, Yang X, Ji Y, Feng K, Sarengaowa.
