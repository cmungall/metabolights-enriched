                "description": "<p>It is well known that the presence of comorbidities and age-related health issues may hide biochemical and metabolic features triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection and other diseases associated to hypoxia, as they are by themselves chronic inflammatory conditions that may potentially disturb metabolic homeostasis and thereby negatively impact on COVID-19 progression. To unveil the metabolic abnormalities inherent to hypoxemia caused by COVID-19, we here applied gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry to analyze the main metabolic changes exhibited by a population of male patients less than 50 years of age with mild/moderate and severe COVID-19 without pre-existing comorbidities known to predispose to life-threatening complications from this infection. Several differences in serum levels of particular metabolites between normal controls and patients with COVID-19 as well as between mild/moderate and severe COVID-19 were identified. These included increased glutamic acid and reduced glutamine, cystine, threonic acid and proline levels. In particular, using the entire metabolomic fingerprint obtained, we observed that glutamine/glutamate metabolism was associated with disease severity as patients in the severe COVID-19 group presented the lowest and higher serum levels of these amino acids, respectively. These data highlight the hypoxia-derived metabolic alterations provoked by SARS-CoV-2 infection in the absence of pre-existing co-morbidities as well as the value of amino acid metabolism in determining reactive oxygen species recycling pathways, which when impaired may lead to increased oxidation of proteins and cell damage. They also provide insights on new supportive therapies for COVID-19 and other disorders that involve altered redox homeostasis and lower oxygen levels that may lead to better outcomes of disease severity.</p>",

All subjects attended a third level referral center in Mexico City (Instituto Nacional de Ciencias M\u00e9dicas y Nutrici\u00f3n Salvador Zubir\u00e1n) from March to October 2020. In total 16 (72.7%) donor patients were classified as mild/moderate on the basis of previously published criteria<strong>[6]</strong> (fever, upper respiratory infection symptoms, with or without pneumonia, O2 saturation at rest &gt;93% and respiratory rate &lt;30 breaths per minute) and followed-up at home, whereas 6 (27.2%) patients were classified as severe [either respiratory failure, O2 saturation &lt;93%, respiratory rate &gt;30 breaths per minute or PaFi (PaO2/FiO2) \u2264300 mmHg] and received in-hospital treatment. In subjects that met the inclusion criteria, blood samples were collected from an antecubital vein and placed in tubes containing clot-activating gel (BD Vacutainer, Becton Dickinson, Mexico). Tubes were inverted 5x and the mixed blood was allowed to clot for 30 min at room temperature, centrifuged at 1300 x g for 15 min, and the resulting serum was then collected with a sterile disposable Pasteur pipette, aliquoted in cryogenic vials and stored at -80 \u00b0C until GC-MS analysis. All included samples were drawn upon admission to the triage area at the emergency department for the patients or at the epidemiology unit for the controls, where hospital staff members attended for randomized nasopharyngeal PCR testing during the morning shift and in a fasting state (minimum 8 h). The study was approved by the institutional ethics and research committees of our institute (Ref. RAI3688/21/22/1). Written informed consent to participate in the study was obtained from all participants. All analytical methods were carried out in accordance with relevant and updated guidelines and regulations. Metabolomics analysis was performed by GC-MS as previously described, with minor modifications<strong>[7]</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Lu J, Xie G, Jia W, Jia W.
