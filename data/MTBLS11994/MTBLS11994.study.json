                "description": "<p>Aging has shown close link to shifts in the skin microbiome in population cohort study. However, how variations in microbial communities relate to divergent skin aging within individuals of the same chronological ages remains unclear. In this study, we performed phenotypic, metabolomic and metagenomic analyses on 103 women aged 39-41 to investigate how skin microbiota mediate metabolic pathways influencing divergent skin aging. The younger group (based on AI-predicted age and skin elasticity) exhibited fewer wrinkles and higher microbial diversity with more potential probiotics. Meanwhile, the older group displayed increased antibiotic resistance genes in microbiota, exacerbating skin aging vulnerability. Using skin metabolomics and genome-scale metabolic models (GEM), our study revealed that S. maltophilia, enriched in younger individuals, utilizes the glutathione cycle for antioxidant defense and protein thiol maintenance. In Vitro experiments and transcriptome analysis further demonstrated that S. maltophilia upregulates key genes, including GCLM, PGD, SOD2 and NQO1, to enhance GSH synthesis and alleviate oxidative stress-induced skin aging. Additionally, S. maltophilia was significantly correlated with WCSC, and GEM analysis further uncovered its potential anti-aging functions in betaine, lysolecithin and porphyrin metabolism. Moreover, we found that A. guillouiae modulates melanin precursor DA and 3-MT, suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy to mitigate pigmentation during skin aging. Together, our findings illustrate the dynamic regulation between skin microbiota and the host in skin aging, independent of chronological age. This study offers new insights for designing targeted anti-aging interventions.</p>",

L-2-chlorophenylalanine was sourced from Shanghai Hengchuang Bio-technology Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China), and chloroform was obtained from Titan Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China). Each sample was treated with a total of 2 mL of pre-chilled methanol-water mixture (4:1, v/v), which was transferred in two portions to glass vial. The samples were then subjected to ultrasonication for 20 min in an ice-water bath. After extraction, samples were allowed to stand at -40 \u00b0C for 30 min before being centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C.&nbsp;Next 1 mL of the supernatant was then transferred to an LC-MS sample vial and dried. For reconstitution, 300 \u00b5L of methanol-water mixture (1:4, v/v) containing 2 \u00b5g/mL of L-2-chlorophenylalanine was added to each sample. Samples were vortexed for 30 s, ultrasonicated for 3 min in an ice-water bath and subsequently rested at -40 \u00b0C for 2 h. Post-resting, samples were centrifuged at 4 \u00b0C (13,000 rpm) for 10 min. A 150 \u00b5L aliquot of the supernatant was drawn with a crystal syringe, filtered through a 0.22 \u00b5m organic phase syringe filter, and transferred into LC vials. The vials were stored at -80 \u00b0C until LC-MS analysis. Quality control (QC) samples were prepared by pooling equal volumes of the extracts from all samples. All reagents used in the extraction process were pre-chilled to -20 \u00b0C prior to use.</p>",
