                "description": "<p>Tumor relapse from treatment-resistant cells (minimal residual disease, MRD) underlies most breast cancer related deaths. Yet, the molecular characteristics defining their malignancy have largely remained elusive. Here we integrated multi-omics data from a tractable organoid system with a metabolic modelling approach to uncover the metabolic and regulatory idiosyncrasies of the MRD. We find that the resistant cells, despite their non-proliferative phenotype and the absence of oncogenic signaling, feature increased glycolysis and activity of certain urea cycle enzymes reminiscent of the tumor. This metabolic distinctiveness was also evident in a mouse model and in transcriptomic data from patients following neo-adjuvant therapy. We further identified a marked similarity in DNA methylation profiles between tumor and residual cells. Taken together, our data reveal a metabolic and epigenetic memory of the treatment-resistant cells. We further demonstrate that the memorized elevated glycolysis in MRD is crucial for their survival and can be targeted using a small molecule inhibitor without impacting normal cells. The metabolic aberrances of MRD thus offer new therapeutic opportunities for post-treatment care to prevent breast tumor recurrence.</p>",

Upon centrifugation (1000 rpm; 5 min, room temperature), the interphase between upper fat layer and cell pellet was removed and 5 ml of 0.25% trypsin-EDTA (Invitrogen, 25200-056) was added. The suspension was incubated for 40 min at 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO2 in loosely capped tubes, followed by a wash with 25 ml of STOP media (Lonza/Amaxa DMEM/F12 1:1 Mixture with HEPES, L-Gln, BE12-719F supplemented with HEPES to the final concentration of 25 mM and 10% Tet System Approved Fetal Bovine Serum, Biowest, S181T) and treatment with 5-15 mg/ml DNase I (ThermoFisher, 18068015).

Next day, cells were washed with PBS and the remaining ones treated with 500 \u00b5l of 0.25% trypsin-EDTA until detachment.

Upon that point, media was changed daily for all the 3 conditions (normal, tumor, residual).

The samples (2 technical replicates, per condition) were pooled, initially from 6, then from 3 wells, as the signal was strong enough to quantify metabolites.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Jechlinger M.

Subsequently, the organoid structures were freed from the Matrigel by adding liberase and collagenase for 1.5 h at 37 \u00b0C to the remaining medium. Following this incubation, the medium was aspirated, the organoids were washed with room temperature PBS and centrifuged (1000 r.p.m., 2 min, room temperature). This step was performed 3x until the addition of 200 \u00b5l cold (-80 \u00b0C) HPLC-grade methanol (Biosolve Chimie, 136841). For metabolite extraction, adonitol (Alfa Aesar, 488-81-3) was added as an internal standard to the mixture of organoids/methanol. The samples were incubated at 72 \u00b0C for 15 min followed by addition of 200 \u03bcl ice-old MilliQ water. Following centrifugation (15000 r.p.m., 10 min, 4 \u00b0C), the supernatants were collected and dried using a GeneVac EZ-2 plus evaporating system (SP Scientific). The dried metabolite extracts were stored at -80 \u00b0C until GC-MS analysis. Metabolite extraction from the spent growth media was performed as described above by adjusting the volume of the extraction solvents to 100 \u00b5l of HPLC-grade methanol and 100 \u00b5l of MilliQ water. Finally, 50 \u00b5l from the initial pure growth medium and from the last washing step with PBS were collected and extracted as the spent growth media samples. The last washing step was employed as control to validate the effective washing of the organoids from the extracellular medium before quenching.</p><p><br></p><p>For experiments following extracellular glucose change after 3BP-treatment, seeding, cell cultivation, oncogene-induction, media change and harvesting for metabolic analyses were done as described above.

Full blown tumors developed in the period of 4-6 weeks and when burden was too large (d = 2 cm), animals were given food without doxycycline which resulted in the fast tumor regression to a non-palpable state. At the timepoint of the complete tumor regression (9 wk after oncogenes deactivation), mammary glands were harvested from these mice, along with the wild-type (non-inducible) siblings, which had the same treatment.</p><p><br></p><p>For the [U-13C]glucose tracing experiment, the harvested mammary glands were dissected, minced and digested for 1.5-2 h at 37 \u00b0C using collagenase and liberase enzymes, then cultured for 8 h at 37 \u00b0C in 5% (vol/vol) CO2 atmosphere, in DMEM glucose- and pyruvate-free medium (ThermoFisher Scientific, 11966025) supplemented with 4.5 g/l labeled D-Glucose U-13C, 99% (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc., CLM-1396) and components from MEGM BulletKit (Lonza, CC-3150). For the non-labeled metabolomics experiment, the harvested mammary glands were dissected and cultured for 8 h at 37 \u00b0C in 5% (v/v) CO2 atmosphere, in DMEM, High Glucose (4.5 g/l glucose) GlutaMAX (Gibco, 10569044) supplemented with components from MEGM BulletKit (Lonza, CC-3150). For both the isotope tracing and unlabeled experiments, 50 \u00b5l from the spent growth media were collected following the 8 h incubation period. For intracellular metabolomics, the mammary glands were collected following the 8 h incubation period, washed with room temperature PBS and centrifuged (1000 r.p.m., 2 min, room temperature). The washing procedure was performed 3x before the addition of 200 \u00b5l cold (-80 \u00b0C) HPLC-grade methanol.
