                "description": "<p>Systems biology is the study of complex living organisms, and as such, analysis on a systems-wide scale involves the collection of information-dense data sets that are representative of an entire phenotype. To uncover dynamic biological mechanisms, bioinformatics tools have become essential to facilitating data interpretation in large-scale analyses. Global metabolomics is one such method for performing systems biology, as metabolites represent the downstream functional products of ongoing biological processes. We have developed XCMS Online, a platform that enables online metabolomics data processing and interpretation. A systems biology workflow recently implemented within XCMS Online enables rapid metabolic pathway mapping using raw metabolomics data for investigating dysregulated metabolic processes. In addition, this platform supports integration of multi-omic (such as genomic and proteomic) data to garner further systems-wide mechanistic insight. Here, we provide an in-depth procedure showing how to effectively navigate and use the systems biology workflow within XCMS Online without a priori knowledge of the platform, including uploading liquid chromatography (LC)-mass spectrometry (MS) data from metabolite-extracted biological samples, defining the job parameters to identify features, correcting for retention time deviations, conducting statistical analysis of features between sample classes and performing predictive metabolic pathway analysis. Additional multi-omics data can be uploaded and overlaid with previously identified pathways to enhance systems-wide analysis of the observed dysregulations. We also describe unique visualization tools to assist in elucidation of statistically significant dysregulated metabolic pathways. Parameter input takes 5-10 min, depending on user experience; data processing typically takes 1-3 h, and data analysis takes ~30 min.</p>",

Carbon concentration was based on a final concentration of 20 mM glucose or 0.12 M carbon. All carbon sources were prepared in sterile water, then filtered through a 0.22 \u00b5m syringe filter prior to addition to M9 salts. A 10 ml culture of E. coli was grown in LB media overnight at 37 \u00b0C. To inoculate each condition, a 1 ml aliquot of cells was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 1 min, the supernatant media was removed and the pellet was washed 3 times with sterile water. The cells were made up to a final volume of 1 ml in sterile water and a 1 \u00b5l aliquot was added to 8 ml of each carbon source. The cultures were grown until an OD600 ~1, or stopped after 72 hr if the growth rate was plateaued. Triplicate 1 ml aliquots were taken for each replicate for metabolomics analysis and duplicate 1 ml samples were taken for RNA sequencing.</p>",

A Phenomenex Luna NH2 column (1 mm x 150 mm, 3 \u00b5m particle size, 100 \u00c5 pore size) was used for LC separation. Mobile phase A was 20 mM ammonium acetate in H2O with 5% acetonitrile (ACN), and mobile phase B was ACN with 5% H2O. The gradient elution profile was as follows: t  = 0 min, 95% B; t = 5 min, 95% B; t = 50 min, 5% B. t = 63 min, 5% B. The flow rate was 50 \u00b5l/min. 20 min post acquisition time was also added with 95% B to re-equilibrium the LC column. Injection of 1 \u00b5l sodium formate (250 \u00b5M) occurred at t = 57 min and eluted on t = 61 min. This calibration peak was used to internally calibrate the LC-MS data and also served as the MS peak intensity quality control.",
