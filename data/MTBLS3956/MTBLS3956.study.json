After 6-h treatment, all cell samples were taken at the same time, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 \u00b0C until required.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Zhao K, Liu HY, Zhou MM, Liu JX.

The mobile phase of composition A consists of water, 25 mmol/L ammonium formate and 0.1% formic acid, and B was 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile. The gradient elution procedure was as follows: 85% B (0.0-1.0 min); B varied linearly from 85 to 50% (1.0-11.0 min), B was maintained at 40% (11.1-12.0 min), B increased linearly from 40 to 75% (12.0-12.1 min), and finally B was maintained at 75% (12.1-19.0 min). The sample was placed in a 4 \u00b0C autosampler. In order to avoid the effects of instrument detection signal fluctuations, continuous analysis of samples was performed randomly.
