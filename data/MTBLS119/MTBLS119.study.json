                "description": "Several xylem-associated regulatory genes have been identified that control processes associated with wood formation in poplar. Prominent among these are the NAC domain transcription factors (NACs). We evaluated the putative involvement of Populus NAC154, a co-ortholog of the Arabidopsis gene SND2, as a regulator of secondary biosynthetic processes in stem internode tissues by interrogating methanol:water extracts from control and transgenic trees. Comprehensive untargeted metabolite profiling was accomplished with a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry platform that utilized two different chromatographic supports (HILIC and reversed phase) and both positive and negative ionization modes. Evaluation of current and previous year tissues provided datasets for assessing the effects of NAC154 overexpression in wood maturation processes. Phenolic glycoside levels as well as those of oligolignols, sucrose and arginine were modulated with phenotypic and chemotypic traits exhibiting similar trends. Specifically, increased levels of arginine in the NAC154 overexpressing tissues supports a role for the transcription factor in senescence/dormancy-associated processes.",

For current year shoot segments, we defined LPI 1 as the first leaf below the shoot tip that was at least 1 cm in length (internode 1 would be directly above this), and counted down to collect internode 12.  For the previous year growth, internode 1 was assigned as below the terminal bud scar, counting down the stem to internode 7.   Since trees showed different amounts of growth (number of internodes) in a given year, a continuous internode counting down from the shoot tip to the previous year's growth was not applicable.  Samples in the laboratory were stored at -80 \u00b0C prior to processing, which was initiated by freeze-drying to a constant weight.  Twigs were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and subsequently ground in a P14 mill (Pulveristette 14; Fritsch) with a 0.5 mm sieve at maximum speed (20,000 rpm) to generate a fine powder.  The samples were collected in labeled, pre-weighed 1.5 ml centrifuge tubes, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and dried, after which the mass was recorded.",

The separation initially started with 95% A (0-1 min) with a linear ramp to 85% A (1.0-1.5 min), followed by a second ramp to 40% A (1.5-6.9 min).  The gradient was rapidly ramped to 10% A (6.9-7.0 min) where it was held for 0.5 min (7.0-7.5 min).  Re-equilibration involved ramping back to 95% A (7.5-8.0 min) and holding at 95% A for 2 min (8.0-10.0 min).  Injection volumes were 1 ul, the column temperature was 40 \u00b0C, with the autosampler maintained at 8 \u00b0C. Under these conditions acetaminophen elutes at 2.07 min (m/z = 152.0708 in positive mode and m/z = 150.0556 in negative mode).
