                "description": "<p>In annually reoccurring patterns, microalgae form blooms that persist and decline thereby contributing massively to global biogeochemical cycles. The decline of blooms is mainly caused by nutrient limitation and goes ahead with the aging of individual algal cells. Nutrient intake can re-initiate proliferation, but the processes involved are poorly understood. By investigating the bloom-forming diatom Coscinodiscus radiatus, we demonstrate how algae recover after nutrient influx. The rejuvenation physiology of the algae is characterized by metabolomic re-organization and the formation of extracellular vesicles. Regulated pathways mediating aging are centered around the methionine cycle in C. radiatus. Vesicles shuttle reactive oxygen species, oxylipins and other harmful metabolites out of the old cells, thereby re-enabling their proliferation. Metabolic processes involved in aging and vesicle production are modulated by bacteria. Using chemical signaling bacteria can trigger vesicle production thereby releasing organic nutrients for their growth and supporting algal growth as well.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Metabolomics profiling of FACS purified EVs</strong>&nbsp;is reported in the current study&nbsp;<a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS5401' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS5401</strong></a>.</p><p><strong>Metabolomics analysis</strong>&nbsp;is reported in&nbsp;<a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS5368' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS5368</strong></a>.</p>",

                        "description": "<p><strong>Strains, media and cultivation</strong></p><p>The diatom Coscinodiscus radiatus was obtained from the Roscoff culture collection RCC 7277 (https://roscoff-culture-collection.org/rcc-strain-details/7277). The bacteria Mameliella sp. CS4 and Marinobacter sp. CS1 were isolated in our lab as described previously<strong>[1]</strong>. C. radiatus was cultivated in sterile Guillard\u2019s (f/2) enrichment medium (G9903, Sigma-Aldrich) prepared with natural seawater (ATI, Helgoland, Germany). To optimize the growth of diatom, silicate was added to reach the final concentration of 400 \u03bcM and the medium was noted as f/2+Si. Depending on the volume, cultures were maintained in tissue culture (TC) Flasks (T175 for 150 mL cultures, T25 for 20 mL cultures Sarstedt, Numbrecht, Germany). 300 \u03bcL cultures were grown in 48 well plates and 100 \u03bcL cultures were grown in 96 well plates (Sarstedt, Numbrecht, Germany). Cultures were maintained at 13 \u00b0C with a light: dark cycle of 15:9 h and light intensity of 25 \u03bcmol/m^2/s for running experiments and 20 \u03bcmol/m^2/s for storage.</p><p><br></p><p>For the preparation of axenic cultures, we applied a previously used method to minimize the bacterial community from C. radiatus<strong>[1]</strong>. Briefly, the cells were washed with 20 \u03bcg/mL Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) on a filter (40 \u03bcm pore size, pluriSelect, Leipzig, Germany) followed by treatment with antibiotics, 50 \u03bcg/mL kanamycin and 20 \u03bcg/mL ciprofloxacin overnight. After another filter process, the antibiotics were removed by repeated centrifugation and washing with excess fresh f/2+Si medium. Cells were re-suspended in a sterile Falcon tube. Young cells were stored under low light intensity in an incubator and used within a week. Old cells were used for the experiment on the same day of the filtration process. No bacteria were detectable under microscope and after plating out on marine broth (MB, Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany) agar plates (1.5% agar). Note: Since the diatoms are closely associated with bacteria the cultures are strongly reduced in bacteria after the treatment but not necessarily entirely axenic.</p><p><br></p><p>Bacterial cultures were prepared from single colonies picked from marine broth (MB, Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany) agar plates (1.5% agar). Picked colonies were transferred into 3 mL liquid MB medium in 10 mL sterile tubes and grown at 28 \u00b0C with 150 rpm shaking. When the cultures reached the late exponential phase at an OD600 0.4-0.7, 30 \u03bcL were transferred into 3 mL fresh MB. When the cultures reached an OD600=0.4-0.7, they were harvested by centrifugation at room temperature, washed 2 times with f/2+Si medium to remove the MB medium and resuspended in f/2+Si medium to reach an OD600=0.4 (about 5 x 10^6 cells/mL).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Metabolomics profiling of FACS purified EVs</strong></p><p>The experimental work flow is depicted in <strong>Extended Data Figure 8A</strong> in the paper associated with this study. Old cells were used for EV production 2 days after inoculation into fresh medium. Diatom cells were removed by filtration on 40 \u03bcm filters. The filtrates containing EVs were left for settlement of the vesicles for 30 min. Then, the vesicles were concentrated. The enriched EV samples were stained with the ROS probe CDCFDA for 15 min in the dark before fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) purified EVs FACS analysis. Vesicles were analyzed and sorted with a BD FACSAria Fusion (BD Biosciences , San Jose, CA, USA). The solution containing 3.5% sea-salt (Instant Ocean, Aquarium Systems, Mentor, OH, US) was used as FACS running buffer. Sorting temperature was kept at room temperature. Vesicles were sorted into 5 mL FACS-tubes (Falcon). Chlorophyll a fluorescence was detected in the BV650 channel. The ROS-dye CDCFDA was detected in the FITC channel. As the single staining for ROS-dye CDCFDA could not be created, compensation was not performed. [GP1]&nbsp;[YD2]&nbsp;To control for media contamination in the sorted vesicle-containing droplets, Accu-drop beads (BD) were diluted into the corresponding supernatant and sorted as above. The total sorted events for each sample are listed in <strong>Table S2</strong>. FACS purified EV and control samples were dried in a Vacufuge plus vacuum concentrator (Eppendorf) for 2 h. The dried samples were dissolved in 300 \u03bcL methanol and centrifuged at 16,100 x g for 10 min. The supernatant of 10 \u03bcL was loaded on the LC-MS for untargeted metabolomics profiling as described above.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Deng Y, Mauri M, Vallet M, Staudinger M, Allen RJ, Pohnert G.
