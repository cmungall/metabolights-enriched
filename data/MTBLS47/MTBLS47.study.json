                "description": "Despite recent intensive research efforts in functional genomics, the functions of only a limited number of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) genes have been determined experimentally. Thus, improving gene annotation remains a major challenge in plant science. Because metabolite profiling can characterize the metabolomic phenotype of a genetic perturbation of plant metabolism, it provides clues to the function of genes of interest. In this regard, we chose 50 Arabidopsis mutants including a set of characterized and uncharacterized mutants, which resemble wild-type plants. We performed metabolite profiling of the plants using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). To make the dataset available as an efficient public functional genomics tool for hypothesis generation, we developed the MeKO database, which allows evaluation of whether a mutation affects metabolism during normal growth. This database contains images of mutants, statistical data analyses, and data on differential metabolite accumulation. Non-processed data, including chromatograms, mass spectra, and experimental meta-data, follow the guidelines of the Metabolomics Standards Initiative (MSI) and are freely downloadable. Proof-of-concept analysis suggests that the MeKO database is highly useful for gene annotation and for generation of hypotheses for genes of interest. MeKO is publicly available at http://prime.psc.riken.jp/meko/.",

The aerial regions were harvested with 20 different biological replicates, 6 h after the onset of the bright phase. All plant materials were frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen to quench enzymatic activity. Harvested samples with a fresh weight (FW) over 7 mg were used for GC-MS-based metabolite profiling.

The normalized response for calculating the signal intensity of each metabolite from the mass-detector response was obtained with each selected ion current unique in each metabolite MS spectrum to normalize the peak response. For quality control, we injected methylstearate in every 6 samples.

The metabolites were identified by comparison with the RIs from library databases (GMD and our own library) and with the mass spectra of authentic standards, and the metabolites were defined as annotated metabolites upon comparison with the mass spectra and RIs from these two libraries. The 5 batches of metabolite profiles were combined using the HDA method [1][2].
