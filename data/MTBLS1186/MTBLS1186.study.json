                "description": "<p>Associations between animals and microbes affect not only the immediate tissues where they occur, but also the entire host. Metabolomics, the study of small biomolecules generated during metabolic processes, provides a window into how mutualistic interactions shape host biochemistry. The Hawaiian bobtail squid, Euprymna scolopes, is amenable to metabolomic studies of symbiosis because the host can be reared with or without its species-specific symbiont, Vibrio fischeri. In addition, unlike many invertebrates, the host squid has a closed circulatory system. This feature allows a direct sampling of the refined collection of metabolites circulating through the body, a focused approach that has been highly successful with mammals. Here, we show that rearing E. scolopes without its natural symbiont significantly affected one quarter of the more than 100 hemolymph metabolites defined by gas chromatography mass-spectrometry analysis. Further, as in mammals, which harbor complex consortia of bacterial symbionts, the metabolite signature oscillated on symbiont-driven daily rhythms and was dependent on the sex of the host. Thus, our results provide evidence that the population of even a single symbiont species can influence host hemolymph biochemistry as a function of symbiotic state, host sex, and circadian rhythm.</p>",

Prior to inoculation, a subculture was grown to an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of ~0.6 in seawater-tryptone medium (SWT)<strong>[3]</strong>. Bacteria were added to the squid\u2019s seawater at a final concentration of ~10^4 colony-forming units (CFU) per ml for ~12 h. Colonization was confirmed for each animal at 24 h postinoculation by checking luminescence output using a TD-20/20 luminometer (Turner Design, Sunnyvale, CA, USA).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Animal husbandry</strong></p><p>Specimens of E. scolopes were collected in Maunalua Bay, Hawai\u02bbi, and transported to the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The squid were maintained in Instant Ocean artificial seawater (Spectrum Brands, Blacksburg, VA, USA) as previously described<strong>[4]</strong>. Egg clutches were incubated in 9.5 l aquaria<strong>[5]</strong>. Within 12 h of hatching, juvenile squid were either inoculated with V. fischeri or maintained APO overnight, and introduced into rearing vessels the following morning. Hatchlings from different egg clutches were maintained separately. The squid were maintained on a 12-h light/12-h dark schedule, and reared as previously described for 6 wk[5]. Briefly, 25-60 squid were housed per vessel and fed live mysid shrimp (Mysidopsis bahia) 3-6 times per day. At 8 wk post-hatching, the squid were transferred to 65 l black high-density polyethylene tanks with 6-10 squid per tank as they approached maturity. Each tank contained a hang-on biofilter to maintain water quality, and 50% (by volume) water changes were performed every 3 d or more often if required. The squid were fed freshwater shrimp (Palemonetes spp.) overnight with the average size used increasing with that of the squid. Maintenance of SYM or APO conditions in each tank was monitored by periodically plating 50 \u00b5l of seawater onto LBS and examining for the presence (SYM) or absence (APO) of growth of V. fischeri colonies.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Hemolymph sampling</strong></p><p>Prior to sampling, squid were confirmed to be either SYM or APO (see above). At least 8 animals were sampled for each treatment group (male/symbiotic, male/aposymbiotic, female/symbiotic, female/aposymbiotic) to ensure comparability. Squid were anesthetized with 2% ethanol in seawater, and hemolymph was extracted from the cephalic artery using a 28-gauge needle at 3 times over the day-night cycle: 1100 h (5 h after dawn), 1900 h (2 h after dusk) and 0400 h (2 h before dawn). Each squid was sampled only once, with 125-200 \u00b5l of hemolymph recovered.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Boettcher KJ and Ruby EG.
