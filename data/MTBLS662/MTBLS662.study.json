                "description": "Regulation of seed germination by dormancy relies on a complex network of transcriptional and post\u2010transcriptional modifications during seed imbibition that controls seed adaptive responses to environmental cues. High\u2010throughput technologies have brought significant progress in the understanding of this phenomenon and have led to identify major regulators of seed germination, mostly by studying the behaviour of highly differentially expressed genes. However, the actual models of transcriptome analysis cannot catch additive effects of small variations of gene expression in individual signalling or metabolic pathways, which are also likely to control germination. Therefore, the comprehension of the molecular mechanism regulating germination is still incomplete and to gain knowledge about this process we have developed a pathway\u2010based analysis of transcriptomic Arabidopsis datasets, to identify regulatory actors of seed germination. The method allowed quantifying the level of deregulation of a wide range of pathways in dormant versus non\u2010dormant seeds. Clustering pathway deregulation scores of germinating and dormant seed samples permitted the identification of mechanisms involved in seed germination such as RNA transport or vitamin B6 metabolism, for example. Using this method, which was validated by metabolomics analysis, we also demonstrated that Col and Cvi seeds follow different metabolic routes for completing germination, demonstrating the genetic plasticity of this process. We finally provided an extensive basis of analysed transcriptomic datasets that will allow further identification of mechanisms controlling seed germination.",

Here 90 ml N-methyl-N-trimethylsilyl-trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA) (Regis Technologies, Morton Grove, IL, USA) were then added and the reaction continued for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C. After cooling, 80 \u03bcl were transferred to an Agilent vial for injection.\n</br></br>\nAt 4 h after derivatization, 1 \u03bcl of sample was injected in splitless mode on an Agilent 7890B gas chromatograph coupled to an Agilent 5977A mass spectrometer. The column was an Rxi-5SilMS from Restek (30 m with 10 m Integra-Guard column). An injection in split mode with a ratio of 1:30 was systematically performed for saturated compounds quantification. Oven temperature ramp was 60 \u00b0C for 1 min then 10 \u00b0C/min to 325 \u00b0C for 10 min. Helium constant flow was 1.1 ml/min. Temperatures were the following: injector: 250 \u00b0C, transfer line: 290 \u00b0C, source: 230 \u00b0C and quadropole 150 \u00b0C.\n</br></br>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Fiehn O.

                        "description": "All experiments were repeated independently 3 times. For metabolomics, normalized data (mean-center) were drawn as a clustered metabolomic array (heat map) using MeV 4.1 open source software[1]. Metabolites considered to vary significantly between the time points were observed using Wilcoxon\u2212Mann\u2212Whitney non-arametric test and with P < 0.05 as a significance threshold value with false discovery rate (FDR) correction less than P < 0.05. The metabolites were clustered using complete linkage over the samples using Pearson correlation distance matrix. The non-parametric test and the clustering were made using a Multi Experiment Viewer (TM4)[1].\n</br></br>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Saeed AI, Sharov V, White J, Li J, Liang W, Bhagabati N, Braisted J, Klapa M, Currier T, Thiagarajan M, Sturn A, Snuffin M, Rezantsev A, Popov D, Ryltsov A, Kostukovich E, Borisovsky I, Liu Z, Vinsavich A, Trush V, Quackenbush J.
