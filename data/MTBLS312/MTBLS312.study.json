                "description": "Foliar stomatal movements are critical for regulating plant water loss and gas exchange. Elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) levels are known to induce stomatal closure. However, the current knowledge on CO2 signal transduction in stomatal guard cells is limited. Here we report metabolomic responses of Brassica napus guard cells to elevated CO2 using three hyphenated metabolomics platforms: gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (MS); liquid chromatography (LC)-multiple reaction monitoring-MS; and ultra-high-performance LC-quadrupole time-of-flight-MS. A total of 358 metabolites from guard cells were quantified in a time-course response to elevated CO2 level. Most metabolites increased under elevated CO2, showing the most significant differences at 10 min. In addition, reactive oxygen species production increased and stomatal aperture decreased with time. Major alterations in flavonoid, organic acid, sugar, fatty acid, phenylpropanoid and amino acid metabolic pathways indicated changes in both primary and specialized metabolic pathways in guard cells. Most interestingly, the jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthesis pathway was significantly altered in the course of elevated CO2 treatment. Together with results obtained from JA biosynthesis and signaling mutants as well as CO2 signaling mutants, we discovered that CO2-induced stomatal closure is mediated by JA signaling.",

Seeds were germinated on a half-strength Murashige and Skoog[2] media prior to transferring to soil in growth chambers.\n</p>\nSmall squares (0.5 x 0.5 cm^2) of leaf pieces from 8-weeks-old B. napus plants were fixed abaxial side down onto coverslips coated with medical adhesive (Hollister, Libertyville, IL, USA). Abaxial epidermis and mesophyll layers were removed with a scalpel. After washing three times with distilled water to remove cellular debris, the coverslips were incubated with a cell-wall-digesting enzyme mixture containing 0.1% (w/v) PVP-40 (Calbiochem, Billerica, Massachusetts, USA), 0.25% (w/v) BSA (Research Products International, Mt Prospect, Illinois, USA), 0.7% Cellulase R-10 (Yakult Honsha, Tokyo, Japan) and 0.025% Macerozyme R-10 (Yakult Honsha, Tokyo, Japan) in 55% basic solution (0.55 m sorbitol, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm ascorbic acid, 10 \u00b5m KH2PO4, 5 mm MES-Tris, pH 5.5 adjusted with 1 m KOH) at 26 \u00b0C, 140 excursions per min for 13 min. The coverslips were then incubated with a stomatal opening buffer (10 mm KCl, 50 \u00b5m CaCl2, 10 mm MES-KOH, adjusted to pH 6.15 with 1 m KOH) under light (110 \u00b5mol/m^2/s) for 1 h. For elevated CO2 treatment, the open stomata were exposed continuously to 800 ppm CO2 for a period of 60 min as previously described[1].\n</p>\nFor ROS measurement, 30 \u00b5m 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCFDA) was added to the opening buffer and incubated with epidermal peels for 40 min. After washing with opening buffer to remove excess dye, the stomata were transferred to an infusion chamber, which contained the stomatal opening buffer pre-equilibrated with 400 ppm (control) or 800 ppm CO2 (elevated CO2 treatment).\n</p>\nAll sample preparation, data acquisition, reporting of chemical analysis and metadata related to data pre-processing, pre-treatment, processing, post-processing, statistical analysis and interpretation have been performed in compliance with the MSI. Stomata from B. napus leaves were prepared as recently described[4].\n</p>\nAll the samples were stabilized in 400 ppm CO2 (control) for 15 min before continuing in control or switching to 800 ppm CO2 (treatment) conditions[3]. The samples were collected at 0, 5, 10, 30 and 60 min on 100 \u00b5m nylon mesh. The samples were quickly frozen (~30 sec) in liquid nitrogen and then lyophilized before metabolite extraction.\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Zhu M, Simons B, Zhu N, Oppenheimer DG, Chen S.

Prior to extraction, internal standard mixture (10 \u00b5l; 100 \u00b5m each of lidocaine, 10-camphorsulfonic acid and adonitol) was added to each sample. Metabolites were extracted following an established method[1].

Optimized detection conditions including precursor ion, product ion, declustering potential, collision energy and cell exit potential were established for 277 authentic compounds including phytohormones (see Table S1 in the paper associated with this study). A reverse-phase C18 column (Agilent, Eclipse XDB-C18, 4.6 x 250 mm, 5 \u00b5m) was used for metabolite separation with 0.1% formic acid in water as solvent A and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile as solvent B. The LC gradient was initially held at 1% solvent B for 5 min, then a linear gradient was imposed from 1% B to 99.5% B over 41.5 min, followed by holding at 99.5% B for 4.5 min, and then return to 1% B. The flow rate was 0.5 ml/min, and the total analysis time was 1 h.\n</p>\nGC-MS:</br>\nGas chromatography-MS was performed using a Thermo Scientific ISQ\u2122 single-quadrupole system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Framingham, MA, USA). Extracted samples were derivatized as described[1]. Derivatized samples (1 \u00b5l) were injected onto a Rtx-5Sil MS, 30 m x 0.25 mm column with 10 m integrated guard column, 0.25 \u00b5m film thickness (Restek GmbH, Bad Homburg, Germany) in splitless mode. Helium was used as a carrier gas. The oven temperature was held constant at 70 \u00b0C for 1 min, and then ramped to 76 \u00b0C in 6 min followed by a 45 min ramp to 350 \u00b0C, and held constant at 350 \u00b0C for 1 min, then held constant at 330 \u00b0C for 10 min.\n</p>\nUPLC-MS</br>\nFor UHPLC-QToF MS, lyophilized extracts were reconstituted in 100 \u00b5l 80% methanol with 18 \u00b5g/ml umbelliferone as an internal standard. The mixture was vortexed for 15 min, then sonicated for 5 min, vortexed again for 10 min, and finally centrifuged at 12 000 rpm for 15 min. Data were collected on a Waters Acquity UHPLC system (Waters, Milford, MA, USA) connected to Waters Premium hybrid QToF MS using an ESI interface. An ACQUITY UHPLC BEH C18 column (1.7 \u00b5m, 2.1 x 150 mm; Waters, Milford, MA, USA) was used with 0.05% formic acid in water (solvent A) and 0.05% formic acid in acetonitrile (solvent B). The UHPLC gradient conditions for solvent B were as follows: 5\u201370% B step gradient over 30 min, then 70\u201395% for 3 min, then holding at 95% for 3 min, and finally back to 5% B over 3 min. The mobile phase flow rate was 560 \u00b5l/min, and the column temperature was kept constant at 60 \u00b0C.\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Lisec J, Schauer N, Kopka J, Willmitzer L, Fernie AR Gas chromatography mass spectrometry-based metabolite profiling in plants.

The MS conditions were: 30 psi for curtain gas, 50 psi GS1, 55 psi GS2, ion source voltage at \u00b1 4500 V, with the turbo electro spray ionization (ESI) interface temperature at 350 \u00b0C.\n</p>\nA multiple-period (segment) method was followed as previously described[1]. In brief, QQQ scans were acquired as MRM experiments with collision gas (nitrogen) set to 5 psi. Selection of Q3 masses, DP, and CE for individual MRM transitions was done as the basis of targeted EPI experiments with further DP and CE optimization. A specific set of MRM transitions were monitored for each period according to the metabolites eluted within this period. 110 and 96 MRM transitions were monitored in positive mode for the first and the third periods, respectively. For the second period, 66 MRM transitions in positive mode and 11 transitions in negative mode (for the detection of phytohormones) were detected. Each MRM transition was obtained with a 5-ms Dwell time and a 5-ms pause time, and the scan mode change was set for 700 ms. The total cycle time was 1.2, 1.6, and 1.1 s from the first period to the third period, respectively, which ensured at least 10 points were obtained for each peak.
