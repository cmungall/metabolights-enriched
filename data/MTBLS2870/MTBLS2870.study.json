                "description": "Root-microbe interaction and its specialized root nodule structures and functions are well studied. In contrast, leaf nodules harboring microbial endophytes in special glandular leaf structures have only recently gained increased interest as plant-microbe phyllosphere interactions. Here, we applied a comprehensive metabolomics platform in combination with natural product isolation and characterization to dissect leaf and leaf nodule metabolism and functions in <i>Ardisia crenata</i> (Primulaceae) and <i>Psychotria punctata</i> (Rubiaceae). The results indicate that abiotic stress resilience plays an important part within the leaf nodule symbiosis of both species. Both species showed metabolic signatures of enhanced nitrogen assimilation/dissimilation pattern and increased polyamine levels in nodules compared to leaf lamina tissue potentially involved in senescence processes and photosynthesis. Multiple links to cytokinin and REDOX-active pathways were found. Our results further demonstrate that secondary metabolite production by endophytes is a key feature of this symbiotic system. Multiple anhydromuropeptides (AhMP) and their derivatives were identified as highly characteristic biomarkers for nodulation within both species. A novel epicatechin derivative was structurally elucidated with NMR and shown to be enriched within the leaf nodules of <i>A. crenata</i>. This enrichment within nodulated tissues was also observed for catechin and other flavonoids indicating that flavonoid metabolism may play an important role for leaf nodule symbiosis of <i>A. crenata.</i> In contrast, pavettamine was only detected in <i>P. punctata</i> and showed no nodule specific enrichment but a developmental effect. Further natural products were detected, including three putative unknown depsipeptide structures in <i>A. crenata</i> leaf nodules. The analysis presents a first metabolomics reference data set for the intimate interaction of microbes and plants in leaf nodules, reveals novel metabolic processes of plant-microbe interaction as well as the potential of natural product discovery in these systems.",

Voucher specimens were deposited at the Herbarium of the University of Vienna (<em>Ardisia crenata</em>: WU 0120874; <em>Psychotria punctata</em>: WU 0120875), and collection data and scans are available at the herbarium database system <a href='http://jacq.org/' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>JACQ</a>.</p><p><br></p><p>The plants were cultivated in a climate and light controlled greenhouse at the Department of Functional and Evolutionary Ecology at the University of Vienna. In the present study, 4 different leaf conditions for P. punctata, as well as 6 conditions for A. crenata were sampled.

Additionally, 9 blanks starting from solvent extraction of empty tubes were included into the experiment. To account for biological variability and to get enough material from nodulated tissues, samples from 4 different individuals of the same species were pooled to create 1 biological replicate, as previously described<strong>[1]</strong>. The different conditions were developing nodulated leaf tissue and developing non-nodulated leaf tissue, mature nodulated leaf tissue and mature non-nodulated leaf tissue. For the species <em>A. crenata</em>, the 2 additional conditions were oldest mature (non-senescent leaves distinguished from mature by their position as the basalmost leaves still attached to the shoot of the plant) nodulated leaf tissue and oldest mature non-nodulated leaf tissue (see <strong>Fig. 1</strong> in the paper associated with this study).</p><p><br></p><p>For <em>A. crenata</em> the nodules on the leaf margin were harvested as the nodulated leaf tissue (dedicated as nodulated tissue) and the tissue near the primary leaf nerve as the non-nodulated leaf tissue (dedicated as lamina tissue). For the developmental stages, the first fully unfolded leaves were chosen as the developing leaf tissue (<strong>stage I</strong>). The basalmost non-senescent leaves on the lateral branches were chosen as the mature leaf tissue (<strong>stage II</strong>) and the lowest non-senescent leaves on the shoots were chosen as the oldest mature leaf tissue (<strong>stage III</strong>).</p><p><br></p><p>For <em>P. punctata</em> the nodules on the leaves were harvested as the nodulated leaf tissue by using a glass tube and a section where the nodules had been removed as the non-nodulated leaf tissue.

In addition, pooled samples of all conditions were collected for each species to be used in method development and method evaluation.

All materials were prechilled in liquid nitrogen and 30\u201350 mg of frozen plant powder was weighed in 2 ml Safe-Lock tubes (Eppendorf, Vienna, Austria). The metabolites were extracted using a modified extraction procedure reported previously<strong>[1]</strong>. Briefly, 1 ml ice cold methanol (MeOH) (HPLC grade, VWR, Vienna, Austria) was added to frozen plant powder, the mixture was vortexed and sonicated in an ice bath for 20 min. After centrifugation at 14,800 rpm and 4 \u00b0C for 4 min using a Fresco 21 Microcentrifuge (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States) the supernatant was collected in 2 ml amber glass vials (Agilent Technologies, CA, United States). The extract was dried under a gentle stream of nitrogen 5.0 (\u226599.999%, Air Liquide, Vienna, Austria) using a REACTI-VAP III  TS-18826 Evaporation Unit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States). The remaining cell pellet was re-extracted with 1 ml MeOH following the same procedure and the supernatant was again added to the glass vial. Extraction was carried out 4 times in total and extracts were dried until weight consistency was achieved. To generate 2 equal aliquots for GC- and LC-MS analysis, extracts were redissolved in 1 ml MeOH, separated into 2x 1.5 ml Safe-Lock Eppendorf tubes and dried in a vacuum concentrator ScanSpeed 40 (SCANVAC, LaboGene, Aller\u00f8d, Denmark) connected to a CoolSafe SCANVAC and VACUUM PUMP RZ 2.5 vacuubrand (VACUUBRAND GMBH + CO KG, Wertheim, Germany).

                        "description": "<p><strong>GC-MS analysis:</strong></p><p>Internal standards were prepared as follows: stock solutions of 5 mM pentaerythritol (PE) and 50 mM phenyl-\u03b2-d-glucopyranoside (PGP) were dissolved in milliQ water and combined 1:1 (v/v) as internal standard mix. 10 \u00b5l were added to respective sample aliquots for GC-MS analyses and dried in a vacuum concentrator. Dried extracts were derivatized batch-wise directly before analyses by GC-MS. 1 batch consisted of 14\u201319 randomly selected samples, 1 blank and a standard solution of even numbered alkanes at 50 mg/ml in hexane (C10\u2013C40, Sigma-Aldrich, Vienna, Austria) for determination of retention indices. A mix of metabolite standards was also included in different concentration in order to confirm metabolite identifications, resulting in MSI level I identifications (see <strong>Tables S1, S2</strong> in the paper associated with this study)<strong>[1][2]</strong>. As the dynamic range of analytes within a sample was too high to quantify all peaks in 1 run, each sample and standard mix were injected in 2 split rates, 1:5 and 1:50, respectively. Low abundant analytes were quantified in 1:5. Analytes with too high abundances resulting in overloading the column and the detector were only quantified in analyses performed with a higher split rate of injection of 1:50 as indicated in <strong>Table S2</strong> in the paper associated with this study.</p><p><br></p><p>Derivatization was performed as described earlier<strong>[3]</strong> with just slightly changed volumes of reagents. Briefly, 40 \u00b5l of methoxyamine hydrochloride solution in pyridine were used to dissolve the metabolite pellet. Including 80 \u00b5l of N-methyl-N-trimethylsilyl-trifluoroacetamid (Macherey-Nagel, D\u00fcren, Germany) the total derivatization volume was 120 \u00b5l. GC-MS analyses were performed using an Agilent 6890 gas chromatograph (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, United States) coupled to a LECO Pegasus 4D GC x GC-TOF mass spectrometer (LECO Corporation, MI, United States). Materials and instrument settings were used as described earlier<strong>[3][4]</strong>. Briefly, the Split/Splitless injector was equipped with an Ultra Inert single tapered glass liner with deactivated glass wool (Agilent Technologies Sales &amp; Services GmbH &amp; Co.KG, Waldbronn, Germany) and the temperature was set to 230\u00b0C. Components were separated on an Agilent HP-5MS column (30 m length, 0.25 mm diameter, 0.25 \u03bcm film). The oven temperature gradient was used as follows: initial temperature was set to 70 \u00b0C, held for 1 min, ramped to 330 \u00b0C and held for 8 min. Data were acquired using an acquisition rate of 20 spectra/s and a detector voltage of 1,625 V. Acquisition delay was set to 260 s.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>LC-MS analysis:</strong></p><p>For the RP-HPLC-HRESIMS measurements a method was used similar to the one previously described<strong>[3]</strong>. The plant extracts were dissolved in a concentration of 10 mg/l in a solvent consisting of (98% water, 2% acetonitrile (ACN)) + 0.1% formic acid (FA) containing the internal standards ampicillin, chloramphenicol and reserpine each in a concentration of 1 x 10^\u22125 mol/l. After the solvent was added the samples were vortexed and sonicated to aid solvation. The samples were centrifuged at 14,800 rpm at 4 \u00b0C for 10 min and 100 \u00b5l of the supernatants were transferred into glass inserts for analysis. The samples were placed into an autosampler at 4 \u00b0C. Extracts were separated on an Accucore Vanquish C18 UHPLC column (100 x 2.1 mm; 1.5 \u00b5m particle size), equipped with an Accucore Defender guards pk4 guard column (150 - C18 10 x 2.1 mm, 2.5 \u00b5m particle size) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States). The mobile phase system consisted of a mixture of solvent A, an aqueous solution of 0.1% FA and solvent B, ACN containing 0.1% FA. A gradient elution method was used for the analysis, 0\u20135 min 99% A, 5\u201360 min linear gradient to 1% A, 60\u201389 min 1% A, 89\u2013110 min linear gradient to 99% A and 110\u2013120 min 99% A. A total of 10 \u00b5l of sample were injected with a flowrate of 0.1 ml/min and a 25 \u00b5l loop was used. The column compartment was kept at 30 \u00b0C. Between each measurement a column washing step was performed by injecting a solution composed of (99% water, 1% ACN) + 0.1% FA using the following gradient, 0\u20131 min 99% A, 1\u20132 min linear gradient to 1% A, 2\u201347 min 1% A, 47\u201348 min linear gradient to 99% A and 48\u201368 min 99% A.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Goodacre R, Broadhurst D, Smilde AK, Kristal BS, Baker JD, Beger R et al.

Since the mass accuracy of some m/z features in some of the measurements was higher than 5 ppm, the mass accuracy during peak integration was set at \u00b115 ppm. This was done in order to not lose parts of some peaks that albeit not having a mass accuracy within \u00b15 ppm were consistent in RT and MS2 spectra with the m/z features that were originally selected by having a mass accuracy within \u00b15 ppm.
