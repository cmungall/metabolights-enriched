                "description": "Plants show an extraordinary diversity in chemical composition and are characterized by different functional traits. However, relationships between the foliar primary and specialized metabolism in terms of metabolite numbers and composition as well as links with the leaf economics spectrum have rarely been explored. We investigated these relationships in leaves of 20 woody species from the Mediterranean region grown as saplings in a common garden, using a comparative ecometabolomics approach that included (semi-)polar primary and specialized metabolites. Our analyses revealed significant positive correlations between both the numbers and relative composition of primary and specialized metabolites. The leaf metabolomes were highly species-specific but in addition showed some phylogenetic imprints. Moreover, metabolomes of deciduous species were distinct from those of evergreens. Significant relationships were found between the primary metabolome and nitrogen content and carbon/nitrogen ratio, important traits of the leaf economics spectrum, ranging from acquisitive (mostly deciduous) to conservative (evergreen) leaves. A comprehensive understanding of various leaf traits and their coordination in different plant species may facilitate our understanding of plant functioning in ecosystems. Chemodiversity is thereby an important component of biodiversity.",

                        "description": "<p>We selected 20 woody plant species that are representative of the Mediterranean vegetation and cover a wide range of leaf resource-use strategies. Half of the species are <strong>deciduous</strong>, whereas the other species are <strong>evergreen</strong>. In addition to 2 gymnosperm species of the Pinaceae (PH, <em>Pinus halepensis</em>; PS, <em>Pinus sylvestris</em>), 18 angiosperms belonging to 11 families were included: <em>Buxus sempervirens</em> (BS; Buxaceae), <em>Populus alba</em> and <em>Salix cinerea</em> (PA<em>;</em> SC; Salicaceae), <em>Crataegus monogyna</em> (CM; Rosaceae), <em>Alnus glutinosa</em> and <em>Betula pubescens</em> (AG; BP; Betulaceae), <em>Quercus coccifera</em>, <em>Quercus ilex</em> and <em>Quercus petraea</em> (QC; QI; QP; Fagaceae), <em>Myrtus communis</em> (MC; Myrtaceae), <em>Pistacia lentiscus</em> (PL; Anacardiaceae), <em>Acer campestre</em> and <em>Acer monspessulanum</em> (AC; AM; Sapindaceae), <em>Arbutus unedo</em> (AU; <em>Ericaceae</em>), <em>Fraxinus angustifolia</em> and <em>Phillyrea latifolia</em> (FA; FL; Oleaceae) as well as <em>Sambucus nigra</em> and <em>Viburnum tinus</em> (SN; VT; Adoxaceae). The leaf habits are distributed across taxa and from 3 families (Fagaceae, Oleaceae, Adoxaceae) both <strong>deciduous </strong>and <strong>evergreen </strong>species were chosen.</p><p><br></p><p>Saplings of the 20 woody species (24 individuals per species) were grown in a common garden at the experimental fields of IRTA at Torre Marimon (Caldes de Montbui; <strong>41.613 N, 2.170 E, 176 m a.s.l.</strong>), 30 km north of Barcelona (Catalonia, Spain). The climate is Mediterranean with warm and dry summers and mild winters, with average temperatures ranging from 5 \u00b0C to 27 \u00b0C and an average annual precipitation of 633 mm. Saplings (2-3 years old) were purchased from a tree nursery (Vivers Carex, Cornell\u00e0 del Terri, Spain) to ensure homogeneity in size and growth conditions. In December 2018, individual plants were transplanted to 40 L pots placed on top of upside down plastic trays to keep the pots 5 cm above the ground for better drainage and to avoid direct contact with the soil. Moreover, pots were covered near the base of the stems with mulch to protect the soil from direct sunlight radiation, thus reducing growth of herbs, avoiding warming effects and reducing evaporation.</p><p><br></p><p>Each pot was filled with 30 L of substrate and a 10 L layer of gravel below the substrate to ensure water draining. The substrate (pH = 7) was composed of 23% sand and 77% of a mixture of 2 commercial substrates for Mediterranean plants: BVU substrate (Bur\u00e9s, Girona, Spain) containing fertilizer NPK 15-7-15, <em>Sphagnum</em> peat and ground pine bark as well as J-2 substrate (Bur\u00e9s) containing compost, <em>Sphagnum</em> peat and perlite. Pots were randomly arranged in a ca 1000 m^2 field and subjected to the local environmental conditions including precipitation. Additionally, plants were individually irrigated to field capacity by an automatic dripping system. In early May 2019, pesticides were applied once on <em>Populus alba</em> (Confidor, Bayer, Barcelona, Spain) and on <em>Pistacia lentiscus</em>, <em>Salix cinerea</em> and <em>Quercus ilex</em> (Breaker Max, Certis, Alicante, Spain) due to the presence of insect herbivores. In late May 2019, we selected 6 individuals per species (a total of 120 individuals) that showed no signs of damage by herbivores or pathogens. For each individual we sampled the second youngest expanded leaf or leaves of 1 or several branches corresponding to growth of the current season until enough plant material was obtained for chemical analyses (at least 100 mg fresh mass). Leaves were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, lyophilized and thoroughly ground. Additional leaves of similar age were sampled from the same plant individuals to determine the specific leaf area (SLA).&nbsp;</p>",

                        "description": "<p>The UHPLC-QTOF-MS/MS data were processed in <strong>DataAnalysis v4.4</strong> (Bruker Daltonics). After recalibration of the m/z axis for each sample, metabolic features (each characterized by a specific <em>m/z</em> at a certain retention time) were picked and quantified via their peak heights with the Find Molecular Features algorithm using spectral background subtraction and the following settings: signal-to-noise ratio 3, correlation coefficient threshold 0.75, minimum compound length 20, smoothing width 5. Only features in the retention time range 1.2-29 min were included, thus removing most primary metabolites co-eluting in the injection peak (&lt;1.2 min). Features belonging to the same metabolite (i.e., isotopes, adducts, charge states, fragments based on a H2O loss) were sorted together in so-called buckets (also called compounds). From each bucket, only the feature with the highest intensity was further used. These features were aligned across samples using ProfileAnalysis v2.3 (Bruker Daltonics), allowing shifts of 0.1 min (retention time) and 6 mDa (<em>m/z</em>). Then, peak heights were divided by those of hydrocortisone ([M+HCOOH-H]^- ion) and mefenamic acid ([M-H]^- ion) for gymnosperm and angiosperm species, respectively. Only those buckets were retained in the dataset for which the mean intensity in at least 1 species was more than 50x higher than its mean intensity in the corresponding blanks, which occurred in at least half of the samples of at least 1 species, to focus on compounds representative for these species. Extracts of the used insecticides were measured under the same conditions and all features that occurred in these samples were removed from the dataset. Peak intensities were divided by the sample dry mass. Feature concentrations were expressed on a relative scale, (i.e., a scale ranging from 0 to 1 , with the sum of feature intensities being 1 for each sample) to account for the different internal standards that were used for gymnosperms and angiosperms in the UHPLC-QTOF-MS/MS measurements.</p><p><br></p><p>Statistical analyses were performed in <strong>R 3.6.1 </strong>and <strong>R 3.6.2[1] </strong>using different packages. To visualize sets of metabolic features occurring in certain plant species or combinations of species, UpSet plots were used (package <strong>UpSetR</strong>), showing only intersection sizes of at least 2 and 15 features for the metabolites. A Pearson productmoment correlation test was used to test whether the metabolite richness (i.e., the number of metabolic features per sample) of metabolites correlated. To compare the metabolic composition between samples, non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analyses with Kulczynski distances were performed (package <strong>vegan</strong>), using two dimensions. For these analyses, feature concentrations were expressed on a relative scale, (i.e., a scale ranging from 0 to 1, with the sum of feature intensities being 1 for each sample) to account for the different internal standards that were used for gymnosperms and angiosperms in the UHPLC-QTOF-MS/MS measurements. Wisconsin double standardizations of square-root transformed data were applied. To test whether the metabolome correlated, a Mantel test based on a Spearman rank correlation and Kulczynski distances for both matrices (GC-FID and UHPLC-QTOF-MS/MS) was used. Different leaf traits were plotted as contour lines into the NMDS plots via the ordisurf function (package <strong>vegan</strong>) using generalized additive models (GAM) based on restricted maximum likelihood estimation with Gaussian error distributions, identity link functions and thin plate regression splines. In addition, linear mixed models were used to assess the relationships between NMDS axes scores (as explanatory variables) and leaf traits, including metabolite richnesses, SLA, Cmass, Carea, Nmass, Narea and the C/N ratio. These models included species as a random factor to account for the fact that individuals within a species are likely to be more similar than across species. Models were fit and assessed using the <strong>R </strong>packages <strong>dplyr</strong>, <strong>gamm4</strong>, <strong>ggplot2</strong>, <strong>Ime4</strong>, <strong>ImerTest</strong>, <strong>Matrix </strong>and <strong>MuMln</strong>. Initially, the interactions between NMDS1 and NMDS2 were also tested, but were later on dropped from the models as they were not significant. Some traits (SLA, Carea, Narea, C/N ratio) were log-transformed to meet normality assumptions in linear models.</p><p><br></p><p>Each metabolic feature is characterized by a specific <em>m/z</em> at a certain retention time.
