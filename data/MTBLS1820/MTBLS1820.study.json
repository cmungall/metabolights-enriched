                "description": "<p>Coral reef ecosystems are incredibly diverse marine biomes that rely on nutrient cycling by microorganisms to sustain high productivity in generally oligotrophic regions of the ocean. Understanding the composition of extracellular reef metabolites in seawater, the small organic molecules that serve as the currency for microorganisms, may provide insight into benthic-pelagic coupling as well as the complexity of nutrient cycling in coral reef ecosystems. Jardines de la Reina, Cuba is an ideal environment to examine extracellular metabolites across protected and high-quality reefs. Here, we used metabolic methods to quantify specific known metabolites of interest (targeted approach) and to survey trends in metabolite feature composition (untargeted approach) from surface and reef depth (6 \u2013 14 m) seawater overlying forereefs in Jardines de la Reina. We found that untargeted metabolite feature composition was fairly similar between reef depth and surface seawater across the archipelago, corresponding with other biogeochemical and physicochemical measurements and suggesting that environmental conditions were largely&nbsp;homogenous across forereefs within Jardines de la Reina. Additionally, we quantified 32 of 53 detected metabolites, including amino acids, nucleosides, vitamins, and other metabolic intermediates. Two of the quantified metabolites, riboflavin and 5\u02b9-methylthioadenosine (MTA), displayed interesting trends by depth and geographic location, respectively. Riboflavin concentrations were higher in reef depth compared to surface seawater, suggesting that riboflavin may be produced by reef organisms at depth and degraded in the surface through photochemical oxidation. 5\u02b9-MTA concentrations increased significantly within the central region of the archipelago, displaying biogeographic patterns that warrant further investigation. Here we lay the groundwork for future investigations of variations in metabolite composition across reefs, sources and sinks of reef metabolites, and changes in metabolites over environmental, temporal, and reef health gradients.</p>",

Reef surveys were conducted by scuba divers at all sites using the line-intercept survey method<strong>[1]</strong>. The percent cover of corals, macroalgae, sponges, rock, and sand were recorded on each reef by divers who conducted between 10 and 20 transects (10 m in length) across the reef substrate. In addition to surveying forereefs, we also visited 2 surface 'off reef' sites (800-1600 m depth) to make comparisons between reef and off reef samples.</p><p><br></p><p>At each reef, Conductivity, Temperature, and Depth (CTD) casts were completed (YSI Exo Sonde, Xylem Inc., Yellow Springs, OH, USA) to measure the physicochemical properties (e.g. temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, and pH) of the water column (see File S1 in the paper associated with this study). CTD casts were not completed at the off reef sites. Surface (1 m) and reef depth (1 m off reef; 5-13 m depth) seawater was sampled from 9 JR forereef sites and surface seawater was sampled from 2 off reef sites adjacent to the forereefs (see Fig 1 in the paper associated with this study). Seawater samples collected for cell counts (1 ml) and macronutrient concentration analyses (30 ml for inorganic macronutrient and 40 ml for organic carbon and total nitrogen) were collected from surface and reef depths using a submersible groundwater pump. Additionally, samples collected for chlorophyll a and phaeophytin analysis (4 l) were obtained from off reef and reef depth seawater.</p><p><br></p><p>A scuba diver collected reef depth seawater in an acid-washed, Teflon-lined 8 l Niskin Bottle (General Oceanics, Miami, Florida, USA). Specifically, a diver descended with the Niskin bottle in the cocked position and left the Niskin on a barren part of the reef (i.e. sand patch) for 30-50 min while reef surveys were completed. At the end of each dive, the diver retrieved the Niskin bottle, thoroughly rinsed the Niskin with reef depth seawater, located an area of the reef that was topographically complex (i.e. densely covered with hard and soft corals as well as sponges), and triggered the Niskin to close, capturing reef depth seawater within the Niskin chamber. Upon ascent, the Niskin was immediately placed within a cooler filled with ice. Before leaving the site, surface seawater was collected by hand from the back of the dive boat into acid-washed and autoclaved 2 l polycarbonate bottles (Nalgene, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). For surface reef water collections, 2 acid-washed and autoclaved 2 l polycarbonate bottles were triple-rinsed with surface seawater prior to water collection, samples were collected, and the bottles were filled to the brim and capped. At the 2 off reef sites, surface seawater was collected in duplicate using the same process. Surface samples were stored in the iced cooler until processing. Processing of seawater samples collected for metabolomics was initiated within 1 hr of collection. Samples were collected daily over the course of 2.5 weeks.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Obura DO. Coral reef monitoring manual South-West Indian Ocean islands.

These aliquots of reef depth seawater from the same location were treated as technical duplicate samples during data analyses. Reef depth and surface seawater were filtered separately through polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) 0.2 \u03bcm pore size, 47 mm filters (Omnipore, EMD Millipore Corporation, Billerica, MA, USA) using peristalsis (MasterFlex L/S pump and pump heads, Cole-Parmer, Vernon Hills, IL, USA). TPE tubing and acid-washed fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) tubing (890 Tubing, Nalgene, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) were used to transfer pumped seawater through the filter membrane and into acid-washed and autoclaved polycarbonate collection bottles. Filters were encased in acid-washed and autoclaved 47 mm, perfluoroalkoxy alkane (PFA) in-line filter holders (Advantec, Cole-Parmer, Vernon Hills, Illinois, USA).</p><p><br></p><p>Solid phase extraction (SPE) was performed to concentrate and extract metabolites (e.g. low molecular weight dissolved organic matter) from the filtered seawater using a vacuum manifold (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA). Prior to and after SPE, the bottles were weighed in order to calculate the volume of seawater that passed through the SPE cartridges. The acidified filtrate was then passed through acid-washed FEP tubing and 1 g/6 cc PPL cartridges (BondElut; Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) that were pre-conditioned with 100% HPLC-grade methanol using gentle vacuum pressure<strong>[1][2]</strong>. After filtrate passed through the cartridge, cartridges were removed from the manifold, wrapped with combusted aluminum foil, placed within sterile Whirl-Pak bags (Nasco, Fisher Scientific, Hampton, NH, USA), and frozen at -50\u00b0 C. Wrapped cartridges were shipped frozen to the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and then stored at -80 \u00b0C until the dissolved organic matter (DOM) could be eluted off of the cartridges. To finish the extraction process, cartridges were rinsed with 4 bed-volumes of 0.01 M HCl, dried using gentle vacuum pressure for 5 min, and then eluted into combusted glass vials using 100% methanol (volume of eluents was 6 ml). Methanol extracts were transferred into combusted glass amber vials using combusted glass pipettes, and stored at -20 \u00b0C.</p><p><br></p><p>To prepare the samples for LC-MS analysis, methanol extracts were dried down using a vacuum centrifuge. Dried extracts were re-suspended in 200 \u03bcl of a 95:5 (v/v) MilliQ water:acetonitrile (ACN) solution with deuterated biotin (final concentration 0.05 mg/ml) and vortexed. The extracts were then divided into 3 different preparations: 100 \u03bcl was transferred into a separate analysis vial containing a combusted glass insert for targeted metabolite analysis, 50 \u03bcl was transferred into a combusted 4 ml vial to be used for a 'pooled' sample, and 25 \u03bcl was transferred into a 4 ml vial to be diluted and prepared for the untargeted metabolite analysis. The 'pooled sample' was a combination of aliquots from each sample and was used as a quality control measure during the instrument runs. Untargeted extracts were diluted with 600 \u03bcl of the deuterated biotin standard and water:ACN solution and vortexed. A 100 \u03bcl subsample of this diluted extract was then transferred into an analysis vial and 75 \u03bcl of the dilution was diverted into a 'pooled' sample. Prepared extracts were stored at -20 \u00b0C until they were run on the instruments after 2 weeks of storage.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Fiore CL, Freeman CJ, Kujawinski EB.

The column was washed and re-equilibrated with 1% B (2 min) between injections. Individual autosampler injections (5 \u03bcl each) were taken for negative ion mode analyses. The electrospray voltage was set to 2600 V for negative mode. Settings for source gases were 55 (sheath) and 20 (auxiliary) and these settings are presented in arbitrary units.

The same chromatography column, column conditions, gradient, and flow rates were used for both targeted and untargeted analyses. Autosampler injections of 5 \u03bcl each were made separately for positive and negative modes.

Retention times were then adjusted using Orbiwarp and correspondence between the peaks was conducted. The coefficient of variation across the 8 untargeted pooled sample features was 0.044, demonstrating good agreement between the pooled samples, so these pooled samples were removed from further analyses. Untargeted peak intensities were normalized by dividing the peak intensities by the total sample volume as well as the DOC concentration for each sample. In the untargeted analyses, MS1 features were defined as unique combinations of mass-to-charge ratios (m/z) and retention times (RT). This analysis yielded a table of MS1 features (m/z x RT) and their peak intensities across each sample.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Targeted method:</strong></p><p>The resulting XCalibur raw files (MS/MS data) were then converted into mzML files using msConvert<strong>[2]</strong> and processed with the open-source program MAVEN (v.774)<strong>[3]</strong>.

Environmental concentrations of metabolites were determined by dividing each concentration by the original sample collection volume.
