                "description": "Anthropogenic organofluorine compounds are recalcitrant, globally distributed, and a human health concern. Although rare, natural processes synthesize fluorinated compounds, and some bacteria have evolved mechanisms to metabolize organofluorine compounds. <i>Pseudomonas</i> sp. strain 273 grows with 1-fluorodecane (FD) and 1,10-difluorodecane (DFD) as carbon sources, but inorganic fluoride release was not stoichiometric. Metabolome studies revealed that this bacterium produces fluorinated anabolites and phospholipids. Mass spectrometric fatty acid profiling detected fluorinated long-chain (i.e., C<sub>12</sub>-C<sub>19</sub>) fatty acids in strain 273 cells grown with FD or DFD, and lipidomic profiling determined that 7.5 \u00b1 0.2 and 82.0 \u00b1 1.0% of the total phospholipids in strain 273 grown with FD or DFD, respectively, were fluorinated. The detection of the fluorinated metabolites and macromolecules represents a heretofore unrecognized sink for organofluorine, an observation with consequences for the environmental fate and transport of fluorinated aliphatic compounds.",

The 160 mL glass serum bottles with 50 mL of medium and 110 mL air headspace were closed with butyl rubber stoppers (Bellco Glass Inc., Vineland, NJ, USA) held in place with aluminum crimps. Strain 273 cultures were maintained with different organic substrates including decane, FD or DFD as the sole carbon source. Experiments were initiated with cultures that had been transferred at least 3 times on <strong>the </strong>respective carbon substrate (1% inoculum, v/v). For the metabolite analysis, quadruplicate vessels received the same nominal concentration (7 mM) of different C10 alkanes, including <strong>decane</strong>, <strong>FD </strong>or <strong>DFD</strong>. To ensure sufficient supply of oxygen, the headspace volumes were replaced daily with air. Following a 4-day incubation period, the cells were harvested by centrifugation (8,000 \u00d7 g, 15 min, room temperature) for extraction of FAs and lipids. To test for a possible de novo formation of C-F bonds, cultures were grown with 7 mM (nominal) decane in the presence of 2 mM fluoride. Strain 273 was also grown in medium with 7 mM (nominal) decane as primary substrate and 2 mM MFA. All culture bottles were incubated in upright position at 30 \u00b0C and shaken at 120 rpm.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1] </strong>Xie Y, Chen G, May AL, Yan J, Brown LP, Powers JB, Campagna SR, L\u00f6ffler FE.&nbsp;<em>Pseudomonas</em>&nbsp;sp.

The nitrogen sheath gas was set to a flow rate of 25, with a capillary temperature of 350 \u00b0C. The automated gain control target was set to 3e6. Samples were analyzed with a resolution of 140,000 and a scan window of 120 to 1,800 m/z (mass-to-charge ratio) was used. LightSPLASH LIPIDOMIX (Avanti Polar Lipids) external standards including PC (15:0/18:1), Lyso PC (18:1), PE (15:0/18:1), Lyso PE (18:1), PG (15:0/18:1), PI (15:0/18:1), PS (15:0/18:1), SM (d18:1/18:1), C15 Cer (d18:1/15:0) were used to verify the retention time for each lipid class. If standards were unavailable, the peaks were scanned for across the entire elution gradient. The abundant lipid species detected in the lipidome of strain 273 and the respective mono- and bis-fluorinated analogs were selected for tandem mass spectrometry analysis.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>PRM Phospholipid Detection</strong></p><p>Select lipids were subjected to targeted analysis to determine their fragmentation patterns. The Thermo Scientific Q Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer was operated using parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) in negative mode. Data were collected at a resolution of 17,500, an isolation window of 0.5 m/z, and a normalized collisional energy of 35 with an inclusion list for relevant for all fluorinated forms of PE(34:1) and PG(34:1).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>FAME Detection</strong></p><p>FAME detection used an Exactive Plus Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with an atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) interface<strong>[1]</strong>. The mass spectrometer was operated in positive mode at a resolution of 140,000 scanning from 50 to 750 m/z with an automated gain control target of 3e6 and 100 msec maximum inject time. External standards ranging from C4 to C24 in length were used and [M+H]+, [M\u00b7]+ or [M-CH4O\u00b7]+ ions were identified. Since standards for fluorinated fatty acid methyl esters were not available, expected m/z with 1 or 2 fluorine substitutions were determined and used to identify the respective fluorinated analogs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1] </strong>Powers JB, Campagna SR.
