                "description": "Asari Radix et Rhizoma (ARR) is an important traditional Chinese medicine. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are the main active constituents of ARR. Research on the metabolite profile of VOCs and the difference of absorbed constituents in vivo after an administration of ARR decoction and powder will be helpful to understand the pharmacological activity and safety of ARR. In this study, headspace solid-phase microextraction gas chromatography mass spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC-MS) was applied to profile the VOCs from ARR in rats in vivo. A total of 153 VOCs were tentatively identified; 101 were original constituents of ARR (98 in the powder-treated group and 43 in the decoction-treated group) and 15 were metabolites, and their metabolic reactions were mainly oxidation and reduction, with only two cases of methylation and esterification, and 37 unclassified compounds were identified only in the ARR-treated group. Of the 153 VOCs identified, 131 were reported in rats after oral administration of ARR for the first time, containing 79 original constituents, 15 metabolites, and 37 unclassified compounds. In the powder-treated group, methyleugenol, safrole, 3,5-dimethoxytoluene (3,5-DMT), 2,3,5-trimethoxytoluene (2,3,5-TMT), and 3,4,5-trimethoxytoluene (3,4,5-TMT) were the main absorbed constituents, the relative contents of which were significantly higher compared to the decoction-treated group, especially methyleugenol, safrole, and 3,5-DMT. In the decoction-treated group, 3,4,5-TMT, 2,3,5-TMT, kakuol, and eugenol were the main constituents with a higher content and wider distribution. The results of this study provide a reference for evaluating the efficacy and safety of ARR.",

The roots and rhizomes of the plants were washed and dried in the shade. All samples were identified by Professor Shao-Qing Cai as <em>Asarum heterotropoides Fr. Schmidt var. mandshuricum (Maxim.) Kitag</em>. (AHM). The samples were stored in airtight containers at room temperature. The voucher sample (No. 20140807-1) was deposited in the Herbarium of Pharmacognosy, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Peking University (China).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Decoction of ARR:</strong></p><p>The roots and rhizome of 100 g of AHM (No.20140807-1) were cut into pieces 1 cm in length and put into a decoction pot (4 l; Feilu Waner Electric Co., Ltd., Guangdong, China), and immersed in 800 ml deionized water for 30 min, then boiled for 50 min. 2 layers of gauze filter were used to obtain ARR decoction. Then, 600 ml of deionized water was added to the residue and boiled for 50 min again. The mixed decoction was concentrated to 0.4 g/ml by evaporation in a rotating evaporator (B\u00fcchi B-220, Flawil, Switzerland) at low temperature (&lt;40 \u00b0C). The ARR decoction solution was stored in a refrigerator at \u221280 \u00b0C until use.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Suspension Solution of ARR Powder:</strong></p><p>The roots and rhizome of 100 g of AHM (No. 20140807-1) were pulverized and sieved through 120 mesh (mesh size 125 \u03bcm). The powder was suspended in a 0.4% sodium carboxymethyl cellulose solution to prepare a powder suspension solution of ARR (0.131 g/m). The ARR powder suspension solution should be prepared on the day of administration.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Animals and drug administration:</strong></p><p>18 male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats weighing 250 \u00b1 20 g were randomly divided into 3 groups (6 animals each): powder-treated (group I), decoction-treated (group II), and control (group III). The rats were maintained in metabolic cages (type DXL-DL; Suzhou Fengshi Laboratory Animal Equipment Co. Ltd, Suzhou, China) and acclimatized to the facilities for 5 days prior to experiments. They were housed under standard environmental conditions of temperature at 25 \u00b1 2 \u00b0C and 30%\u201370% humidity under a 12 h light\u2013dark cycle and allowed free access to drinking water and a standard no-residue diet.</p><p><br></p><p>ARR powder was suspended in 0.4% carboxyl methyl cellulose sodium (CMC-Na) solution and orally administered at a dose of 2.0 ml/250 g body weight (group I), ARR decoction was orally administered at a dose of 2.0 ml/250 g body weight (group II), and control group rats were orally administered 0.4% CMC-Na solution at 2.0 ml (group III). All rats were dosed twice per day at a 12 h interval (09:00 and 21:00) for 5 days, and their urine and feces were measured and cleaned up.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Sample collection and preparation:</strong></p><p>Urine and feces samples from rats were collected 1 h after the last administration (on day 5). Urine samples from the same group, 5 ml per rat, were merged into 1 sample and the mixture was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm and 4 \u00b0C for 30 min. Subsequently, a sample solution containing 20% (W/V) NaCl was prepared by adding 0.1 g NaCl to 500 \u03bcl of the supernatant. The sample solution was put in a sample vial and stored in a refrigerator at \u201380 \u00b0C until HS-SPME-GC-MS analysis.</p><p><br></p><p>Feces samples from the same group were merged into 1 sample and weighed. Then, these samples were ground in 4-fold volume (volume/mass wet weight) deionized water and a sample solution containing 20% (w/v) NaCl was prepared by adding 0.1 g NaCl to 500 \u03bcl of the suspension. The sample solution was put in a sample vial and stored in a refrigerator at \u201380 \u00b0C.</p><p><br></p><p>Blood samples were collected in heparinized tubes using a heart puncture technique under anesthesia (10% chloral hydrate, intraperitoneal injection, 0.3 ml/100 g body weight) 1 h after the last administration. Samples from the same group, 1 ml per rat, were merged into 1 sample. A sample solution containing 20% (w/v) NaCl was prepared and stored at \u201380 \u00b0C until analysis.</p><p><br></p><p>After the collection of blood samples, 8 organs (brain, liver, spleen, lungs, kidneys, heart, stomach, and small intestine) of the rats in each group were rapidly removed and flushed with 4 \u00b0C deionized water, dried with filter paper, and weighed. The same organ samples from each group were merged into 1 sample and processed using a homogenizer (T10 Basic ULTRA-TURRAX, IKA, Staufen, Germany) following suspension in a 4-fold volume (volume/mass organ wet weight) of 4 \u00b0C deionized water. Then, a sample solution containing 20% (w/v) NaCl was prepared by adding 0.1 g NaCl to 500 \u03bcl of the suspension.

The optimization of HS\u2013SPME conditions was performed based on our previous research results<strong>[1][2]</strong>, and a SUPELCO DVB/CAR/PDMS fibre (Bellefonte, PA, USA) was selected. Sample vials (10 ml; GL Science, Kyoto, Japan) were incubated at 70 \u00b0C for 5 min prior to microextraction, and the adsorption time was 30 min at 70 \u00b0C. After adsorption, the fibre was withdrawn and transferred into the injection port of the GC. The temperature of the injection port was 230 \u00b0C and the desorption time was 3 min. After the chromatographic run, the fibre was conditioned for 1 min at 250 \u00b0C for the next HS\u2013SPME cycle.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Zhang ZW, Liu GX, Xie DM, Tian F, Jia YK, Xu F, Shang MY, Wang X, Cai SQ.

The NIST 11 library (version 2011; National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) embedded in the GCMSsolution software of the GC-MS workstation (version 2.71; Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) was used for preliminary identification of the mass spectra of the target compounds. The retention index (RI) of chromatographic peaks was calculated for all VOCs using the retention data of linear n-alkanes C7\u2013C30, and the RI values from the literature were also retrieved from the NIST Chemistry WebBook (NIST Standard Reference Database Number 69, <a href='http://webbook.nist.gov/chemistry/' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>http://webbook.nist.gov/chemistry/</a>). Compounds could be identified if the RI calculated from experiments matched the RI retrieved from the NIST Chemistry WebBook. Furthermore, reference compounds were used in the identification by comparing the retention time and mass spectra with the target compounds.</p><p><br></p><p>As stated previously, the identification levels of VOCs in this study were as follows:</p><p><strong>Level 1:</strong> Compounds were identified by comparing their retention time and mass spectra with those of reference compounds.</p><p><strong>Level 2:</strong> Compounds were identified by comparing their RI and mass spectra with those of the literature.</p><p><strong>Level 3:</strong> Compounds were identified by searching mass spectra in NIST 11.</p>",
