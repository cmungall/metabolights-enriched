                "description": "Biotechnology has transformed the production of various chemicals and pharmaceuticals due to its efficient and selective processes, but it is inherently limited by its use of live cells as 'biocatalysts.' Cell-free expression (CFE) systems, which use a protein lysate isolated from whole cells, have the potential to overcome these challenges and broaden the scope of biomanufacturing. Implementation of CFE systems at scale will require determining clear markers of lysate activity and developing supplementation approaches that compensate for potential variability across batches and experimental protocols. Towards this goal, we use metabolomics to relate lysate preparation and performance to metabolic activity. We show that lysate processing affects the metabolite makeup of lysates, and that lysate metabolite levels change over the course of a CFE reaction regardless of whether a target compound is produced. Finally, we use this information to develop ways to standardize lysate activity and to design an improved CFE system.",

                        "description": "<p><strong>Plasmids:</strong></p><p>The plasmids pJL1s70 and pJL1 were used in this study. The plasmid pJL1 was a generous gift from Prof. Michael Jewett and Prof. Julius Lucks at Northwestern University. The plasmid pJL1s70 was constructed by replacing the original T7 promoter of pJL1 with a strong \u03c370 promoter; the original plasmid is hereafter referred to as pJL1t7. The sequences of both plasmids are available in the <strong>Supporting Information</strong> of the publication associated with this study. Plasmids were transformed into E. coli DH10B cells and isolated with Omega midiprep kits according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>CFE Lysate Preparation:</strong></p><p>Cellular lysate for all experiments, excluding toehold switch experiments, was prepared based on previously described protocols<strong>[1]-[3]</strong>. To account for potential variability in the preparation process, 3 batches of each lysate were prepared in parallel, each containing media that was separately prepared and inoculated with individually selected colonies. BL21 cells were grown in either 2x YTP or 2x YTPG media. 2x YTP consisted of 16 g/l tryptone, 10 g/l yeast extract, 5 g/l sodium chloride, 7 g/l potassium phosphate dibasic, and 3 g/l potassium phosphate monobasic and was pH-corrected to 7.2 with Tris. 2x YTPG media consisted of 75% (v/v) 2x YTP and 25% (v/ v) of 7.2% (w/v) dextrose. All media was filter-sterilized prior to use. Cells were grown at 37 \u00b0C and 220 rpm to an OD of 2.0, which corresponds with the midexponential growth phase. Cells were then centrifuged at 2700 rcf and washed 3 times with S30A buffer (14 mM magnesium acetate, 60 mM potassium acetate, 10 mM Tris-acetate (pH 8.2), and 2 mM dithiothreitol). After the final centrifugation, the wet cell mass was determined, and cells were resuspended in 1 ml of S30A buffer per 1 g of wet cell mass. The cellular resuspension was divided into 1 ml aliquots. Cells were lysed using a Q125 Sonicator (Qsonica, Newton, CT) at a frequency of 20 kHz and at 50% of amplitude. Cells were sonicated on ice with 3 cycles of 10 s on, 10 s off, delivering approximately 130 J, at which point the cells appeared visibly lysed. An additional 4 mM of dithiothreitol was added to each tube, and the sonicated mixture was then centrifuged at 12,000 rcf and 4 \u00b0C for 10 min. The supernatant was removed, aliquoted, and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C for future use or subject to a runoff reaction and dialysis. For the runoff reaction, 1 ml aliquots of lysate were incubated in 14 ml round-bottom culture tubes at 37 \u00b0C and 220 rpm for 80 min. After this runoff reaction, the cellular lysate was centrifuged at 12 ,00 rcf and 4 \u00b0C for 10 min. The supernatant was removed and loaded into a 10 kDa MWCO dialysis cassette (Thermo Fisher). Lysate was dialyzed in 1 l of S30B buffer (14 mM magnesium glutamate, 60 mM potassium glutamate, 1 mM dithiothreitol, pH-corrected to 8.2 with Tris) at 4 \u00b0C for 3 h. Dialyzed lysate was removed and centrifuged at 12 000 rcf and 4 \u00b0C for 10 min. The supernatant was removed, aliquoted, and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C for future use. Total protein concentration of each lysate batch was assessed with a Bradford assay.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>CFE reactions:</strong></p><p>Cell-free reactions for all experiments were run as previously described<strong>[4]</strong>. Each cell-free reaction contained 0.85 mM each of GTP, UTP, and CTP, in addition to 1.2 mM ATP, 34 \u03bcg/ml of folinic acid, 170 \u03bcg/ml E. coli tRNA mixture, 130 mM potassium glutamate, 10 mM ammonium glutamate, 12 mM magnesium glutamate, 2 mM each of the 20 standard amino acids, 0.33 mM nicotine adenine dinucleotide (NAD), 0.27 mM coenzyme-A (CoA), 1.5 mM spermidine, 1 mM putrescine, 4 mM sodium oxalate, 33 mM phosphoenol pyruvate (PEP), 27% cell lysate, and 12 nM of the specified plasmid. For each experiment, a fresh aliquot of lysate was used to minimize variability caused by multiple freeze-thaw cycles, and all experiments were performed within 4 months of lysate preparation. When specified, the chemicals putrescine, spermidine, homocysteine, beta-alanine, glucose 6-phosphate disodium salt hydrate, and sodium chloride were added to reactions at the specified concentrations. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma Aldrich.</p><p><br></p><p>For metabolomics analysis, 210 \u03bcl reactions were prepared in 2 ml microcentrifuge tubes. Reactions were run in biological triplicate, with each replicate containing a different batch of lysate. Samples were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for the specified time. 10 \u03bcl of the reaction was then removed and stored at -80 \u00b0C for subsequent fluorescence analysis, and the remaining 200 \u03bcl was stored at -80 \u00b0C for subsequent metabolomics analysis. In experiments solely assessing GFP production, 12 \u03bcl reactions were prepared in PCR tubes and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for the specified time.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Assessment of GFP production:</strong></p><p>To measure fluorescence of CFE reactions, 8 \u03bcl of each reaction was added to a well of a 384 well plate, and the fluorescence was measured with a plate reader (Synergy4, BioTek). Excitation and emission for sfGFP were 485 and 510 nm, respectively.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Silverman AD, Kelley-Loughnane N, Lucks JB, Jewett MC.

Samples were derivatized as previously described<strong>[1][2]</strong>. 10 \u03bcl of 20 mg/ml O-methylhydroxylamine hydrochloride (MP Biomedicals, LLC, Santa Ana, CA, United States) in pyridine was added to each dried sample and shaken at 1400 rpm for 90 min at 30 \u00b0C. 90 \u03bcl of N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA) + 1% trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS) (Thermo Scientific, Lafayette, CO, United States) was then added to the samples and shaken at 1400 rpm for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C. Samples were centrifuged at 21,100 x g for 3 min, and 50 \u03bcl of the supernatant was added to an autosampler vial. Samples were spiked with 0.25 \u03bcl of a retention time standard solution composed of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMES). At the beginning of the GC-MS run, the QCs were injected once and repeated again after every 4-6 sample injections to allow for downstream correction for batch effects. A derivatization blank was prepared and run with every batch of samples.</p><p><br></p><p>A LECO Pegasus 4D instrument with an Agilent 7683B autosampler, Agilent 7890A gas chromatograph,adapted to GCxGC analysis, and time-of-flight mass spectrometer (TOF-MS) was used to analyze the samples. Prior to sample injection, 3 pre-washes were performed with pyridine. Sample was pumped 4 times for thorough mixing and injected using a syringe size of 10 \u03bcl with 1 \u03bcl of injection volume. 3 post-washes of the needle were performed after injection using pyridine. The first column was an HP-5, 28 m long x 0.320 mm ID x 0.25 \u03bcm film thickness (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, United States), and the second was an Rtx-200, 1.7 m long x 0.25 mm ID x 0.25 \u03bcm film thickness (Restek, Bellefonte, PA, United States). Helium was used as the carrier gas with a corrected constant flow rate of 1.00 ml/min. The inlet septum purge flow was maintained at 3 ml/min. The inlet was functioning in splitless mode with a purge flow of 100 ml/min delayed to start 30 seconds after injection, giving a total flow of 101 ml/min. Runs were performed in a gas saver mode with a flow of 20 ml/min set to start a minute after injection. Front inlet temperature was set at 250 \u00b0C for the entire run. The primary oven temperature was held at 70 \u00b0C for 1 min and the temperature was ramped at 10 \u00b0C/min until 315 \u00b0C and held for 2 min. The secondary oven temperature and the modulator temperature offsets were 5 \u00b0C and 15 \u00b0C above the main oven respectively. 1 min equilibration time was set for the ovens. The modulation program is listed in <strong>Table S1</strong> of the paper associated with this study. The transfer line temperature was maintained at 320 \u00b0C for the entire run.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Kind T, Wohlgemuth G, Lee DY, et al.

                        "description": "<p>Sample run output from&nbsp;ChromaTOF (LECO, St. Joseph, MI, United States) was used to determine baseline, peak area, and peak identification as described previously<strong>[1][2]</strong>. Briefly, settings included a baseline offset of 0.5, automatic smoothing, 1st dimension peak width of 36 s, 2nd dimension peak width of 0.10 s, and a match of 700 required to combine peaks with a minimum signal-to-noise (S/N) of 5 for all subpeaks. Peaks were required to have a S/N of 10 and have a minimum similarity score of 800 to NIST, Golm and in-house spectral libraries before assigning a name. Unique mass was used for area and height calculation.</p><p><br></p><p>MetPP was used to align the samples<strong>[3]</strong>. Sample files and a derivatization reagent blank file were uploaded from ChromaTOF. Unknowns were retained during the peak alignment process. The derivatization reagent blank file was used to subtract peaks resulting from the sample preparation reagents from the corresponding sample files. On-the-fly alignment was used with manually selected quality control samples as the peak list for primary alignment. Peak alignment was performed using the default criteria.</p><p><br></p><p>For the T7 and \u03c370 promoter comparison experiment, one of the samples from the group with no plasmid and no T7 RNA polymerase was not properly injected into the GC-MS. For this group, we took the average of the abundances of the two properly injected samples, so there would be 3 samples in the group for downstream analyses.</p><p><br></p><p>To remove analytes that were not reproducibly detected, analytes for which more than half of the values were missing in the QC samples or for which the QC samples had a coefficient of variance larger than 0.5 were removed from the data set. Then, missing values were manually corrected using small value correction only if all the values were missing in the biological replicates.</p><p><br></p><p>After alignment, further processing of the data was done to the samples for the in-depth time course analysis of reactions using lysate NN based on the procedure to remove evident batch effects. First, batch effects were reduced from the data set using LOESS, as previously described<strong>[4]</strong>. The data set was then processed with Combat<strong>[5]</strong> to further remove batch effects that were evident from principal component analysis of the LOESS-corrected data.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, MetaboAnalyst was used for statistical and pathway analysis<strong>[6]</strong>. For both analyses, remaining missing values were k-nearest neighbors (KNN) corrected. Data was filtered using the interquantile range method and then log-transformed using generalized logarithm transformation (base 2) and autoscaled. P-values were adjusted using the Benjamini-Hochberg False Discovery Rate (FDR). Differences were considered significant at FDR-corrected p &lt; 0.05. For pathway analysis, the Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 (KEGG) pathway library was selected using a global test for pathway enrichment analysis and relative-betweenness centrality for pathway topology analysis.</p><p><br></p><p>For the experiment evaluating the effects of metabolite supplementation, the impact of the interaction of metabolites on GFP output was estimated using the Regression tool in the Data Analysis package of Excel.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Dhakshinamoorthy S, Dinh NT, Skolnick J, Styczynski MP.
