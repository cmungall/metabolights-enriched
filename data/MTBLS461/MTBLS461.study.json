                "description": "The marine environment holds one of the largest pools of reduced organic carbon on Earth. Within this organic carbon are metabolites produced as a result of microbial activity. This project considers the effects of predation and viral lysis on the metabolites found in the surface ocean. Using seawater from the surface ocean, we experimentally manipulated levels of predation and viral lysis. At the beginning and end of the experiment, we sampled the intracellular and extracellular metabolites. The extracts were analyzed using liquid chromatography-based targeted and untargeted metabolomics methods that we have modified for use with marine samples. The untargeted metabolomics data revealed a complex mixture of organic compounds in all of the experimental treatments. However, changes in the majority of the features could not be linked to viral lysis or predation. Within the targeted metabolomics data, increased intracellular levels of osmolytes (glycine betaine, dimethylsulfoniopropionate, proline, and ectoine) were observed under conditions with limited grazing or viral lysis. The molecular insights derived here will explicitly inform our understanding of microbial processes in the surface ocean and the subsequent impacts on the global carbon cycle.",

Seawater was collected off the northeastern corner of South America at 9.75\u00ba N, 55.3\u00ba W from 70 m. Silicone tubing was used to collect water from the Niskins and the tubing was placed in the bottom of polycarbonate carboys in order to minimize turbulence during sample collection. The seawater was first filtered through a 0.2 \u00b5m Sterivex (Millipore) to obtain cell-free seawater. To obtain cell- and virus-free seawater, tangential flow filtration using a recirculating Prep/Scale tangential flow ultrafilter (Millipore) with a 30 kDa molecular mass cut-off was used.\n</p>\n5 different experimental treatments were established: 1) a whole seawater control, 2) 20% whole seawater with cell-free seawater, 3) 45% whole seawater with cell-free seawater, 4) 20% whole seawater with cell- and virus-free seawater, 5) 45% whole seawater with cell- and virus-free seawater. There were 3 x 2 l polycarbonate bottles established for each treatment. Each bottle held 2320 ml of fluid. 1 of the bottles was sampled immediately after the experiment was set up. The 2 remaining bottles were incubated for 1 day in an on-deck, flow-through incubator that allowed 10% of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) to pass through its screening.",

Briefly, the filter was extracted 3 times with ice-cold extraction solvent (acetonitrile:methanol:water with 0.1 M formic acid, 40:40:20). The combined extracts were neutralized with ammonium hydroxide and dried in a vacufuge.\n</p>\nThe samples for the targeted mass spectrometry analysis were re-dissolved in 95:5 (v/v) water:acetonitrile and combined with deuterated biotin (final concentration 0.05 \u00b5g/ml) as an internal standard. The final extract volume was 100 \u00b5l.\n</p>\nFor untargeted analysis, the extracts had to undergo an additional de-salting step prior to analysis. Therefore, the dried extracts were re-dissolved in 0.01 M hydrochloric acid and extracted using a 50 mg/1 cc PPL cartridge following a previously established protocol[2]. The resulting methanol extracts were re-dissolved in 95:5 water:acetonitrile and deuterated biotin.\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Rabinowitz JD, Kimball E.
