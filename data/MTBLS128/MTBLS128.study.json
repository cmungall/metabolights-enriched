                "description": "Corynebacterium glutamicum strain ATCC 21831 is a producer of L-arginine that was created by random mutagenesis. It is resistant to the arginine structural analogue canavanine. In order to identify potential bottlenecks in the biosynthetic pathway that leads to this industrially important amino acid, relative metabolite abundances of biosynthetic intermediates were determined in comparison to the type strain ATCC 13032. An extract of U13C-labeled biomass was used as internal standard, to correct for different ionization efficiencies. Metabolites were identified using the ALLocator web platform.",

Cell debris was separated by centrifugation at 20,000 x g at RT for 20 min. Seven hundred microliters of the hydrophilic extracts were transferred into 1.5 ml glass vials and evaporated to complete dryness under a nitrogen stream using a Reacti-Therm III heating/stirring module equipped with a Reacti-Vap III nitrogen evaporator (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA). Samples were dissolved in 50 \u00b5l of water and mixed by vortexing for 10 s. Samples were transferred into 1.5 ml reaction tubes and centrifuged at 20,000 rpm at 4 \u00b0C for 20 min to remove remaining particles. Supernatants were transferred into new 1.5 ml reaction tubes. 13C-labeled extracts were pooled to create a homogenic internal standard. Prior to analysis, a 15 \u00b5l aliquot of each sample was transferred into a 1.5 ml glass vial with inlet (5 mm dia.) and 5 \u00b5l of 13C-labeled internal standard was added. Samples were mixed by vortexing for 5 s and placed into the autosampler.",
