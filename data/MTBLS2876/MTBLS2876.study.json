                "description": "One of the most economically important grapevine diseases is Downy mildew (DM) caused by the oomycete <i>Plasmopara viticola</i>. A strategy to reduce the use of fungicides to compensate for the high susceptibility of <i>V. vinifera</i> is the selection of grapevine varieties showing pathogen-specific resistance. We applied a metabolomics approach to evaluate the metabolic modulation in mono-locus resistant genotypes carrying one locus associated with <i>P. viticola</i> resistance (<i>Rpv</i>) (BC4- <i>Rpv1</i>, Bianca- <i>Rpv3-1</i>, F12P160- <i>Rpv12</i>, Solaris- <i>Rpv10</i>), as well as in pyramided resistant genotypes carrying more than one <i>Rpv</i> (F12P60- <i>Rpv3-1; Rpv12</i> and F12P127- <i>Rpv3-1, Rpv3-3; Rpv10</i>) taking as a reference the susceptible genotype Pinot Noir. In order to understand if different sources of resistance are associated with different degrees of resistance and, implicitly, with different responses to the pathogen, we considered the most important classes of plant metabolite primary compounds, lipids, phenols and volatile organic compounds at 0, 12, 48, and 96 h post-artificial inoculation (hpi). We identified 264 modulated compounds; among these, 22 metabolites were found accumulated in significant quantities in the resistant cultivars compared to Pinot Noir. In mono-locus genotypes, the highest modulation of the metabolites was noticed at 48 and 96 hpi, except for Solaris, that showed a behavior similar to the pyramided genotypes in which the changes started to occur as early as 12 hpi. Bianca, Solaris and F12P60 showed the highest number of interesting compounds accumulated after the artificial infection and with a putative effect against the pathogen. In contrast, Pinot Noir showed a less effective defense response in containing DM growth.",

The mono-locus resistance experiment was conducted in the 2 consecutive years 2016 and 2017; while the pyramided resistance experiment was conducted in the 2 consecutive years 2017 and 2018.

Plants were artificially infected with spores of the pathogen in the greenhouse. The inoculum was collected each year in late spring/early summer from naturally infected plants of the same untreated vineyard (grape cultivar: Pinot Noir) and was characterized by a mix of strains. Grapevine plants were inoculated by spraying the sporangial suspension at the rate of 1 x 10e^6 sporangia/ml on the lower surface of all leaves of plants, whereas the control plants were sprayed using milliQ water. Plants were kept in the greenhouse at a controlled temperature of 21 \u00b0C and over 80% of relative humidity until the sampling. Leaves were sampled at 4 time points following a randomization scheme at 0, 12, 48, and 96 h post-inoculation/mock (see <strong>Fig 1</strong> in the paper associated with this study). 3 biological replicates were sampled at each time point. Each sample was ground under liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until the extractions.</p><p><br></p>",

For the identification of volatile compounds we used letter \u201cA\u201d for compounds with comparable mass spectra and retention time to those of the pure standard, \u201cB\u201d for those with a RI match on a similar phase column with the database <strong>NIST MS Search 2.0</strong>, and \u201cC\u201d for those identified in the mass spectral database <strong>NIST MS Search 2.0</strong>. The experimental linear temperature RI of each compound was calculated using a series of n-alkanes (C10-C30) in the same experimental conditions as the samples.

The transitions and spectrometric parameters were optimized individually for each standard by direct infusion of their solutions (10 \u00b5g/ml) in water/ACN (40:60 v/v) with NH4COOH 10 mM and HCOOH 0.1% into a mass spectrometer at a flow rate of 10 \u03bcl/min. The 2 most abundant fragments to use as quantifier and qualifier were identified for each compound. De-clustering potential (DP) and entrance potential (EP) were optimized for each precursor ion and collision energy (CE) and Collision Cell Exit Potential (CXP) for each product ion. <strong>Table 3</strong>, in the paper associated with this study, shows the compound-specific instrumental parameters used in the analytical method.
