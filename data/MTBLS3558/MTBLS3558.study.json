                "description": "<p><strong>AIM:</strong> Low-molecular-weight organic substances (LMWOSs) are at the nexus between micro-organisms, plant roots, detritus and the soil mineral matrix. The nominal oxidation state of carbon (NOSC) has been suggested as a potential parameter for modelling microbial uptake rates of LMWOSs and the efficiency of carbon incorporation into new biomass.</p><p><strong>METHODS AND RESULTS: </strong>In this study, we assessed the role of compound class and oxidation state on uptake kinetics and substrate-specific carbon use efficiency (SUE) during the growth of three model soil micro-organisms, a fungal isolate (Penicillium spinulosum) and two bacterial isolates (Paraburkholderia solitsugae, and Ralstonia pickettii). Isolates were chosen that spanned a growth rate gradient (0.046-0.316\u2009h-1) in media containing 34 common LMWOSs at realistically low initial concentrations (25 \u03bcM each). Clustered, co-utilization of LMWOSs occurred for all three organisms. Potential trends (p\u2009&lt;\u20090.05) for early utilization of more oxidized substrates were present for the two bacterial isolates (P. solitsugae and R. pickettii), but high variability (R2 &lt;\u20090.15) and a small effect of NOSC indicate these relationships are not useful for prediction. The SUEs of selected substrates ranged from 0.16 to 0.99 and there was no observed relationship between NOSC and SUE.</p><p><strong>CONCLUSION:</strong> Our results do not provide compelling population-level support for NOSC as a predictive tool for either uptake kinetics or the efficiency of use of LMWOS in soil solution.</p><p><strong>SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY:</strong> Metabolic strategies of organisms are likely more important than chemical identity in determining LMWOS cycling in soils. Previous community-level observations may be biased towards fast-responding bacterial community members.</p>",

                        "description": "<p><strong>Microbial isolation and characterization</strong></p><p>All strains were isolated from both field moist Oa and B horizons found under a hemlock-dominated stand in Arnot Forest, New York, USA. A total of 3 microbial strains were chosen from a library originally isolated using soil-extractable, solubilized organic matter (SESOM). All SESOM was derived from the Oa horizon. The extract was created using a modified water extraction<strong>[1]</strong>, involving the suspension of 40 g of field-moist Oa horizon with 200 mL of 18.2 M\u03a9-cm water. Samples were shaken end-to-end for 1 h at room temperature and then left to settle. After 24 h, the solution was sequentially filtered through&nbsp;1.6 \u03bcm GF/A, 0.45 \u03bcm polyethersulfone (PES), and then filter-sterilized using 0.2 \u03bcm PES filters. Enrichment steps were conducted using fresh soil shaken with DI water (1:10 ratio) for 1 h and then left standing for 24 h at room temperature. Enrichments were serially diluted using Winogradsky salts<strong>[2]</strong> and a 100&nbsp;mL sample was then spread onto agar plates (15 g/L) created with SESOM as the sole C-source (denoted 'N') and with the addition of streptomycin and Rose Bengal (denoted 'RB'). All plates were incubated in the dark at room temperature for 3-14 days. Colonies were chosen and re-streaked 3 times before growth was checked in SESOM liquid culture (2x dilution).&nbsp;Further details about the chemical characterization of SESOM and the growth of&nbsp;<em>Paraburkholderia solitsugae </em>in SESOM have previously been reported<strong>[3]</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p>Isolates B3N, B1N and Oa1RB were chosen based on growth rates in defined media and characterized using a combination of genomic approaches. Both bacterial species were identified using genomic DNA as discussed previously<strong>[3]</strong>. Briefly, genomic DNA was extracted from pelleted cells and submitted to the Cornell University Sequencing Facility for sequencing using 3 multiplexed runs of llumina MiSeq Nano (2 x 250 bp). Fungal identification was conducted using ITS1F (CTTGGTCATTTAGAGGAAGTAA) and ITS4 primers (TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC)<strong>[4]</strong>.&nbsp;<em>P. solitsugae</em>&nbsp;was extensively characterized in prior works<strong>[3][5]</strong>. The other two isolates chosen are referred to by the species name with which they have the highest similarity. The genome assembly for strain B1N (<em>P. solitsugae</em>) and strain B3N (referred to hereafter as&nbsp;<em>Ralstonia pickettii</em>) can be accessed via the NCBI portal using the BioProject accession numbers PRJNA590275. The ITS sequence for strain Oa1RB (referred to hereafter as&nbsp;<em>Penicillium spinulosum</em>) can be accessed via the NCBI GenBank portal using accession numbers MZ375756.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Media preparation and culturing conditions</strong></p><p>All experiments were conducted in batch cultures using acid-washed and autoclaved 125 mL Erlenmeyer flasks using 3 biological replicates per treatment. Incubating flasks were maintained at room temperature on a shaker at 150 rpm. Defined media was prepared based on potential carbon substrates utilized by&nbsp;<em>P. solitsugae</em>&nbsp;during growth in SESOM<strong>[3]</strong>. To assess the relative role of NOSC on utilization profiles and use efficiencies of each substrate, all carbon substrates were added to the media at equimolar concentration (25&nbsp;mM each). Substrates included 3 sugars (glucose (glc), galactose (gal), xylose (xyl)), 20 amino acids (alanine (ala), arginine (arg), asparagine (asn), citrulline (cit), cysteine (cys), glutamate (glu), glutamine (gln), glycine (gly), histidine (his), lysine (lys), methionine (met), ornithine (orn), isoleucine (ile), leucine (leu), lysine (lys), phenylalanine (phe), proline (pro), serine (ser), threonine (thr), tryptophan (trp), valine (val)) and 10 organic acids (acetate (ace),&nbsp;a-ketoglutarate (akg), citrate (citrate), formate (form), gluconate (glucon), lactate (lac), malate (mal), oxalate (oxa), pyruvate (pyr), succinate (succ)). The defined medium was filter-sterilized and subsequently supplemented with 1.68 mM NH4Cl, 0.12 mM KH2PO4, 1x Wolfe\u2019s vitamins and 1x Wolfe\u2019s minerals solutions<strong>[6]</strong>, and pH-adjusted to pH 4.5. The nutrient media was prepared in two different manners: (1) with all unlabeled substrates and (2) with single substrate isotopically labeled unlabeled substrates to allow the tracking of labeling into respired CO2&nbsp;and into biomass.</p><p><br></p><p>Species were individually cultured in unlabeled defined media until exponential growth phase and then a sample of this culture was used to inoculate treatment flasks for experimental trials. For trials with bacterial species (<em>R. pickettii,&nbsp;P. solitsugae</em>), this involved overnight culturing and monitoring of growth using optical density at 595 nm (OD595) followed by inoculation of 50 mL treatment flasks with less than a 250&nbsp;mL subsample (theoretical starting OD595&nbsp;~ 0.0005). For trials with&nbsp;<em>P. spinulosum</em>, biomass measurements were made using destructive sampling of biological replicates of starter flasks (n=3 per timepoint), filtration through 0.2&nbsp;mm PES filters and mass determination after drying at 55 \u00b0C for 1 h. At roughly the inflection point of the growth curve, a single flask was sonicated for 5 min and 100&nbsp;mL volumes were used to initiate all treatments. All culturing work was conducted in a laminar flow hood using aseptic technique, sterile filter-pipette tips and with negative controls (n=3) to ensure sterility was maintained.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>For determining substrate utilization profiles, growth trials were conducted solely using the defined media with unlabeled substrates. A growth trial was initiated for each isolate, as described above, with sufficient replicates to allow at least 4 destructive sampling timepoints across the organism\u2019s growth curve. For bacterial species (<em>R. pickettii, P. solitsugae</em>), destructive sampling consisted of centrifugation of ~40 mL of the culture at 10,000 x&nbsp;g&nbsp;for 10 min.&nbsp;Supernatant was decanted and filtered through 0.2&nbsp;mm PES filters. For the fugal species (<em>P. spinulosum</em>), the entire culture of ~50 mL was filtered through 0.2&nbsp;mm PES filters. All samples were immediately allocated into 2 mL centrifuge tubes and stored frozen (-20 \u00b0C) until exometabolomics analysis.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Liebeke M, Br\u00f6zel VS, Hecker M, Lalk M.

After vortexing, samples were buffered to pH 7.0 with an addition of 200 \u00b5L sodium hydrogen phosphate (0.1 mM, pH 7.0) made with 25% D2O (v/v) to provide a lock signal and containing 1 mM of sodium 3-trimethylsilyl-[2,2,3,3,-D4]-1-propionic acid (TMSP). Solutions were transferred to 5 mm NMR glass tubes (length 7 in, Wilmad 'Economy'). Spectral referencing was conducted in reference to the TMSP (final concentration = 0.4 mM).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1] </strong>Hochgr\u00e4fe F, Wolf C, Fuchs S, Liebeke M, Lalk M, Engelmann S, Hecker M.
