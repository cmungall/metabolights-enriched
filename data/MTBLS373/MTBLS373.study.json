                "description": "Many yet undiscovered enzymes still limit our understanding of metabolism. Here, we develop a high-throughput mass spectrometry approach to comprehensively profile proteome-scale protein collections for in vitro enzymatic activity. Overexpressed or purified proteins are incubated in a supplemented metabolome extract containing hundreds of biologically relevant candidate substrates, and accumulating or depleting metabolite ions are determined by nontargeted mass spectrometry. Combining chemometrics and database approaches, we established an automated pipeline for unbiased annotation of novel enzyme functions that was demonstrated to achieve 75% predictive accuracy. In a screen of all 1,275 functionally uncharacterized Escherichia coli proteins, this low false-positive rate discovery method identified 241 potential novel enzymes. Twelve of these were experimentally validated to catalyze 29 diverse metabolic reactions, including the long-elusive multispecific cytidine monophosphate nucleosidase PpnN (YgdH) and the two fumarases FumD (YdhZ) and FumE (YggD). Thus, we establish high-throughput nontargeted in vitro metabolomics and the corresponding hypothesis generation pipeline as an approach for proteome-scale enzyme discovery and assign enzymatic functions to about 20% of the so far uncharacterized E. coli proteins.",

After incubation at 30 \u00b0C for 30 min, lysis was completed by three repeated cycles of freezing (-80 \u00b0C) and thawing (30 \u00b0C). 50 \u03bcl aliquots of the cell lysates were stored at -80 \u00b0C for the cell lysate activity assays. Remaining cell lysates were applied to 96-well format Ni2+-charged nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) affinity columns (GE Healthcare) and washed twice with 20 column volumes of washing buffer (20 mM sodium phosphate, 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, pH 7.5).

We recorded for each purified protein the growth of its expression strain, the concentration of purified protein and whether the solution had a yellow color (see Supplementary Table 3).

All steps of mass spectrometry data processing and analysis were performed with Matlab (The Mathworks, Natick) using functions embedded in the Bioinformatics, Statistics, Database, and Parallel Computing toolboxes as described previously[1]. Briefly, peak detection was done for each sample once on the total profile spectrum obtained by summing all single scans recorded over time and using wavelet decomposition as provided by the Bioinformatics toolbox. In this procedure, we applied a cutoff to filter peaks of less than 500 ion counts (in the summed spectrum) to avoid the detection of artifacts. Centroid lists from samples were then merged into a single matrix by binning the accurate centroid masses within the tolerance given by the instrument resolution (about 0.002 amu at m/z 300). The resulting matrix lists the intensity of each mass peak in each analyzed sample. An accurate common m/z was recalculated with a weighted average of the values obtained from independent centroiding. Because mass axis calibration was applied online during acquisition, no m/z correction was applied during processing to correct for potential drifts. After merging, negatively charged ions were tentatively annotated based on accurate mass using 0.001 Da tolerance (see Supplementary Table 1).\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Fuhrer, T., Heer, D., Begemann, B. and Zamboni, N.

The following isotopes were considered: 12C->13C. The following neutral electrospray adducts were considered: exchange of H to K (H->K), H to Na (H->Na) and addition of sodium chloride (+NaCl). Ions and adducts were chosen based on occurrence frequency determined previously during method development[1] and are tentative in nature. We then correlated the abundance of non-annotated ions with the abundance of annotated ions across all data sets and, in case of a positive correlation (Pearson\u2019s R > 0.8), transferred this annotation. Correlation-based annotation is highlighted by [CORR] in Supplementary Table 2.\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Fuhrer, T., Heer, D., Begemann, B. and Zamboni, N.
