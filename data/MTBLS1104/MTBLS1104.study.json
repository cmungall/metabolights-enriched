                "description": "<p>The development of improved spectrometers and supporting computational tools is expected to eventually enable the rapid annotation of whole metabolomes. However, rarely are novel mass spectrometers directly compared to the previously used ones in the field of metabolomics, thus preventing researchers from gauging the benefits of the investment. LC Orbitrap technology is now widely in use while GC-Orbitrap introduced in 2015 has remained fairly unexplored in its potential for metabolomics research. This study aims to evaluate the additional knowledge gained in a metabolomics experiment when using the GC-Orbitrap in comparison to a unit mass singlequad GC-MS. Samples from an osmotic stress treatment versus a control of the microalga Skeletonema costatum were investigated using comparative metabolomics. Samples from this treatment of a non-model organism were split and measured on both platforms with nearly identical chromatography. Resulting datasets were compared both on a statistical level and on the level of individual compound annotation. Both mass spectrometers successfully classified stressed vs non-stressed microalgae, but the GC-Orbitrap detected more than triple the number of compounds compared to the singlequad mass analyzer, resulting in more readily interpretable annotations. Additionally, one unknown was correctly annotated exploiting high resolution capabilities unavailable to the singlequad mass analyzer. While computational support that specifically utilizes high resolution GC-MS data is still underdeveloped, clear benefits of the GC-Orbitrap technology for metabolomics studies are shown here.</p>",

Batch cultures (400 ml each) with artificial sea water medium<strong>[1</strong>] were inoculated with 8 x 10^6 cells per culture and grown at 13 \u00b0C under a 14/10 h light/dark regime with an illumination of 15-24 \u00b5mol photons/m^2s for 15 days prior to the addition of 50 ml of culture medium. Control cultures received normal additional growth media while the osmotic stress treatment group received culture media enriched with 0.225 g/ml sodium chloride (Carl Roth) giving a salinity of 35 practial salinity units (PSU) in the control group and 60 PSU in the osmotic stress treatment group, respectively. After 27 h, cell densities of all batch cultures were measured by counting under a LEICA DM 2000 light microscope in a Fuchs-Rosenthal counting chamber and cells were extracted. Culture media blanks for both control and treatment conditions were also generated.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Maier I. and Calenberg M.

                        "description": "<p><strong>Identification workflow for every compound consisted of the following steps:</strong> </p><p><strong>A)</strong> Extracted pseudospectra were compared to database spectra using the program MS Search 2.0g (National Institute of Standards and Technology, USA). Databases used were NIST 2011 Mass Spectral Library (National Institute of Standards and Technology, USA), Golm metabolome database[1] version 21.11.2011 and Fiehnlib[2] obtained from MassBank of North America. All matches were manually checked for plausibility because extracted spectra with a low number of peaks can generate high scores even when just very few peaks match to a database spectrum.</p><p><strong>B)</strong> Sum formulas of the most intense and highest m/z ions of compounds putatively annotated in the previous step were calculated using the GC-Orbitrap\u2019s high resolution data and compared to the sum formula of the proposed compound. To exclude false comparisons due to deconvolution artifacts, peaks shapes of all relevant ions were compared to compound peak shapes in the raw data. An annotation was deemed as confirmed by high resolution when each sum formula obtained this way represented the whole or a subset of the proposed compound\u2019s sum formula.</p><p><strong>C)</strong> Molecular ions of remaining unknowns were obtained by CI measurements. Molecular ions were assigned to corresponding EI spectra by searching the CI chromatogram for common fragments and similar sum formulas at the retention index of the compound. Identity as a molecular ion was confirmed by the presence of the adduct series [M\u2212CH3]+, [M+H]+, [M+C2H5]+ and [M+C3H5]+[3]. Extracted high resolution centroided pseudospectra and molecular ion masses when put into MS-FINDER version 3.12. Settings used were the following.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Mass spectrum:</strong> Mass tolerance of 3 ppm in MS1 and MS2 and a relative abundance cutoff of 5%.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Formula finder:</strong> LEWIS and SENIOR checked, element ratio check at 99.7%, element probability checked. Element selection as well as number of TMS and MeOX groups was changed every query depending on preliminary information gained from the high resolution EI spectrum and isotope pattern.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Structure finder:</strong> Tree depth 3, fragmentation library for EI checked, maximum report number 100.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Data source:</strong> all local databases checked, MINE and PubChem always used. Highest scoring structures for each query were subjected to in silico fragmentation via the CFM-ID 2.0 webpage. A structure was considered as a valid annotation if at least one fragmentation pattern (received by either MS-FINDER of CFM-ID) showed similarities to the recorded EI spectrum and a spectral record of the compound did not already exist in the EI databases used. All annotations obtained by this workflow were validated by measuring authentic analytical standards. Compound identity was confirmed by manual comparison of EI accurate mass spectra and matching kovats indices. Instead of retention times for each metabolite, kovats indices are given here.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Kopka J, Schauer N, Krueger S, Birkemeyer C, Usadel B, Bergm\u00fcller E, D\u00f6rmann P, Weckwerth W, Gibon Y, Stitt M, Willmitzer L, Fernie AR, Steinhauser D.
