                "description": "Gram-negative bacteria in the order Rickettsiales are obligate intracellular parasites that cause human diseases such typhus and spotted fever. They have evolved a dependence on essential nutrients and metabolites from the host cell as a consequence of extensive genome streamlining. However, it remains largely unknown which nutrients they require and whether their metabolic dependency can be exploited therapeutically. Here, we describe a genetic rewiring of bacterial isoprenoid biosynthetic pathways in the Rickettsiales that has resulted from reductive genome evolution. We further investigated whether the spotted fever group Rickettsia species Rickettsia parkeri scavenges isoprenoid precursors directly from the host. Using targeted mass spectrometry in uninfected and infected cells, we found decreases in host isoprenoid products and concomitant increases in bacterial isoprenoid metabolites. Additionally, we report that bacterial growth is prohibited by inhibition of the host isoprenoid pathway with the statins class of drugs. We show that growth inhibition correlates with changes in bacterial size and shape that mimic those caused by antibiotics that inhibit peptidoglycan biosynthesis, suggesting statins inhibit cell wall synthesis. Altogether, our results describe an Achilles' heel of obligate intracellular pathogens that can be exploited with host-targeted therapeutics that interfere with metabolic pathways required for bacterial growth.",

Rickettsia parkeri strain Portsmouth was generously provided by Chris Paddock (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). R. parkeri was propagated by infecting monolayers of Vero cells with an MOI 350 = 0.1 of wild-type R. parkeri and growing them at 33\u02daC, 5% CO2 in DMEM plus 2% FBS. Bacteria were purified from infected cells as described previously[1]. Briefly, infected cells were lysed by dounce homogenization in cold K-36 buffer (0.05 M KH2PO4, 0.05 M K2HPO4, pH 7, 100 mM KCl, 15 mM NaCl) to release bacteria, the lysate was overlaid onto 30% MD-76R (Mallinckrodt Inc., 1317-07), centrifuged at 58,300 x g for 20 min at 4 \u00b0C in a SW-28 swinging bucket rotor, and resuspended in cold brain heart infusion (BHI) media (BD Difco, 237500) broth.

Briefly, a 10-\u03bcl aliquot of chloroform sample solution was separated by a Luna reverse-phase C5 column (50 x 4.6 mm, with 5-\u03bcm-diameter particles; Phenomenex) coupled to an Agilent 6430 QQQ mass spectrometer. Mobile phase A was composed of a 95:5 ratio of water/methanol, and mobile phase B consisted of a 2-propanol, methanol, and water in a 60:35:5 ratio. Solvents were modified with 0.1% formic acid and 5 mM ammonium formate. The flow rate for each run started at 0.1 ml/min for 5 min to alleviate backpressure associated with injecting chloroform. The gradient started at 0% B and increased linearly to 100% B over the course of 45 min with a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min, followed by an isocratic gradient of 100% B for 17 min at 0.5 ml/min before equilibrating for 8 min at 0% B with a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. </p><p><br></p><p> Ref:</p><p> [1] Benjamin DI, Cozzo A, Ji X, Roberts LS, Louie SM, Mulvihill MM, Luo K, Nomura DK.
