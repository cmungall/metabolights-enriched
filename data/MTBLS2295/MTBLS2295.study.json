                "description": "Urine is a non-invasive biofluid that is rich in polar metabolites and well-suited for metabolomic epidemiology. However, due to individual variability in health and hydration status, the physiological concentration of urine can differ >15-fold, which can pose major challenges in untargeted LC-MS metabolomics. Although numerous urine normalization methods have been implemented (e.g., creatinine, specific gravity \u2013 SG), most are manual and therefore not practical for population-based studies. To address this issue, we developed a method to measure SG in 96-well-plates using a refractive index detector (RID), which exhibited accuracy within 85-115% and <3.4% precision. Bland-Altman statistics showed a mean deviation of -0.0001 SG units (limits of agreement: -0.0014-0.0011) relative to a hand held refractometer. Using this RID-based SG normalization, we developed an automated LC MS workflow for untargeted urinary metabolomics in 96-well-plate format. The workflow uses positive and negative ionization HILIC chromatography and acquires mass spectra in data independent acquisition (DIA) mode at 3 collision energies. Five technical internal standards (tISs) were used to monitor data quality in each method, all of which demonstrated raw coefficients of variation (CVs) <10% in the quality controls (QCs) and <20% in the samples for a small cohort (n=87 samples, n=22 QCs). Application in a large cohort (n=842 urine samples, n=248 QCs), demonstrated CVQC<5% and CVsamples<16% for 4/5 tISs after signal drift correction by cubic spline regression. The workflow identified >540 urinary metabolites including endogenous and exogenous compounds. This platform is suitable for performing urinary untargeted metabolomic epidemiology and will be useful for applications in population-based molecular phenotyping.",

Stability assessments were performed using pooled urine from all individuals (hereafter referred to as pooled study quality control sample, SQC) as well as internal laboratory reference urine from healthy volunteers (pooled laboratory reference quality control, RQC). All urine samples were stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until assay.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Sample aliquoting and pooled study QC (SQC) sample preparation:</strong></p><p>Urine samples were thawed overnight at 4 \u00b0C, vortexed, and 1.5 ml was transferred to each well of a 2 ml 96-deepwell plate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) placed on a deepwell metal block (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) on ice (instrumentation and materials are listed in <strong>Table S3</strong> of the paper asscociated with this study). An additional aliquot of 1.5 ml of each sample was pooled to create the pooled study quality control (SQC) sample, which was then transferred to the dedicated wells of the deepwell-plate (see <strong>Fig. S1</strong> in the paper associated with this study for the plate layout). To avoid multiple freeze-thaw cycles, the deepwell plate content was directly aliquoted in 15 aliquots of 120 \u00b5l, into 0.2 ml 96-well plates (BMBio, Tokyo, Japan) using a Bravo automated liquid handling platform (Agilent Technologies) equipped with a Peltier 3-position cooling unit (Agilent Technologies) set at 4 \u00b0C using 250 \u00b5l tips (Agilent Technologies). Both deepwell and aliquot plates were sealed with peel aluminium seals (Agilent Technologies) on a PlateLoc thermal microplate sealer (Agilent Technologies) for 2 s at 170 \u00b0C and stored at -80 \u00b0C until use.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Specific gravity (SG) measurement:</strong></p><p>Manual measurements of SG were performed using an UG-D hand-held refractometer (Atago, Tokyo, Japan). 1 aliquot plate was placed on a metal PCR plate insert (Agilent Technologies) for 1 h at 4 \u00b0C for uniform thawing. The plate was then shaken for 10 min at 1600 rpm and 4 \u00b0C in a thermomixer C (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany), centrifuged at 4390 x g in a 7000 plate centrifuge (Kubota, Tokyo, Japan) for 40 min at 4 \u00b0C, and 105 \u00b5l of supernatant was pipetted using the liquid handler to a new 0.2 ml plate and sealed with pierce seals (4titude, Surrey, UK) on a PCR plate sealer (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Samples were equilibrated to room temperature prior to SG measurements. The refractometer was calibrated with high-purity water (see <strong>Table S1</strong> in the paper associated with this study for list and reference of all solvents), wiped with a lint-free tissue after each measurement and re-calibrated after every 20 samples.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Specific gravity (SG) normalization:</strong></p><p>1 aliquot plate was placed on a PCR plate insert for 1 h at 4 \u00b0C for uniform thawing. The plate was then shaken for 10 min at 1600 rpm and 4 \u00b0C in a thermomixer, centrifuged at 4390 x g in a plate centrifuge for 40 min at 4 \u00b0C, and 105 \u00b5l of supernatant was pipetted using the liquid handler to a new 0.2 ml plate. Urine normalization was performed on the liquid handler cooling unit set at 4 \u00b0C. High-purity water was used to dilute urine to a common SG value (1.002) in 0.45 ml 96-well plates (Corning, Corning, NY, USA) on a metal insert (custom-made, see <strong>Table S3</strong> in the paper associated with this study for further details). Normalization was performed using the equation: <strong>volume urine=total volume*(SGtarget-1)/(SGsample-1)</strong>, where the total volume is 340 \u00b5l and the target SG value is 1.002 (lowest normal physiological value). To avoid evaporation during the 2.7 h of the normalization process, aliquot plates and normalized urine plates were covered with slit seals (Biochromato, Fujisawa, Japan).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Um-Bergstr\u00f6m P, Hallberg J, Pourbazargan M, Berggren-Brostr\u00f6m E, Ferrara G, Eriksson MJ, Nyr\u00e9n S, Gao J, Lilja G, Lind\u00e9n A, Wheelock \u00c5M, Mel\u00e9n E, Sk\u00f6ld CM.

Briefly, samples were separated on an Agilent 1290 Infinity II ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) system (Agilent Technologies). The positive mode chromatography was adapted from a previously published methods<strong>[1][2]</strong> using a SeQuant ZIC-HILIC column (100 \u00c5, 100 x 2.1 mm, 3.5 \u03bcm particle size, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) and a gradient between (A) water containing 0.1% formic acid (pH=2.6) and (B) acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid. The separation gradient included an isocratic step at 95% B for 1.5 min followed by a gradient to 40% B in 10.5 min (see <strong>Table S5</strong> in the paper associated with this study for method details). The negative mode chromatography was run on a SeQuant ZIC-pHILIC column (100 \u00c5, 100 x 2.1 mm, 5 \u03bcm, Merck) with (A) ammonium acetate 5 mM in water (pH=9.3) and (B) pure acetonitrile as mobile phases. The gradient was set at 88-60% B from 0-8.5 min and the column oven was heated at 35 \u00b0C (see <strong>Table S5</strong> in the paper associated with this study for method details).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Naz S, Gallart-Ayala H, Reinke SN, Mathon C, Blankley R, Chaleckis R, Wheelock CE.

The MS2 spectra were deconvoluted using <strong>MS2Dec[2]</strong> and <strong>CorrDec[3]</strong>. Identifications were based on in-house compound libraries containing 404 and 295 chemical standards for the <strong>ZHP</strong> and <strong>ZHN</strong> platforms, respectively (see <strong>Table S1</strong> in the paper associated with this study for compound list)<strong>[4][5]</strong>. Metabolites annotated by <strong>MS-DIAL</strong> were further curated using the following criteria: a retention time (RT) shift &lt;0.5 min, a mass shift &lt;10 mDa, and, for spectral match, both a dot product score without weighting above 700 and at least 3 matching MS2 peaks with the reference spectra to avoid spurious high scores from too low number of peaks<strong>[6]</strong>. Any annotations that did not fulfill 1 of the RT or m/z criteria, but were still determined to be accurate received an explanatory comment in the identification tables (<strong>Tables S14</strong> and <strong>S15</strong> in the paper associated with this study). Unidentified peaks, especially features among the 500 most intense peaks, were tentatively annotated using AM (&lt;10 mDa tolerance) corresponding to <strong>MSI level 3</strong>. Supporting information for the annotation of the metabolites was at least 4 matching peaks with in silico fragmentation patterns in <strong>MS-FINDER</strong>, correlation with related compounds in the dataset, previous reporting of the metabolite in urine, RT relative to structurally similar known compounds, presence of specific fragments, etc. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Data curation and filtering:</strong></p><p>All the annotated metabolite peak alignments and integrations were individually curated before exporting as a text file. Peak area and height intensities were plotted across the injection sequence for visual inspection using R '<strong>ggplot2</strong>' scripts. As 1 metabolite can produce several signals (fragments or adducts), the annotated peak list was curated to have only 1 signal per metabolite. The molecular ion ([M+H]+ or [M-H]-) was generally preferred for choosing the representative molecular species; however, in some cases, a fragment or adduct displaying marked improved analytical performances was selected instead. CVs and mean peak intensities were computed for the SQC samples. Missingness (percentage of samples below 5x the blank signal for a given metabolite), skewness, interquartile range (IQR) and D-ratios (percentage ratio of the SQC to sample standard deviations) were calculated in the samples for all annotated metabolites using R scripts.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Tsugawa H, Ikeda K, Takahashi M, Satoh A, Mori Y, Uchino H, Okahashi N, Yamada Y, Tada I et al.
