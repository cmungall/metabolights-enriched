                "description": "<p>Cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (cHABs) dominated by <em>Microcystis aeruginosa</em> threaten the ecological integrity and beneficial uses of lakes globally. In addition to producing hepatotoxic microcystins (MC), <em>M. aeruginosa</em> exudates (MaE) contain various compounds with demonstrated toxicity to aquatic biota. Previously, we found that the ecotoxicity of MaE differed between MC-producing and MC-free strains at exponential (E-phase) and stationary (S-phase) growth phases. However, the components in these exudates and their specific harmful effects were unclear. In this study, we performed untargeted metabolomics based on liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to reveal the constituents in MaE of a MC-producing and a MC-free strain at both E-phase and S-phase. A total of 409 metabolites were identified and quantified based on their relative abundance. These compounds included lipids, organoheterocyclic compounds, organic acid, benzenoids and organic oxygen compounds. Multivariate analysis revealed that strains and growth phases significantly influenced the metabolite profile. The MC-producing strain had greater total metabolites abundance than the MC-free strain at S-phase, whereas the MC-free strain released higher concentrations of benzenoids, lipids, organic oxygen, organic nitrogen and organoheterocyclic compounds than the MC-producing strain at E-phase. Total metabolites had higher abundance in S-phase than in E- phase in both strains. Analysis of differential metabolites (DMs) and pathways suggest that lipids metabolism and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites were more tightly coupled to growth phases than to strains. Abundance of some toxic lipids and benzenoids DMs were significantly higher in the MC-free strain than the MC-producing one. This study builds on the understanding of MaE chemicals and their biotoxicity, and adds to evidence that non-MC-producing strains of cyanobacteria may also pose a threat to ecosystem health.</p>",

The 2 strains originated from Dianchi Lake, which is located in Kunming, China. Dianchi Lake is a hypereutrophic plateau lake heavily impacted by cHABs<strong>[1][2]</strong>. Strains were grown in a modified HGZ-145 medium at 25 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C at 50 \u03bcmol quanta m-2 s-1, with a 12:12 h light:dark cycle, and gently mixed twice daily by hand<strong>[3]</strong>. Strains were cultured in 1000 mL of nutrient solution in 2000 mL Erlenmeyer flasks with 6 biological replicates. Initial inoculation density was 2.0 x 10^6 cells/mL. And 1 mL of each culture was collected under aseptic conditions daily in order to develop a growth curve and identify cell growth phase based on cell density. Culture approaches adopted principles of sterile technique and routine microscopic examination to verify the low abundance of heterotrophic microbiome<strong>[4][5]</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Experimental design and sample collection</strong></p><p><em>M. aeruginosa</em> cells were counted daily using a hemocytometer and an optical microscope (Olympus, BX51, Japan). E-phase and S-phase cultures of both strains were harvested on days 3 and 35 for MaE analysis. To obtain MaE, cultures were clarified by centrifugation at 6000 x g for 10 min following which supernatant was filtered through a 0.22 \u03bcm glass fiber filter (MiLiMo separation technology limited company, Shanghai, China). After filtration, MaE was flash-frozen using liquid nitrogen, and all samples stored at -80 \u00b0C for subsequent metabolomics analysis<strong>[6]</strong>. We found the cells remained intact under the microscope at two growth stages, and no turbidity was observed in extracellular exudate during centrifugation. Hereafter, we refer to MaE of the MC-producing strain collected at E- and S-phases as MCE and MCS, respectively, while that of the MC-free strain are MCFE and MCFS, respectively.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1] </strong>Liu J, Luo X, Zhang N, Wu Y.
