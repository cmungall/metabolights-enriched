                "description": "<h4><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> Multiple myeloma is characterized by clonal proliferation of malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow that produce monoclonal immunoglobulins. N-glycosylation changes of these monoclonal immunoglobulins have been reported in multiple myeloma, but previous studies only detected limited serum N-glycan features.</h4><h4><strong>METHODS:</strong> Here, a more detailed study of the human serum N-glycome of 91 multiple myeloma patients and 51 controls was performed. We additionally analyzed sequential samples from patients (n\u202f=\u202f7) which were obtained at different time points during disease development as well as 16 paired blood serum and bone marrow plasma samples. N-glycans were enzymatically released and measured by mass spectrometry after linkage specific derivatization of sialic acids.</h4><h4><strong>RESULTS:</strong> A decrease in both \u03b12,3- and \u03b12,6-sialylation, galactosylation and an increase in fucosylation within complex-type N-glycans were found in multiple myeloma patients compared to controls, as well as a decrease in difucosylation of diantennary glycans. The observed glycosylation changes were present in all ISS stages, including the 'low-risk' ISS I. In individual patients, difucosylation of diantennary glycans decreased with development of the disease. Protein N-glycosylation features from blood and bone marrow showed strong correlation. Moreover, associations of monoclonal immunoglobulin (M-protein) and albumin levels with glycan traits were discovered in multiple myeloma patients.</h4><h4><strong>CONCLUSIONS &amp; GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: </strong>In conclusion, serum protein N-glycosylation analysis could successfully distinguish multiple myeloma from healthy controls. Further studies are needed to assess the potential roles of glycan trait changes and the associations of glycans with clinical parameters in multiple myeloma early detection and prognosis.</h4>",

For the longitudinal samples, between 2 and 5 serum samples for each patient were collected at different time points during disease progression. In addition, 51 serum samples from age- and sex-matched healthy individuals were used as controls. All samples were obtained after informed consent, and the study was approved by the regional ethics committee (<strong>REK 2011/2029</strong> and <strong>2012/2033</strong>).

N-glycans were enzymatically released from all serum and BM plasma glycoproteins. Subsequently, glycans were derivatized by ethyl esterification and purified using hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC)-solid phase extraction (SPE).</p><p><br></p><p>N-glycans were enzymatically released from serum and BM plasma proteins using recombinant PNGase F as previously described<strong>[1]</strong>. Briefly, 5 \u03bcl of serum or BM plasma of each sample was first denatured by adding 10 \u03bcl of 2% SDS and 10 min incubation at 60 \u00b0C. The release step was performed by the addition of 10.5 \u03bcl of release mixture (4% NP-40:5 x PBS, 1:1) containing 1 U PNGase F, followed by overnight incubation at 37 \u00b0C.</p><p><br></p><p>The released N-glycans were derivatized employing the recently developed linkage-specific sialic acid stabilization method as reported previously<strong>[2]</strong>. In short, 1 \u03bcl of released glycans was added to 20 \u03bcl of derivatization mixture containing 250 mM EDC and 250 mM HOBt in pure ethanol and the mixture was incubated for 60 min at 37 \u00b0C, followed by adding 20 \u03bcl of ACN and 15 min further incubation at -20 \u00b0C before the glycan purification.</p><p><br></p><p>Glycans were enriched and purified from the derivatized mixture by HILIC-SPE using cotton thread as the stationary phase packed in the pipette tips<strong>[2][3]</strong>. The cotton tips were pre-conditioned with 3 x 20 \u03bcl of MQ water, followed by equilibration with 3 x 20 \u03bcl of 85% ACN. Then, the sample was loaded by pipetting the derivatized glycan mixture 20x extensively, followed by the washing steps consisting of 3 x 20 \u03bcl of 85% ACN + 1% TFA and 3 x 20 \u03bcl of 85% ACN. Glycans were finally eluted in 10 \u03bcl of MQ water.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Ruhaak LR, Huhn C, Waterreus WJ, de Boer AR, Neus\u00fcss C, Hokke CH, Deelder AM, Wuhrer M.

Briefly, using <strong>FlexAnalysis software</strong> (version 3.3 build 65, Bruker Daltonics), acquired MALDI-TOF-MS spectra were smoothed, baseline corrected, transformed to .XY format by batch processing function and then exported. Using the in-house developed software MassyTools (version 0.1.8.1.2), transformed .XY profiles of the cohort were calibrated using the calibrants listed in <strong>Table S1</strong> of the paper associated with the study, (minimum 5 calibrants at signal to noise ratio (S/N) &gt; 9). During this step, 30 spectra were excluded (blank samples). Next, sum spectra were separately generated for all biological groups (MM, BM plasma, longitudinal samples and healthy controls) as well as quality control samples using an in-house developed Python script (Python Software Foundation; <a href='http://docs.python.org/py3k/reference/index.html)' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>http://docs.python.org/py3k/reference/index.html)</a>, resulting in sum spectra for each group, from which a composition list for targeted data extraction was generated. For this, all mono-isotopic peaks with S/N &gt; 3 and relative intensity &gt; 0.1% compared to the base peak as well as good isotopic pattern were included in the composition list. Of these peaks, 120 peaks were manually assigned to glycan compositions using the GlycoPeak finder tool (<a href='http://www.eurocarbdb.org/ms-tools/' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>http://www.eurocarbdb.org/ms-tools/</a>)<strong>[2]</strong> as well as previously reported and confirmed glycan compositions<strong>[1]</strong>. Using this composition list, the intensities for the putative glycan structures were extracted as background-corrected area for each spectrum of the samples using Massy-Tools, along with spectral and analyte quality control parameters<strong>[3]</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p>Further processing and curation of the extracted data from <strong>MassyTools</strong> were preceded in Microsoft Excel 2010. Only spectra with quality control values of 'fraction of analyte area S/N &gt; 9' and with the lower cut-off &gt; 3X, the standard deviation (SD) of the mean, were included for further analysis. For the analyte curation, only glycan signals that were present in at least 40% of the spectra of either MM patients or healthy controls were included in the&nbsp;nal calculations of relative abundances and the glycosylation traits. The presence of a glycan was de ned as S/N &gt; 9, ppm error &lt; 20, and QC score &lt; 25%. 3 biological samples and 1 VisuCon standard sample were excluded during the curation. After curation, 79 glycan compositions out of the 120 compositions and 250 spectra out of the 284 raw spectra remained for analysis. Finally, the sum of glycan areas per spectrum was rescaled to 100% to assess relative intensities.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Reiding KR, Blank D, Kuijper DM, Deelder AM, Wuhrer M.

                        "description": "<p>Glycan compositions were assigned on the basis of literature and known biosynthetic pathways, see <strong>Table S2</strong> in the paper associated with this study. Directly detected glycan compositions were grouped into derived glycan traits. The formulas used for calculation of the derived traits are given in <strong>Table S3</strong> in the paper associated with this study, and calculations were performed in <strong>RStudio 0.98.1091</strong> (RStudio Team, Boston, MA, <a href='http://www.R-project.org/' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>http://www.R-project.org/</a>)<strong>[1]</strong>. Glycans were grouped into derived traits based on their structural characteristics as well as to reflect biosynthetic steps: the glycan types (high-mannose-, hybrid- and complex-type glycans), the number of antennae (A), and other features such as bisection (B), galactosylation (G), fucosylation (F), and (linkage-specific) sialylation (S) The first set of derived traits partitioned all glycans into high-mannose-, complex and hybrid-type glycans. Complex-type glycans were further subdivided and analyzed according to the number of antennae, fucosylation, galactosylation and sialylation. Antenna and fucosylation traits were calculated by summing the relative intensities of the selected glycans. Derived traits indicate that glycan alterations are shared by a panel of structurally related glycans<strong>[2]-[4]</strong>. The subject of the calculation is represented by the last letter, e.g., sialylation (S), and the group on which it is calculated by the preceding letters, e.g., triantennary fucosylated species (A2F). This, for instance, translates A2FGS into the sialylation per galactose within diantennary fucosylated species. Notably, the derived traits have previously been reported to show higher repeatability than the individual traits from which they were calculated<strong>[5]</strong>. Raw data files of direct and derived glycan traits for all the samples measured in this study are provided in <strong>Table S4</strong> in the paper associated with this study. Data quality was assessed by the inclusion of a standard sample (<strong>VisuCon</strong> plasma) and calculating the mean, SD, and the relative SD (coefficient of variation, CV) for all glycans (see <strong>Table S5</strong> in the paper associated with this study). Differences between the biological groups and associations between sample matrices as well as associations with clinical parameters were assessed using statistical test and packages in <strong>RStudio 0.98.1091</strong> (RStudio Team, Boston, MA)<strong>[1]</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Statistical rationale:</strong></p><p>MALDI-TOF MS was used for identification and relative quantification of the purified glycans for each sample. Data quality was assessed by the standard sample (<strong>VisuCon</strong> plasma). Derived glycosylation traits were calculated from the single glycans detected. Direct and derived N-glycan traits were compared between MM and controls using the non-parametric <strong>Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon</strong> test since data were not normally distributed. Bonferroni correction for multiple testing was used to adjust the significance threshold. The differences and correlations of glycan traits between paired BM plasma and blood from the same MM patients were assessed by paired t-test and linear regression. The associations between glycan traits and stages were analyzed by logistic regression to investigate their relevance and the values for predicting disease progression and prognosis. The associations of clinical parameters with glycan traits were carried out by regression analysis.
