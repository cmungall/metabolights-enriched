                "description": "Lung cancer remains the most common cause of cancer deaths worldwide, yet there is currently a lack of diagnostic noninvasive biomarkers that could guide treatment decisions. Small molecules (<1500 Da) were measured in urine collected from 469 lung cancer patients and 536 population controls using unbiased liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Clinical putative diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers were validated by quantitation and normalized to creatinine levels at two different time points and further validated in an independent sample set, which comprises 80 cases and 78 population controls, with similar demographic and clinical characteristics when compared to the training set. Creatine riboside (IUPAC name: 2-{2-[(2R,3R,4S,5R)-3,4-dihydroxy-5-(hydroxymethyl)-oxolan-2-yl]-1-methylcarbamimidamido}acetic acid), a novel molecule identified in this study, and N-acetylneuraminic acid (NANA), were each significantly (P <0.00001) elevated in non\u2013small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and associated with worse prognosis (hazard ratio (HR) =1.81 [P =0.0002], and 1.54 [P =0.025], respectively). Creatine riboside was the strongest classifier of lung cancer status in all and stage I\u2013II cases, important for early detection, and also associated with worse prognosis in stage I\u2013II lung cancer (HR =1.71, P =0.048). All measurements were highly reproducible with intraclass correlation coefficients ranging from 0.82 \u2013 0.99. Both metabolites were significantly (P <0.03) enriched in tumor tissue compared to adjacent non-tumor tissue (N =48), thus revealing their direct association with tumor metabolism. Creatine riboside and NANA may be robust urinary clinical metabolomic markers that are elevated in tumor tissue and associated with early lung cancer diagnosis and worse prognosis.",

All subsequent data analyses were performed using R, a freely available language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. The R package XCMS2, version 1.22.1, was utilized to extract and align peaks for all detected metabolites. Peak areas for all signals were extracted using the following criteria: ppm=25, mzdiff=-0.005, snthresh = 10, scanrange=c(1,500), peakwidth=c(5,12), prefilter=c(1,30)). Retention times were aligned using one iteration of the rector() function using the loess method, which performs smoothing of the retention time deviations for every time point in each sample. Peaks were then found using the group() function with the following parameters: bw=10, minfrac=0.1, mzwid=0.01. Next, ESI+ and ESI- signals were merged on lung cancer cases and healthy control samples that were in common between both sets (N = 1257) and signals with masses that had a ppm error larger than 50 were removed from further analysis. This filtering reduced the total number of signals from 2756 and 1804 to 1807 and 1359, for ESI+ and ESI- modes, respectively. Next, a normalization algorithm analogous to MSTUS (MS 'total useful signal')3 normalization was applied. Signals that are putative xenobiotics (e.g., acetaminophen) were removed before calculating the scaling factor using the following criteria: signals with very high abundance (> 90th percentile) in at most 100 samples and with very low abundance (<= 20th percentile) in at least 800 samples. Scaling factors, total intensity counts for each sample divided by the mean total intensity counts of all samples, were then used to normalize signal abundances. Finally, signals with variation (measured by coefficients of variation) between duplicates higher than variations between randomly selected sample pairs were removed.",
