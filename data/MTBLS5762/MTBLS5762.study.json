                "description": "<p><em>Bordetella pertussis</em> is the bacterial causative agent of whooping cough, a serious respiratory illness. An extensive knowledge on its virulence regulation and metabolism is a key factor to ensure pertussis vaccine manufacturing process robustness. The aim of this study was to refine our comprehension of <em>B. pertussis</em> physiology during <em>in vitro</em> cultures in bioreactors. A longitudinal multi-omics analysis was carried out over 26 h small-scale cultures of <em>B. pertussis</em>. Cultures were performed in batch mode and under culture conditions intending to mimic industrial processes. Putative cysteine and proline starvations were, respectively, observed at the beginning of the exponential phase (from 4 to 8 h) and during the exponential phase (18 h 45 min). As revealed by multi-omics analyses, the proline starvation induced major molecular changes, including a transient metabolism with internal stock consumption. In the meantime, growth and specific total PT, PRN and Fim2 antigen productions were negatively affected. Interestingly, the master virulence-regulating two-component system of <em>B. pertussis</em> (BvgASR) was not evidenced as the sole virulence regulator in this <em>in vitro</em> growth condition. Indeed, novel intermediate regulators were identified as putatively involved in the expression of some virulence-activated genes (vags). Such longitudinal multi-omics analysis applied to <em>B. pertussis</em> culture process emerges as a powerful tool for characterization and incremental optimization of vaccine antigen production.</p>",

                        "description": "<p><strong>Bacterial strain</strong></p><p>A colony of <em>B. pertussis</em> Tohama I (ATCC BAA-589) was isolated from a lyophilized commercial stock solution cultured on a Bordet Gengou agar (BD, 254400) plate. From this colony, a master seed bank was obtained using a 48 h cultivation on Bordet Gengou agar plate and aliquoted in Bovine Serum Albumin-Saccharose Phosphate Glutamate buffer. A working seed bank was next produced from the master seed bank cultured using a chemically defined SS-medium in a fermenter. The culture was then harvested in exponential growth phase and aliquoted following the addition of 20% of glycerol and stored at -80 \u00b0C.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Bacterial culture</strong></p><p>In total 6 batch cultures of Bordetella pertussis, strain Tohama I (ATCC BAA-589), were performed in a chemically defined medium derived from the Stainer-Scholte medium as previously described<strong>[1]</strong>. This medium reproduces the composition of casein hydrolysate-containing medium used in industrial processes<strong>[2][3]</strong>. Preculture and cultures were carried out in small scale biofermenters (Ambr 250, Sartorius), in a batch mode at 36 \u00b0C, pH 7.3, and 26% of dissolved oxygen (DO). Anti-foam C (Dow Corning) was used to control foaming and pH was regulated by automatic addition of 10% (v/v) H3PO4. Dissolved oxygen was controlled by a regulation cascade of stirring (350-1300 rpm), air injection (10-110 mL/min) and dioxygen injection (0-80 mL/min).</p><p><br></p><p>Briefly, preculture was inoculated from the frozen working seed bank. After 22 h of growth, an appropriate volume of preculture was centrifuged to replace preculture supernatant with fresh medium. Fermenters were inoculated at 0.1 of optical density at 650 nm wavelength (OD650). Sampling was performed for quality control (QC) testing, antigen quantification and omics analyses. End of the cultures were determined by a sudden decrease of carbon emission rate (CER) and an increase of dissolved oxygen.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Sampling methods for multi-omics analyses</strong></p><p>A total of 6 batch cultures were used in this study - 3 of the 6 cultures were used to collect samples after 1 h of culture. Due to the low level of biomass at the beginning of the culture, large volumes of the bacterial cultures had to be collected to allow multi-omics analyses. Thus, to prevent a bias due to a change of the culture conditions in the subsequent time points, those 3 bioreactors were stopped. The 3 remaining bioreactors were sampled after 4, 8 and 12 h, 18 h 45 min, and 22 and 26 h of culture for all omics analyses.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Lipidomics (LC-MS)</strong></p><p>For<strong> </strong>lipidomic analyses, 4 ODu were sampled and mixed with 50% (v/v) of quenching solution (40% ethanol/0.8% NaCl at -25 \u00b0C)<strong>[4][5]</strong>.Then, samples were immediately centrifuged for 10&nbsp;min at 4000&nbsp;x g and 4 \u00b0C and supernatants were eliminated. Samples were immediately frozen in dry ice and stored at -80&nbsp;\u00b0C until analysis.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Metabolomics (NMR)</strong></p><p>For extracellular metabolomic analyses, at least 300&nbsp;\u00b5L were sampled, centrifuged for 10&nbsp;min at 4000&nbsp;x g at 4&nbsp;\u00b0C and supernatants were collected. Samples were immediately frozen in dry ice and stored at -80&nbsp;\u00b0C until analysis.</p><p><br></p><p>A longitudinal multi-omics analysis was carried out over a 26 h small-scale fermentation of <em>B. pertussis</em>.

Briefly, 700&nbsp;\u00b5L of the mix chloroform (CHCl3)/methanol (MeOH) at the ratio 1/2 (v/v) were added to pellets. Samples were homogenized by pipetting, transferred in 2&nbsp;mL vials containing the lysing matrix B (MP Biomedicals) and lysed by beads beating using the Precellys Evolution homogenizer (Bertin Technologies) (3&nbsp;x&nbsp;40&nbsp;s, 6500&nbsp;rpm, 4&nbsp;\u00b0C, pause of 30&nbsp;s). Then, samples were incubated in a thermoshaker (Eppendorf) for 10&nbsp;min at 1600&nbsp;rpm and 4&nbsp;\u00b0C and centrifuged for 3&nbsp;min at 10,000 x&nbsp;g and 4&nbsp;\u00b0C. For each sample, 500&nbsp;\u00b5L of supernatants were isolated. The extraction was repeated 2 more times with 700&nbsp;\u00b5L of the mix CHCl3/MeOH/H2O at the ratio 1/2/0.8 (v/v), and 2 x&nbsp;700&nbsp;\u00b5L of supernatants were isolated. Aqueous and organic phases were separated by addition of 500&nbsp;\u00b5L of H2O and CHCl3, mixed by vortexing and then centrifuged for 5&nbsp;min at 2500 x&nbsp;g at room temperature to accelerate phase separation. Organic phase was isolated (1000&nbsp;\u00b5L), and 800&nbsp;\u00b5L of CHCl3 was added to repeat organic extraction. Samples were mixed, centrifuged and organic phase was isolated (800&nbsp;\u00b5L). Then, solvents were evaporated under nitrogen flow at 40 \u00b0C using the Stuart evaporator for 1&nbsp;h. Dried samples were stored at -20 \u00b0C waiting analysis. As a control, blank samples without biological materials were also prepared using the same preparation protocol. Lipids were dissolved in 200&nbsp;\u00b5L of isopropanol (IPA) containing an internal standard (IS) and incubated for 10&nbsp;min at 1600&nbsp;rpm and 10&nbsp;\u00b0C. This IS is composed of 1 \u00b5g/mL of lyso-phosphatidylethanolamine (lyso-PE; 17:0), arachidonic acid (C20:4 D8), PE (C16:0 D31/18:1), phosphatidylglycerol (PG; C16:0 D31/18:1), phosphatidylcholine (PC; C14:0 /14:0 D54) and Ceramide (16:0 D31) in IPA. Then, 25&nbsp;\u00b5L of each sample were pooled to obtain QC samples and the rest of the samples was transferred in HPLC vial inserts for LC-MS analysis. IPA and IPA with IS were used as blank for LC-MS analysis.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Metabolomics (NMR)</strong></p><p>Supernatant, containing extracellular metabolites, thawed at room temperature were vortexed and 250&nbsp;\u00b5L of samples were filtered using 0.2&nbsp;\u00b5m centrifugal filter units (VWR) (for 5&nbsp;min at 10,000&nbsp;x g and 4&nbsp;\u00b0C).

The coefficient of variation (CV = standard deviation/mean) of features was computed to assess the analytical stability of the features. Features with a CV greater than 30% in QC samples were removed from the data because they were considered as analytically inconsistent.
