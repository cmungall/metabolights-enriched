                "description": "<p>Residues from ancient artifacts can help identify which plant species were used for their psychoactive properties, providing important information regarding the deep-time co-evolutionary relationship between plants and humans. However, relying on the presence or absence of one or several biomarkers has limited the ability to confidently connect residues to particular plants. We describe a comprehensive metabolomics-based approach that can distinguish closely related species and provide greater confidence in species use determinations. An approximately 1430-year-old pipe from central Washington State not only contained nicotine, but also had strong evidence for the smoking of <em>Nicotiana quadrivalvis</em> and <em>Rhus glabra</em>, as opposed to several other species in this pre-contact pipe. Analysis of a post-contact pipe suggested use of different plants, including the introduced trade tobacco, <em>Nicotiana rustica</em>. Ancient residue metabolomics provides a new frontier in archaeo-chemistry, with greater precision to investigate the evolution of drug use and similar plant-human co-evolutionary dynamics.</p>",

Lights were set for 16/8 hr (day/night) and to come on when the outside light intensity fell below 200 \u00b5mol m-2 s-1. Light intensity readings averaged 350\u2013400 \u00b5mol m-2 s-1 in the greenhouse during the day.

Vouchers specimens collected by Korey Brownstein were filed in the Marion Ownbey Herbarium, Washington State University, Pullman, WA, USA and can be found by performing a person search in the following database: herbaria.wsu.edu/web/personSearch.aspx. The commonly associated biomarkers of each smoke plant were determined by searching the database, KNApSAcK.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Smoking of Experimental Pipes</strong></p><p>After collecting <em>A. uva-ursi</em> leaves, <em>C. sericea</em> bark, <em>N. attenuata</em> leaves, <em>N. quadrivalvis</em> leaves, <em>N. rustica</em> leaves, <em>N. tabacum</em> leaves, <em>R. glabra</em> autumn leaves, and <em>T. brevifolia</em> needles, they were freeze-dried for 3 days and crushed for experimental smoking. The plant tissues were smoked in the Tushingham Ancient Residue Lab (TARL). Commercially distributed clay pipes (Sanctuary Traders, Tinley Park, IL, USA) were used to guarantee uniformity in terms of design, firing temperatures, and clay composition. The dimensions of the experimental pipes were as follows\u2014bowl diameter: 1.5 cm, bowl depth: 2.0 cm, stem length: 9.5 cm, and total length: 11.0 cm. The pipes were inserted into a vice and connected to catheter tip disposable syringes by adjustable rubber tubing. Plant tissues\u2014either leaves, needles, or bark shavings\u2014were lit using commercial butane gas stove lighters. To prevent any harm to research personnel, the experiment was performed in a fume hood.</p><p><br></p><p>For the five experimental pipe replicates of each plant species, five full bowls (dried weights ranged between 87.50 and 256.90 mg) were smoked in the same pipe. After smoking was completed, pipes were cut into three segments\u2014bowl, stem (shaft), and tip (mouthpiece)\u2014using a hacksaw. Pipe fragments are more likely to preserve archaeologically rather than complete pipes. Thus, archaeologists are concerned with which areas of artifacts compounds will most likely be present. Pipe studies were designed to test the three main sections (bowl, stem, and tip) to better understand which portions should be selected for analysis. In addition to the three pipe segments, all materials, including syringes, tubing, stirring picks and ashes, were labeled and stored.</p>",

Each pipe section was then transferred to a new conical tube containing the same amount of acetonitrile:2-propanol:water [3:2:2] (APW) and sonicated for 10 min. Afterwards, each section was transferred to a 2.0 oz (59.15 ml) wide mouth glass jar (Uline Inc., Pleasant Prairie, WI, USA) containing the same amount of methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) and sonicated once more for 10 min.

A post-contact pipe, PIPE_108 (Washington State University-Museum of Anthropology Inventory Number: 45WW6.10), was also included in this study. Extraction and analysis of the archaeological artifacts followed a method that was very similar to the experimental pipe analysis, but they were not cut into pieces with a hacksaw.

Each artifact was then transferred to another glass beaker, submerged in acetonitrile:2-propanol:water [3:2:2] (APW), and sonicated for 10 min. Afterwards, each artifact was transferred to a glass beaker, submerged in methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), and sonicated once more for 10 min.

One microliter of sample was injected through a 2.0 \u00b5l sample loop using the full loop injection mode, and the flow rate was 0.32 ml/min with 0.10% formic acid/water (A) and 0.10% formic acid/methanol:acetonitrile [2:3] (B) in a slightly concave gradient elution mode. The gradient elution was applied as follows\u201497% A:3% B to 15% A:85% B from 0.00 to 12.00 min, changed to 3% A:97% B in 0.10 (12.10) min, maintained at 3% A:97% B until 14.00 min, returned to the initial conditions of 97% A:3% B in 0.10 (14.10) min, and then, before the next injection, maintained at 97% A:3% B until 16.00 min. The analysis time was 16.00 min. The autosampler chamber was set to 8 \u00b0C. Two Waters Acquity UPLC columns: HSS T3, 1.8 \u00b5m, 2.1 \u00d7 100 mm (T3 column) and BEH C18, 1.7 \u00b5m, 2.1 \u00d7 50 mm (C18 column) under three column temperatures, 35 \u00b0C, 50 \u00b0C, and 65 \u00b0C were compared. LC-MS analysis typically uses C18 (reverse-phase) columns. Nonetheless, we found that the specialized T3 column was better at retaining small molecules, such as nicotine. Our analysis also revealed that the T3 column at 35 \u00b0C was the ideal condition for analyzing the experimental pipes because this column became unstable at higher temperatures (e.g., degradation above 50 \u00b0C). Therefore, we used the T3 column at 35 \u00b0C for the pre- and post-contact pipe extracts.</p>",
