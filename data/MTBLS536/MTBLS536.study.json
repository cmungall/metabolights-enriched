HHSN272201200031C; see http://www.systemsbiology.emory.edu). The MaHPIC generates many data types (e.g., clinical, hematological, parasitological, metabolomics, functional genomics, lipidomics, proteomics, immune response) and mathematical models, to iteratively test and develop hypotheses related to the complex host-parasite dynamics in the course of malaria in non-human primates (NHPs), and metabolomics data via collaborations with investigators conducting clinical studies in malaria endemic countries, with the overarching goal of better understanding human disease, pathogenesis, and immunity. Curation and maintenance of all data and metadata are the responsibility of the MaHPIC.To access other publicly available results from this and other MaHPIC Experiments, including clinical results (specifics on drugs administered, diet, and veterinary interventions), and other omics, visit http://plasmodb.org/plasmo/mahpic.jsp.",

                "description": "Telemetry devices (DSI, model L11) with blood pressure sensors and electrocardiogram (ECG) leads were surgically implanted in two malaria-naive male rhesus macaques (<i>Macaca mulatta</i>), approximately three years of age.  After a resting period of two weeks, physiological data that include activity, temperature, ECG, and blood pressure were continuously collected.  Two weeks after activation of the telemetry implant, the macaques were inoculated intravenously with cryopreserved <i>P. knowlesi</i> Malayan strain salivary gland sporozoites, obtained from <i>Anopheles dirus</i> infected with parasites from the Pk1A+ clone. The <i>P. knowlesi</i> sporozoites were produced, isolated and cryopreserved at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  After inoculation, the macaques were profiled for clinical, hematological, parasitological, immunological, functional genomic, lipidomic, proteomic, metabolomic, telemetric and histopathological measurements. The experiment was designed for pathology studies, with terminal necropsies on days 11 (RKy15) or 19 (Red16).  The anti-malarial drug artemether was subcuratively administered selectively to one subject (REd16) during the primary parasitemia to suppress clinical complications. Capillary blood samples were collected daily for the measurement of complete blood counts, reticulocytes, and parasitemias. Capillary blood samples were collected every other day to obtain plasma for metabolomic analysis. Venous blood and bone marrow samples were collected at five timepoints for functional genomic, proteomic, lipidomic, and immunological analyses. Physiological data were continuously captured via telemetry. <br/>Within the MaHPIC, this project is known as 'Experiment 30'. This dataset was produced by Dean Jones at Emory University.

If more NIST plasma is needed, contact Bill Wallace at William.wallace@nist.gov<br/>\n<br/>\nStable isotopes:<br/>\n[13C6]-D-glucose, [15N]-indole, [15N,13C5]-L-methionine, [2-15N]-L-lysine dihydrochloride, [13C5]-L-glutamic acid, [15N]-L-tyrosine, [15N2]-uracil, [3,3-13C2]-cystine, [trimethyl-13C3]-caffeine, [U-13C5, U-15N2]-L-glutamine<br/>\n<br/>\nSample Preparation:<br/>\nPlasma/Serum<br/>\n<br/>\nC18 standard:<br/>\nCaffeine (1.5 min, 195.08)<br/>\nDiethyl-toluamide (6-6.6 min, 192.138)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnion Exchange standards:<br/>\nCystine (1-1.5 min, 241.04 (+2))<br/>\nCysteine-glutathione disulfide/CySSG (2-4 min, 427.09) <br/>\nCarboxymethyl-cysteine/CM-cysteine (very low) (3.5-5 min, 180.03)<br/>\nGlutathione disulfide/GSSG (+1 and +2) (7-8 min, 613.15; 307.08)<br/>\nCarboxymethyl-glutathione/CM-GSH (7-8 min, 366.09)<br/>\n<br/>\nAcetonitrile HPLC 99.9% Sigma-Aldrich 34998-4L<br/>\n</p><br/>\nProcedures:<br/>\n1. Sample batches; All samples are randomized to prevent batch degradation in one set of samples. Group individual subjects separately and then randomize the samples within the subject group. Example of a batch: Technical triplicates = 20 samples + 2 qstd = 25 hours (6 injections total).</br>\n2. Thaw 1 batch of samples per day on ice. 1st batch only \u2013 include NIST, Qstd, HILIC, C18, and any other pooled reference; all other batches will only need Qstd and other pooled references. Isotopes (internal standards) will also need to be thawed and spiked in all samples.</br>\n3. Make stock solution of Acetonitrile/isotope in Eppendorf tube; Per one sample = 100 \u00b5l Acetonitrile + 2.5 \u00b5l isotope. Triplicates =  20 samples = 2000 \u00b5l Acetonitrile + 50 \u00b5l isotope. Plasma sample, Qstd, and NIST are prepared the same way.</br>\n4. MaHPIC: 10 \u00b5l of samples were aliquoted into Eppendorf tubes, if possible, add water to reach 50\u00b5l of total solution. Qstd, and NIST: Pipette 50 \u00b5l sample into Eppendorf tube.</br>\n5. Pipette 100 \u00b5l of ACN:isotope stock solution to Eppendorf tube containing the sample. Keep samples on ice; let ACN crash proteins for 30 mins with a vortex every 15 mins. Centrifuge for 10 minutes @ 13.2rpm at 4 \u2103 and carefully pipette the supernatant (~100 \u00b5l) into autosampler vial. You will be able to see clear separation (cloudy and clear) \u2192 pipette only the clear supernatant.</br>\n6. The orbitrap will end up with the hi-lo-lo pattern for each sample triplicate.</br>",

In this set of algorithms, large capacities of LCMS data can be analyzed by realigning the m/z based on certain parameters.  The output of apLCMS includes retention times, m/z features that appeared in the LCMS run, and also the ion intensities of each of these m/z features for every sample. The data will be used for further data analysis.</br>\nFiles were converted to .cdf using Thermo File Converter and then to apLCMS.\n</p>\nQuality Assurance:</br>\n1. Five standards were chosen and graphed out to view the intensity over the entire set run. The standards provide information and assurance that the plasma samples were acceptable for further analysis.</br>\n2. Total Ion intensity was used as a good indicator on whether the batch was interrupted midway or not.\n</p>\nData Analysis and Quality Assurance\n1. xMSanalyzer: used for data extraction and quality evaluation (https://sourceforge.net/projects/xmsanalyzer/).</br>\nAll batches are ran together as a whole with xMSanalyzer (include the cdf, profile, rawprof, etc). The r script will run through multiple parameter settings. xMSanalzyer will merge different parameter settings and discard anything with a CV of higher than 50% and generate sample and quality reports. This information is included in the feature table worksheet.",
