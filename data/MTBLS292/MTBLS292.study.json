                "description": "The circadian clock is intricately connected with metabolism, however the precise details of these connections are incomplete. Here we used high temporal resolution metabolite profiling to determine circadian regulation of mouse liver and cell autonomous metabolism. In mouse liver, we found ~50% of metabolites were circadian, with strong enrichment of the nucleotide, amino acid, and methylation pathways. In U2OS cells, 27% of metabolites were circadian, including amino acids and NAD biosynthesis, also clock controlled in liver. To assess whether cell autonomous metabolite rhythms were clock-dependent, we used RNAi to perturb Bmal1, Cry1, and Cry2. Bmal1 knockdown eliminated most metabolite rhythms, while Cry1 generally shortened and Cry2 lengthened rhythms. Surprisingly, we found Cry1 knockdown induced 8 hr rhythms in amino acid, methylation, and vitamin metabolites, decoupling metabolite and transcriptional rhythms. These results provide the first comprehensive views of circadian liver and cell autonomous metabolism.",

Briefly, C57BL/6 mice of 6-wk-old male were acquired from Jackson Labs, entrained to a 12 hr:12 hr light:dark schedule for 1 wk. After 18 h of constant darkness, 3 mice were killed in the dark for every hr, for 48 hr. Liver samples were quickly excised and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Food and water were supplied ad libitum at all stages. All procedures were approved by the University of Pennsylvania Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.</br>\n</p>\nCell autonomus U2OS cell collection:\nCells were prepared as previously described [3]. Briefly, U2OS cells were seeded at 150,000 cells per 35-mm dishes in DMEM medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and antibiotics. Cells were transfected with 12 pmol of siRNA using Lipofectamine RNAiMax transfection reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. A negative control siRNA (AllStars Negative control siRNA; Qiagen) was used to ensure equal molar amounts of Bmal1, Cry1 and Cry2 siRNA were added in each condition. Cells were plated 4 days prior to synchronization and allowed to grow to confluence. Cells were synchronized with 0.1 \u00b5M dexamethasone. The collection began 48 hr post-synchronization. During the collection, cell pellets were collected and snap frozen every 2 hr for a total of 48 hr [4].<br/>\n</p>\nRef:<br/>\n[1] Hughes ME, DiTacchio L, Hayes KR, Vollmers C, Pulivarthy S, Baggs JE, Panda S, Hogenesch JB.

Briefly, a methanol:chloroform (2:1) mixture (300 \u03bcl) was added to cell pellets, then vortexed and sonicated for 15 min. Chloroform and water  (100 \u03bcl each) was then added and samples were vortexed. Organic and aqueous layers were separated by centrifugation at 13,300 rpm, for 7 min at 4 \u00b0C. Internal standard mix (C13 labeled citrate, fumarate, glutamate, arginine, lactate, glucose) were added to the aqueous layer and samples dried in a speed vac for 4 h until dry and immediately redissolved in mixture of 50:50 ACN:H2O. The samples were centrifuged at 13300 rpm for 5 min to remove fine particulates. The supernatant was transferred to a LC-MS certified sample vial for Ultraperformance liquid chromatography with 95:5 water:acetonitrile 20 mM ammonium acetate, pH 9 (solvent A) and  100% acetonitrile (Solvent B), on a Waters Acquity UPLC coupled to a Waters TQD mass spectrometer (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA).</br>\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Bligh EG, Dyer WJ.

Each sample was resolved for 22 min and the UPLC gradient starts with 15% A and 85% B at 0.15 ml/min, ramped to 70% A and 30% B in 5 min, followed by an isocratic hold for 10 min.

For every metabolic feature, a locally-weighted scatterplot smoothing function (LOESS) was fitted to the QC data, which was then used as a normalization factor for the samples as a function of run order. Additionally, metabolic features which appeared in less than 50% of the QC samples and displayed a relative standard deviation (RSD) greater than 30% were dropped from the final dataset.",

The entire set of duplicate sample injections were bracketed with a test mix of standard metabolites at the beginning and at the end of the run to evaluate instrument performance with respect to sensitivity and mass accuracy. The sample queue was randomized to remove bias. Data processing was done by using Waters TargetLynx software (version 4.1).",
