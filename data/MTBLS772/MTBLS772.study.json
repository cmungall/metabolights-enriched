                "description": "This study aims at assessing the capability of comparing and combining different instrumental platforms in an untargeted approach with a view of detecting chemical contaminants in food matrices at low levels. A strategy based on liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) and chemometrics has been applied on two different complex food contamination scenarios, with tea as study product. The first scenario aimed at mimic the presence of a dozen of contaminants at levels just above regulatory limits (i.e. 10 and 30 \u03bcg/kg); the second scenario, more complex, aimed at simulate the presence of several different contaminations at levels close to regulatory limits (10 \u03bcg/kg) in different samples. This work was carried on two LC-HRMS platforms (with respectively ToF and Orbitrap mass analyzer technologies), and a highly automated data treatment workflow was implemented to deal with data acquired on both platforms. The untargeted approach performed well on all scenarios (even the most complex) and analytical platforms. Performance comparison between LC-HRMS technologies was made possible thanks to a vendor-neutral data treatment process. </br><br/> Sub-samples of black tea (Keemun type, gross, China) were spiked at 10 \u00b5g/kg levels with two different spiking mixes: Three sub-samples were spiked with a pool of 11 contaminants (spiking mix n\u00b01); and Three sub-samples were spiked with 3 others contaminants (malathion, OTA, BPS, spiking mix n\u00b02). Samples were then extracted with a generic method and analyzed by LC-HRMS (in both positive and negative ionization modes) on two platforms (respectively Orbitrap and ToF to generate a total of four data sets. </br></br> Black tea spiked with contaminants is reported in the current study MTBLS772. </br> Green tea spiked with contaminants is reported in MTBLS771. </br><br/> Linked Studies: <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS771' target='_blank'><span class='label label-success'>MTBLS771</span></a>",

The first is a Waters Acquity UPLC H-Class system, composed of a quaternary solvent manager pump, a refrigerated sample manager Flow-Through-Needle and a column oven, coupled to a Waters high resolution Time-of-Flight mass spectrometer Xevo G2-S ToF. The second is a Thermo Scientific UltiMate 3000 UHPLC system composed of quaternary pumps, refrigerated auto-sampler and a column oven coupled to a Q-Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer. For each platform, the injection volume was 10 \u03bcl. Separation was made on a C18-PFP column (150 x 2.1 mm, 2 \u03bcm particle diameter, ACE supplied by AIT France), and the same chromatographic gradients were used on both instruments. An electrospray ionization source was used in both positive (ESI+) and negative (ESI-) modes. ESI+ and ESI- modes were run separately. For ESI+, the mobile phase was composed of water (A) and ACN (B), both acidified with 0.1% FA, and MeOH (C), flowing at 0.4 ml/min. Gradient started at 100% A and reached 100% B in 10 min, being kept for 6 min before switching to 100% C to rinse the system in 1 min, being held for 5 min, returning back to 100% A in 1 min and finally equilibrating for 3 min, with a total run duration of 26 min. For ESI-, the mobile phase was composed of water buffered at pH 6.45 with 10 mM of ammonium formate (A) and MeOH (B) flowing at 0.3 ml/min. The gradient started at 100% A and reached 100% B in 13 min, holding this condition for 7 min before turning back to 100% A in 1 min and finally equilibrating for 3 min, with a total run duration of 24 min. For both chromatographic methods the temperature of the column oven was kept at 30 \u00b0C.",

The UPLC-Orbitap-MS platform was a Thermo Scientific Q-Exactive Orbitrap MS operated in centroid mode (resolution of 70,000 FWHM at m/z 200, m/z range from 60 to 800). For the Orbitrap MS method \u201cAGC target\u201d and \u201cMaximum IT\u201d parameters were set to 106 and 200 ms respectively.\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Cladi\u00e8re M, Delaporte G, Le Roux E, Camel V.

Parameters for XCMS algorithm were inspired by those previously suggested[3] for high resolution UHPLC-Q-ToF and UHPLC-Orbitrap instruments. The full list of parameters for both Orbitrap and ToF data files can be found in Table A3 in the Supplementary material of the paper associated with this study.\n</p>\nAfter peak picking, data was imported in Matlab and peaks were first filtered using univariate statistical tests (student tests) and fold change determination. Peaks already present in blank injections (p-value<0.05 for t-test between sample groups and blank injections) were discarded, and only peaks exhibiting high contrast between sample groups were kept (p-value<0.05 for pairwise t-test between sample groups and fold change>2). A second filtration strategies based on the determination of a minimal relevant fold change has been implemented in parallel.\n</p>\nReduced data matrix was then log- and pareto-scaled and normalized using PQN (Probabilistic Quotient Normalization) before multivariate analysis with Independent Components Analysis (ICA). Thanks to ICA, data were visualized and discriminating peaks extracted and annotated with the help of a data base search and an isotopic pattern detection based on the previously published approach[4].\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Giacomoni F et al.
