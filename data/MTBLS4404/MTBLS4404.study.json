                "description": "<p>Cold stress negatively affects maize (<em>Zea mays</em> L.) growth, development and yield. Metabolic adjustments contribute to the adaptation of maize under cold stress. We show here that the transcription factor INDUCER OF CBF EXPRESSION 1 (ZmICE1) plays a prominent role in reprogramming amino acid metabolome and <em>COLD-RESPONSIVE</em> (<em>COR</em>) genes during cold stress in maize. Derivatives of amino acids glutamate/asparagine (Glu/Asn) induce a burst of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, which suppress the cold-mediated induction of <em>DEHYDRATION RESPONSE ELEMENT-BINDING PROTEIN 1</em> (<em>ZmDREB1</em>) genes and impair cold tolerance. ZmICE1 blocks this negative regulation of cold tolerance by directly repressing the expression of the key Glu/Asn biosynthesis genes, <em>ASPARAGINE SYNTHETASEs</em>. Moreover, ZmICE1 directly regulates the expression of <em>DREB1s</em>. Natural variation at the <em>ZmICE1</em> promoter determines the binding affinity of the transcriptional activator ZmMYB39, a positive regulator of cold tolerance in maize, resulting in different degrees of <em>ZmICE1</em> transcription and cold tolerance across inbred lines. This study thus unravels a mechanism of cold tolerance in maize and provides potential targets for engineering cold-tolerant varieties.</p>",

The maize inbred lines were provided by National Maize Improvement Center, China Agricultural University, Beijing. Maize seedlings were germinated and grown in pots in a greenhouse at 25 \u00b0C with a 16-h light/8-h dark photoperiod with approximately 200 \u03bcmol/m^2/s photon density and 60% relative humidity. The vermiculite, nutritious soil and Pindstrup soil mix (Denmark) were evenly mixed with a ratio of 1:1:1. For water planting, the maize seeds were germinated in vermiculite in pots in greenhouse. Uniform seedlings with two fully expanded leaves were transferred to a continuously aerated nutrient solution and renewed every 2 days. The nutrient solution was modified from Hoagland solution consisting of 0.75 mmol/L K2SO4, 2 mmol/L Ca (NO3)2\u00b74H2O, 0.65 mmol/L MgSO4\u00b77H2O, 0.1 mmol/L KCl, 0.25 mmol/L KH2PO4, 0.1 mmol/L Fe-EDTA, and micronutrients [1 \u03bcM MnSO4, 1 \u03bcM ZnSO4\u00b77H2O, 0.1 \u03bcM CuSO4\u00b75H2O, 0.005 \u03bcM (NH4)6Mo7O24\u00b74H2O and 1 \u03bcM H3BO3, and pH 6.0].</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Phenotyping and statistical analyses of maize cold tolerance. </strong></p><p>For the germination assay, seeds were sterilized with 10% H2O2 for 30 min, and washed 3 times with deionized water. The seeds were first germinated on wet filter paper at 25 \u00b0C for 12 h. After the imbibition, the seeds were transferred into cold chamber (12 \u00b0C) with a 16 h light / 8 h dark photoperiod. For cold treatment assays, maize seedlings with 2 fully expanded true leaves grown in soil at 25 \u00b0C were transferred to the cold room 4 \u00b0C with a 16 h light / 8 h dark photoperiod with approximately 100 \u00b5mol/m^2/s photon density. After 24 day cold treatment and 2 day recovery (at this time point, the injured tissues were severely wilted) the images of true leaves from the chilled seedlings were photographed. Then the full length and the injured length of 2 true leaves were measured by ImageJ software, respectively. The relative injury length was calculated with following formula: Relative injury length (%) = (L2+L2') / (L1+L1') x 100, where: L1 = full length of the first leaf; L1' = full length of the second leaf; L2 = injured length of the first leaf; L2' = injured length of the second leaf.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Metabolomics profiling and mGWAS analysis. </strong></p><p>mGWAS samples were conducted as follows. The maize inbred lines were grown in a controlled environment phytotron (with flexible temperature 20-35 \u00b0C \u00b1 0.5 \u00b0C). The seedlings for each inbred were grown in a pot with a randomly arrangement and grown under normal conditions for 2 weeks (16 h of light and 8 h of day, 25 \u00b0C). The samples were collected at ZT2 as untreated samples. The remaining seedlings were treated at 4 \u00b0C for 12 h under the same light condition and then were collected as cold treated samples. For each sample, leaves of at least 3 independent seedlings were harvested, which were stored at 80 \u00b0C prior to LC MS/MS analysis.</p>",

MS analysis was performed in the positive ion mode in the mass range from 70 to 1000 m/z with a resolution of 70,000. The HESI source parameters were as follows: Spray voltage at 3.5\u2009kV, Capillary temperature at 320\u2009\u00b0C, Sheath gas flow rate at 30 arb, Aux gas flow rate at 10 arb, Sweep gas flow rate at 5 arb, Heater temperature at 350\u2009\u00b0C, S-lens RF level at 55. The MS2 spectra of selected ions for confirmation were obtained with a normalized collision energy of 35 V, an isolation window of 0.8 m/z and a mass resolution of 17,500.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1] </strong>Cao J, Li M, Chen J, Liu P, Li Z.
