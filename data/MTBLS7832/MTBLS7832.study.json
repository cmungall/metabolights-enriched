                "description": "<p>Na\u00efve human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) that resemble the pre-implantation epiblasts are fueled by a combination of aerobic glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, but their mitochondrial regulators are poorly understood. Here we report that, proline dehydrogenase (PRODH), a mitochondria-localized proline metabolism enzyme, is dramatically upregulated in na\u00efve hESCs compared to their primed counterparts. The upregulation of PRODH is induced by a reduction in c-Myc expression that is dependent on PD0325901, a MEK inhibitor routinely present in naive hESC culture media. PRODH knockdown in naive hESCs significantly promoted mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (mtOXPHOS) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production that triggered autophagy, DNA damage, and apoptosis. Remarkably, MitoQ, a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant, effectively restored the pluripotency and proliferation of PRODH-knockdown na\u00efve hESCs, indicating that PRODH maintains na\u00efve pluripotency by preventing excessive ROS production. Concomitantly, PRODH knockdown significantly slowed down the proteolytic degradation of multiple key mitochondrial electron transport chain complex proteins. Thus, we revealed a crucial role of PRODH in limiting mtOXPHOS and ROS production, and thereby safeguarding na\u00efve pluripotency of hESCs.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Targeted metabolomics</strong> (amino acids and derivatives) - H9P (Primed) VS H9N (Na\u00efve) - is reported in the current study <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS7832' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS7832</strong></a>.</p><p><strong>Untargeted metabolomics</strong> - H9N PLKO.1 vs H9P PLKO.1 / H9P shPRODH vs H9P PLKO.1 / H9N shPRODH vs H9N PLKO.1 - is reported in <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS7840' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS7840</strong></a>.</p>",

In RSeT Feeder-Free (Rset) medium, primed hESCs were transformed into naive-like hESCs by following the instructions provided by the manufacturer (StemCell Technologies, 05975). Thereafter, the culture medium was changed every 2 days, and na\u00efve-like hESCs were passaged using TrypLE (Thermo Fisher, 12605010).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>PXGL na\u00efve hESC culture</strong></p><p>Conversion of primed hESCs to naive hESCs in the PXGL medium was achieved following the protocol previously published<strong>[1][2]</strong>. After initial passages on MEF, stabilized cells can then be maintained on Geltrex (growth factor-reduced, Thermo Fisher, A1413302) and dissociated with TrypLE. After plating the cell suspension, add 1 \u03bcL/cm^2 of Geltrex immediately to each well and gently shake to mix it all together. Y-27632, a ROCK inhibitor, was introduced during replating. Cells were fed with new PXGL media every 2 days. Cells can be split every 5 days at a ratio of 1:3 and cryopreserved using CryoStor CS10 (StemCell Technologies, 07930).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Targeted metabolomics</strong></p><p>For targeted metabolomics (amino acids and their derivatives) - H9P (Primed) VS H9N (Na\u00efve), the collected samples were thawed at 4 \u00b0C and mixed with 1 mL of cold methanol/acetonitrile/H2O (2:2:1,v/v/v).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Bredenkamp N, Stirparo GG, Nichols J, Smith A, Guo G.
