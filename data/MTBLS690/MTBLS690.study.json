                "description": "In this study we explored a unique cohort of 43 samples to build a map of metabolites varying in T2D across five different tissues (subcutaneous adipose tissue, liver, pancreatic islets, skeletal muscle and blood serum). The samples originate from the Excellence in Diabetes biobank (EXODIAB) in Sweden. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to create a map of metabolites across various metabolic-relevant tissues for the same cohort of individuals. In total we identified 286 unique metabolites, 32% of which were significantly altered between non-diabetes and T2D. We found evidence that amino acids (AAs) and bile acids are elevated for specific tissues in T2D and significantly associated to the percentage of glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). We showed that carnitines and lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs) are the most significantly altered metabolites in muscle, liver and serum in T2D. Finally, we attempted to explore the progression to overt T2D and suggest potential biomarkers in the early development of T2D, i.e. from non-diabetes to pre-diabetes to T2D.",

The samples were shaken at 30 Hz for 3 mins. The tungsten beads were removed, and the samples were left standing at room temperature for 30 mins. The samples were centrifuged at 14000 rpm, +4 \u00b0C for 3 mins and 80 \u00b5l of the aqueous phase were transferred to Eppendorf tubes. To each Eppendorf tube, 320 \u00b5l methanol (including D6-salicylic acid) was added, whereupon remaining proteins were precipitated at -20 \u00b0C for 1 hr. The samples were centrifuged for 10 mins at 14000 rpm, +4 \u00b0C and 50 \u00b5l supernatant were taken out to GC vials and 200 \u00b5l for LCMS.

The pancreatic islets and the adipose tissues were derivatized in a final volume of 30 \u00b5l, rather than 90 \u00b5l, which was used for all the other tissues. The derivatized sample (1 \u03bcl) was injected in splitless mode by a CTC Combi Pal autosampler (CTC Analytics AG, Switzerland) into an Agilent 6890 gas chromatograph equipped with a 10 m \u00d7 0.18 mm fused silica capillary column with a chemically bonded 0.18 \u03bcm DB 5-MS UI stationary phase (J&W Scientific).</br></br>\n\nLC-MS</br>\nBefore the LC-MS analysis the sample was re-suspended in 10 + 10 \u00b5l methanol and water. Each batch of samples was first analyzed in positive mode. After all samples within a batch were analyzed, the instrument was switched to negative mode and a second injection of each sample was performed. The chromatographic separation was performed on an Agilent 1290 Infinity UHPLC-system (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany). Each sample (2 \u03bcl) was injected onto an Acquity UPLC HSS T3, 2.1 \u00d7 50 mm, 1.8 \u03bcm C18 column in combination with a 2.1 mm \u00d7 5 mm, 1.8 \u03bcm VanGuard precolumn (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA) held at 40 \u00b0C. The gradient elution buffers were A (H2O, 0.1% formic acid) and B (75/25 acetonitrile:2-propanol, 0.1% formic acid), and the flow-rate was 0.5 ml/min. The compounds were eluted with a linear gradient consisting of 0.1 - 10 % B over 2 mins, B was increased to 99% over 5 mins and held at 99% for 2 mins; B was decreased to 0.1% for 0.3 mins and the flow-rate was increased to 0.8 ml/min for 0.5 mins; these conditions were held for 0.9 mins, after which the flow-rate was reduced to 0.5 ml/min for 0.1 mins before the next injection.</br></br>\n\nRef:</br>\n[1] A J, Trygg J, Gullberg J, Johansson AI, Jonsson P, Antti H, Marklund SL, Moritz T.

The gas flow rate through the column was 1 ml/min, the column temperature was held at 70 \u00b0C for 2 mins, then increased by 40 \u00b0C/min to 320 \u00b0C, and held there for 2 mins. The column effluent was introduced into the ion source of a Pegasus III time-of-flight mass spectrometer, GC/TOFMS (Leco Corp., St Joseph, MI, USA). The transfer line and the ion source temperatures were 250 \u00b0C and 200 \u00b0C, respectively. Ions were generated by a 70 eV electron beam at an ionization current of 2.0 mA, and 30 spectra/s were recorded in the mass range m/z 50 - 800. The acceleration voltage was turned on after a solvent delay of 150 secs. The detector voltage was 1500-2000 V.</br></br>\n\nLC-MS</br>\nThe compounds were detected with an Agilent 6550 Q-TOF mass spectrometer equipped with a jet stream electrospray ion source operating in positive or negative ion mode. The settings were kept identical between the two modes, with the difference lying in the capillary voltage. A reference interface was connected for accurate mass measurements; the reference ions purine (4 \u03bcM) and HP-0921 (Hexakis(1H, 1H, 3H-tetrafluoropropoxy)phosphazine) (1 \u03bcM) were infused directly into the MS at a flow rate of 0.05 ml/min for internal calibration, and the monitored ions were purine m/z 121.05 and m/z 119.03632; HP-0921 m/z 922.0098 and m/z 966.000725 for positive and negative mode respectively. The gas temperature was set to 150 \u00b0C, the drying gas flow to 16 l/min and the nebulizer pressure 35 psig. The sheath gas temp was set to 350 \u00b0C and the sheath gas flow 11 l/min. The capillary voltage was set to 4000 V in positive ion mode, and to 4000 V in negative ion mode. The nozzle voltage was 300 V. The fragmentor voltage was 380 V, the skimmer 45 V and the OCT 1 RF Vpp 750 V. The collision energy was set to 0 V. The m/z range was 70 - 1700, and data was collected in centroid mode with an acquisition rate of 4 scans s-1 (1977 transients/spectrum).",
