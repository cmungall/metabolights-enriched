                "description": "<p>Progressive multiple sclerosis (PMS) is currently diagnosed retrospectively. Here, we work towards a set of biomarkers that could assist in early diagnosis of PMS. A selection of cerebrospinal fluid metabolites (n=15) was shown to differentiate between PMS and its preceding phenotype in an independent cohort (AUC=0.93). Complementing the classifier with conformal prediction showed that highly confident predictions could be made, and that three out of eight patients developing PMS within three years of sample collection were predicted as PMS at that time point. Finally, this methodology was applied to PMS patients part of a clinical trial for intrathecal treatment with rituximab. The methodology showed that 68% of the patients decreased their similarity to the PMS phenotype one year after treatment. In conclusion, the inclusion of confidence predictors contributes with more information compared to traditional machine learning, and this information is relevant for disease monitoring.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Cohort 1 assays</strong> are reported in the current study <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS1464' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS1464</strong></a>.</p><p><strong>Cohort 2 assays</strong> are reported in <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS558' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS558</strong></a>.</p>",

Matches that did not have an MS/MS fragmentation spectrum available were noted as identified on level 1, whereas matches with an available MS/MS spectrum were noted as identified on level 2. Identities of metabolites whose MS/MS spectrum did not match with the suggested library identity were rejected.  To increase the identification rate, three additional identification strategies were used. First, an in silico prediction of MS/MS fragmentation spectra was done on metabolites available on the Human Metabolome Database (HMDB) using the PhenoMeNal framework. Briefly, OpenMS was used to extract metabolic features, which were imported into CAMERA to predict adducts, which further were used to derive the neutral masses of the precursors. Neutral masses and MS/MS spectra were then used in CSI:FingerID to perform the in silico identification.  Additionally, the identification workflow for untargeted metabolomics using online databases and chemical composition prediction in the Compound discoverer software from Thermo Fisher Scientific (v. 3.1.0.305) was used as well as the metfRag R package with the KEGG database and an allowance of 10 ppm relative mass deviation for the database search and 20 ppm for fragment peak matching.",
