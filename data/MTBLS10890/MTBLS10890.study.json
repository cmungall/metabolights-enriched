                "description": "<p>Cariogenic microorganisms as well as salivary metabolic status in early childhood caries (ECC) have been reported to differ from that in adult caries. The main aim of this study was to identify specific microbial species and salivary metabolites in children with ECC using species-specific qPCR and untargeted metabolomic approach. Scardovia wiggsiae, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Lactobacillus salivarius and Candida albicans were more prevalent in ECC group. Prevalence of ECC was higher in children with two targeted species present. Histidine metabolism and valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation were activated in ECC group, while glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, Purine and Pyrimidine metabolism were inhibited. Histidine and glutathione metabolism was activated with enrichment of targeted microorganism, while linoleic acid and biotin metabolism was inhibited. These findings suggest that detection / co-detection of targeted microorganisms can well describe caries status in children. Microbial and metabolite biomarkers can be used in caries control for children.</p>",

Altogether 2 moblie phase condition was used to improve the metabolite coverage. For condition 1, solvent A (0.1% formic acid in water) and solvent B (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile/methanol, 4/6) were used to elute the metabolites with a 13.5 min gradient, as follows: 10% B at 0.0 min, 0.25 mL/min; 40% B at 3.0 min, 0.25 mL/min; 95% B at 5.0 min, 0.25 mL/min; 100% B at 8.0 min, 0.6 mL/min; 100% B at 10.0 min, 0.6 mL/min; and back to 10% B at 10.5 min, 0.25 mL/min; and equilibrate for 3.0 min. Samples were analyzed using a Q Exactive HF-X (QE-HF-X) mass spectrometry equipped with a heated electrospray ionization (HESI) source.&nbsp;All the data was acquired in positive and negtive switching mode using full scan detection, and the PQC were also analyzed with full scan/ddMS2 to acquire MS2 fragementation for metaoblite identificaiton and annotation. For conditon 2, solvent A was 6.5 mM NH4HCO3 in water, solvent B was 6.5 mM NH4HCO3 in methanol. The 12.0 min gradient was employed: 0.0 min, 0.25 mL/min, 10% B; 4.0 min, 0.25 mL/min, 40% B; 6.0 min, 0.25 mL/min, 95% B; 8.0 min, 0.4 mL/min, 99% B; 8.5 min, 0.4 mL/min, 99% B; 8.6 min, 0.25 mL/min, 10% B; 12.0 min, 0.25 mL/min, 10% B. Data acquisiton were performed only in negative mode, and full scan was used for all the samples, and full scan/ddMS2 was also used for PQC samples. The settings for full scan were as follows: 60000 resolution, AGC target, 1e6; Maximum IT, 100 ms; scan range, 60-900 m/z. For full scan/ddMS2 (DDA), Top 20 MS/MS spectral (dd-MS2) @15000 were generated with AGC target = 2e5, Maximum IT = 25 ms and (N)CE/stepped NCE = 10, 40, 80 V.</p>",
