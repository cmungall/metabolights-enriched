                "description": "Bulb, leaf, scape and flower samples of British bluebells (<i>Hyacinthoides non-scripta</i>) were collected regularly for one growth period. Methanolic extracts of freeze-dried and ground samples showed antitrypanosomal activity, giving more than 50% inhibition, for 20 out of 41 samples. High-resolution mass spectrometry was used in the dereplication of the methanolic extracts of the different plant parts. The results revealed differences in the chemical profile with bulb samples being distinctly different from all aerial parts. High molecular weight metabolites were more abundant in the flowers, shoots and leaves compared to smaller molecular weight ones in the bulbs. The anti-trypanosomal activity of the extracts was linked to the accumulation of high molecular weight compounds, which were matched with saponin glycosides, while triterpenoids and steroids occurred in the inactive extracts. Dereplication studies were employed to identify the significant metabolites via chemotaxonomic filters and considering their previously reported bioactivities.",

Bluebell plants were removed from this soil sample and separated into different tissue types (bulbs, leaves, scapes, shoots and flowers). The tissue types were combined, freeze-dried (CHRIST Alpha 1-2 LD plus) and ground using pestle and mortar. Each sample contained approximately 20 individual plants. The first sample was taken in March 2014 of plants with an emerged shoot. The end of the plant\u2019s life occurred in July followed by the subterranean phase (during the end of July-October). On 3 occasions, samples from the time of shoot emergence and re-growth in the following growth period were also taken to account for 1 full growth period.",

The samples were eluted through a C-18 column (ACE, 75 mm, id 3.0 mm, particle size 5 \u03bcm). The mobile phase used 0.1% formic acid in HPLC-grade water (solvent A) and acetonitrile (solvent B). The flow rate was 300 \u00b5l/min. Gradient elution was employed, commencing at 10% B, held for 5 min, increased to 100% B over 30 min, held for another 5 min before decreasing back to 10% B, held for 4 min. Solvent blank refers to sample containing solvent only which was run for the purpose of subtracting background spectra.",

The processed positive and negative raw data were then converted to CSV files and imported into an in-house macro written in Excel[2]. Peaks with intensities 20 times greater in the samples than in the blank solvent were retained. Through EXCEL, macros were also run to match the m/z peaks with the DNP database version 2015[33] to enable dereplication of the ion peaks at a m/z threshold of \u00b13 ppm, which provided a list of known and unknown metabolites according to their peak intensity.
