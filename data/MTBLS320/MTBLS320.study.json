                "description": "Efflux pumps are critically important membrane components that play a crucial role in strain tolerance in Pseudomonas putida to antibiotics and aromatic hydrocarbons that result in these toxicants being expelled from the bacteria. Here, the effect of propranolol on P. putida was examined by sudden addition of 0.2, 0.4 and 0.6 mg/ml of this \u03b2-blocker to several strains of P. putida, including the wild type DOT-T1E and the efflux pump knockout mutants DOT-T1E-PS28 and DOT-T1E-18. Bacterial viability measurements reveal that the efflux pump TtgABC plays a more important role than the TtgGHI pump in strain tolerance to propranolol. Mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy was then used as a rapid, high-throughput screening tool to investigate any phenotypic changes resulting from exposure to varying levels of propranolol. Multivariate statistical analysis of these MIR data revealed gradient trends in resultant ordination scores plots, which were related to the concentration of propranolol. MIR illustrated phenotypic changes associated with the presence of this drug within the cell that could be assigned to significant changes that occurred within the bacterial protein components. To complement this phenotypic fingerprinting approach metabolic profiling was performed using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to identify metabolites of interest during the growth of bacteria following toxic perturbation with the same concentration levels of propranolol. Metabolic profiling revealed that ornithine, which was only produced by P. putida cells in the presence of propranolol, presents itself as a major metabolic feature that has important functions in propranolol stress tolerance mechanisms within this highly significant and environmentally relevant species of bacteria.",

All strains were sub-cultured in triplicate to obtain axenic cultures. Individual colonies were then picked and transferred from plates into 250 ml flasks containing 50 ml of autoclaved Lysogeny broth (LB) medium and incubated at 24 h at 30 \u00b0C in an orbital incubator (Infors HT Ltd, UK) shaking at 200 rpm.</br>\n</p>\n2. Growth in response to propranolol shock, sample collection and analysis:</br>\nCells were grown in 50 ml of LB medium for 5 h at 30 \u00b0C and 200 rpm. Once cell cultures reached the mid-exponential phase, samples were divided into two groups. One group was kept as a control, and to the second group propranolol was added at three different concentrations (0.2, 0.4 and 0.6 mg/ml). These cultures were then incubated for an additional 8 h.</br>\n</p>\n3. Sample collection and quenching:</br>\n15 ml samples were quenched at three time points 0, 10 and 60 min before and after the addition of propranolol (0 min refers to the point immediately before the addition of propranolol).

Thus, in order to halt metabolism culture samples (15 ml) were plunged into a double volume of 60% cold methanol (-50 \u00b0C) in a 50 ml tube. The quenched culture mixture was centrifuged (3000 \u00d7 g, 10 min, 1 \u00b0C), and then the supernatant was discarded, while the cell pellets were stored at -80 \u00b0C until required for metabolite extraction.</br>\nThe methanol metabolite extraction method was undertaken by suspending the biomass in 750 \u00b5l of 80% cold methanol (-20 \u00b0C) which was transferred to a new 2 ml Eppendorf tube. This was followed by a freeze-thaw cycle in order to extract the intracellular polar metabolites from the cells. Samples were centrifuged at (13500 \u00d7 g, 3 min, 4 \u00b0C) and supernatant transferred to new tubes and stored on dry ice. The extraction was performed again on the remaining pellet and both supernatants were combined and again stored on dry ice.  A final aliquot (1400 \u00b5l) of metabolite extracts were normalised using 80% methanol according to OD at 660 nm.</br>\nA quality control (QC) sample was prepared by transferring 100 \u00b5l from each of the samples to a new (15 ml) centrifuge tube. This was followed by the addition of (100 \u00b5l) of internal standard solution (0.2 mg/ml glycine-d5, 0.2 mg/ml benzoic-d5 acid, 0.2 mg/ml lysine-d4, and 0.2 mg/ml succinic-d4 acid) to all samples. The samples were lyophilized for 16 h by speed vacuum concentrator (concentrator 5301; Eppendorf, Cambridge, UK), and then the pellet was stored at -80 \u00b0C for further analysis.\n",

Samples were derivatised for GC-MS following a two stage process as described previously [1]. Briefly, 50 \u00b5l O-methylhdroxylamine hydrochloride solution (20 mg/ml in pyridine) was added to all samples. The samples were then heated using a heating block at 65 \u00b0C for 40 min followed by addition of 50 \u00b5l of MSTFA (N-methyl-trimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide) and then heated for 40 min. An aliquot (20 \u00b5l) of retention index solution (C10/CH12/C15/C19/C22 n-alkanes) was added for chromatographic alignment.</br>\nThe gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF-MS) method was used to analyse the derivatised samples in a random order. The instrument was operated using an Agilent 6890 GC instrument linked to a LECO Pegasus III TOF mass spectrometer (Leco, St. Joseph, MI, USA), as described previously [2][3] which follows metabolomic standards initiative (MSI) guidelines [4]. QC samples were employed prior to statistical analysis as described from previous report [1], in order to provide quality assurance of the data by the evaluation and removal of mass features that exhibit high deviation within the QC samples.</br>\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Wedge DC, Allwood JW, Dunn W, Vaughan AA, Simpson K, Brown M, Priest L, Blackhall FH, Whetton AD, Dive C, Goodacre R.
