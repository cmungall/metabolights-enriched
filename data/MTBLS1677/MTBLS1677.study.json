                "description": "<p>A set of 917 wines of Czech origin registered in a national competition were analysed using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) with the aim to build and evaluate multivariate statistical models and machine learning methods for the classification of type (5 types), variety (13 varieties) and location (4 locations) based on 1H NMR spectra. The predictive models afforded more than 93% of correctness for classification of dry and medium dry, medium, sweet white wines and dry red wines. The trained Random Forest (RF) method is able to classify Pinot noir with 96% of correctness, Blaufr\u00e4nkisch 96%, Riesling 92%, Cabernet Sauvignon 77%, Chardonnay 76%, Gew\u00fcrtztraminer 60%, Hibernal 60%, Gr\u00fcner Veltliner 52%, Pinot gris 48%, Sauvignon Blanc 45%, P\u00e1lava 40%. Pinot blanc and Chardonnay are varieties, which are often misplaced and were discriminated with 71% of correctness. Chemometrics represents prospective tool to predict important features in wine, potentially important in quality assessment and fraud detection.</p>",

The wines were from 5 sub-regions of Bohemia and Moravia (see Fig S1 in the paper associated with this study): Mikulovska (250 samples), Slovacka (153 samples), Velkopavlovicka (143 samples), Znojemska (111 samples) and Melnicka (8 samples); for 2 wines, the area was unclassified. The wines belonged to 6 types based on wine colour and residual sugar content (see Table S1 in the paper associated with this study): 494 wines were categorised as dry and medium dry white wines, 137 as medium white wines, 36 as sweet white wines, 44 as roses and blancs de noir, 188 as dry red wines and 4 as other red wines. The wines were made from wine grape varieties including Riesling (88 samples), Chardonnay (70 samples), Pinot gris (70 samples), Sauvignon Blanc (63 samples), Welschriesling (62 samples), Pinot noir (58 samples), Gruner Veltliner (51 samples), Gewurtztraminer (50 samples), Pinot blanc (47 samples), Blaufrankisch (37 samples), Palava (36 samples), Cabernet Sauvignon (24 samples), Hibernal (24 samples), Zweigeltrebe (20 samples), Gruner Silvaner (19 samples), Saint Laurent (19 samples), Neuburger (14 samples), Merlot (13 samples), Muskat Moravsky (13 samples), Andre (12 samples), Muller-Thurgau (12 samples), Cabernet Moravia (11 samples), Blauer Portugieser (9 samples), Dornfelder (7 samples), Kerner (6 samples), Aurelius (5 samples) and Alibernet (3 samples); 16 samples were classified as other, and 45 samples were cuvee. The year of harvest ranged between 2007 and 2017. The sugars and the actual alcoholic strength of the wines were previously assessed by analytical methods approved by The International Organisation of Vine and Wine (OIV) and declared on the certificate of analysis, which is required for introduction to the market (International Organisation of Vine and Wine, 2019).</p>",

                        "description": "<p>1H NMR spectra were subjected to phase and baseline correction using the Whitakker smoother algorithm in MestReNova software version 14.1.0 (Mestrelab Reserach S.L., Santiago de Compostela, Spain). The spectra were calibrated to the internal standard DSS at 0.0 ppm and aligned by global alignment based on a reference spectrum. Specific scripts were implemented for data reduction. The 1H NMR spectral data were reduced into 0.04-ppm spectral bins using the sum of the datapoints, and the region corresponding to water (4.74-4.98) was excluded. The binning width of 0.04 ppm represents a compromise between preserving sufficient data resolution and minimizing the loss of spectral information and the effect of peak drift. To avoid false grouping of samples in chemometrics models caused by the pH and paramagnetic properties of the wines, the bins from areas with large drift (1.02-1.34, 1.34-1.42, 2.02-2.10, 2.62-2.74, 3.58-3.66, 4.38-4.54, 8.22-8.42) were summed. A total of 226 bins were used for analysis. The spectra were then normalized to the average intensity of the internal standard and the total spectral area. The data were log-transformed, mean-centred and divided by the standard deviation of each variable (auto- scaled) obtained using the package \u2018MetaboAnalyst\u2019 version 2.0<strong>[1]</strong> in R 3.5.0. The bins were used as variables for subsequent statistical analysis and modelling.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Chong J, Yamamoto M, Xia J.
