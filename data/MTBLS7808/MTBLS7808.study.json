                "description": "<p>Hepatic steatosis is the initial manifestation of abnormal liver functions and often leads to liver diseases such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in humans and fatty liver syndrome in animals. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of a large chicken population consisting of 705 adult hens by combining host genome resequencing, liver transcriptome, proteome and metabolome analysis, as well as microbial 16S rRNA gene sequencing of each gut segment. The results showed the heritability (h2 = 0.25) and duodenal microbiability (m2 = 0.26) of hepatic steatosis were relatively high, indicating a large effect of host genetics and duodenal microbiota on chicken hepatic steatosis. Individuals with hepatic steatosis had low microbiota diversity and a decreased genetic potential to process triglyceride output from hepatocytes, fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation activity and resistance to fatty acid peroxidation. Furthermore, we revealed a molecular network linking host genomic variants (GGA6: 5.59-5.69 Mb), hepatic gene/protein expression (PEMT, phosphatidyl-ethanolamine N-methyltransferase), metabolite abundances (folate, S-adenosylmethionine, homocysteine, phosphatidyl-ethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine) and duodenal microbes (genus Lactobacillus) to hepatic steatosis, which could provide new insights into the regulatory mechanism of fatty liver development.</p>",

Birds were generated from 2 hatches and reared in individual cages under similar conditions. These birds were fed a basic diet and provided with free access to feed and water. No antibiotics were administered to the hens in our study. At 90 weeks of age, body weight was measured using an electronic scale to the nearest 5 g. Blood samples were collected from the wing vein and stored at -20 \u00b0C. Plasma was separated by centrifugation at 3000 x g for 15 min and stored at -20 \u00b0C until use. Fecal samples were manually collected from the rectum with sterile cotton swabs. Each bird was then euthanized by cervical dislocation followed by decapitation. The contents of the duodenum, jejunum, ileum and cecum, including the chyme and mucosa, were immediately collected after opening the abdomen. All intestinal samples were dispensed into 2 mL tubes, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 \u00b0C.</p><p><br></p><p>The weights of the liver and abdominal fat tissue surrounding the gizzard, cloaca and adjacent abdominal muscles were to the nearest 1 g with the electronic scale. Subsequently, some the liver tissue sample was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 \u00b0C immediately after collection for genomic DNA, tissue RNA, protein and metabolite extraction. Some of the liver was placed in a sterile plastic bag on dry ice using forceps and stored at -20 \u00b0C to measure biochemical indicators. The remaining liver sample was fixed in formalin for 48-72 h for histological observation.</p><p><br></p><p>Liver histology was assessed in liver sections embedded in paraffin and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) using standard techniques. Whole section images of each liver sample were obtained using a Canon EOS 7D digital camera (Canon, Tokyo, Japan) and quantified using Image J (ver 1.8.0, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). The investigators were blind to the group allocations. Therefore, a veterinary science pathologist performed the hepatic steatosis assessment using the NASH Clinical Research Network Scoring System in humans. All liver samples were graded from A to C, representing healthy individuals, and mild-moderate and severe hepatic steatosis. For extremely typical individuals that could represent each group, metabolome profiling was performed.</p><p><br></p><p>All experiments involving animals were conducted according to the ethical policies and procedures approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of China Agricultural University, China (Issue No.32303202-1-1).</p>",

The ESI source operation parameters were as follows<strong>[1]</strong>: source temperature, 500 \u00b0C; ion spray voltage (IS), 5500 V (positive) / -4500 V (negative); ion source gas I (GSI), gas II (GSII) and curtain gas (CUR) were set at 55, 60 and 25 psi, respectively; the collision gas (CAD) was high. Instrument tuning and mass calibration were performed with 10 and 100 \u03bcmol/L polypropylene glycol solutions in QQQ and LIT modes, respectively. Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode was used to quantitatively analyze metabolite levels. Specific MRM transitions were monitored for each period based upon the metabolites eluted during that period. That is, the characteristic ions of each substance were selected by the triple quadrupole mass analyzer, and the signal intensities were acquired by the detector.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Chen W, Gong L, Guo Z, Wang W, Zhang H, Liu X, Yu S, Xiong L, Luo J.

Qualitative analyses were conducted based on retention time (RT) values, ion pairs and MS2 spectra for identified metabolites utilizing a self-constructed target standard product database MWDB (metware database). Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode was used to quantitatively analyze metabolite levels. MultiQuant 3.03 was used to open off-machine mass-spectra files for samples, followed by the integration and calibration of chromatographic peaks. Peak area for individual chromatograms corresponds to the relative abundance of that metabolite, with integral peak area values being saved. The relative abundance of all detected metabolites in different samples was assessed based upon RT and peak type for each metabolite, with qualitative and quantitative accuracy being ensured through the calibration of chromatographic peaks for each metabolite. A quality control (QC) sample consisting of a mixture of 10 \u00b5L of each prepared sample was analyzed after every 10 sample acquisitions to ensure that these analyses were repeatable. Coefficient of variation (CV) values for the metabolites present within these QC samples were then calculated, with those metabolites exhibiting a CV &gt; 0.5 in positive or negative ion mode being excluded from this analysis. MetOrigin (http://metorigin.met-bioinformatics.cn/) was used to analyze the origins of these metabolites. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG, https://www.kegg.jp/) was used to evaluate the function of target metabolites.</p>",
