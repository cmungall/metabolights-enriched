                "description": "Ficus deltoidea Jack (Moraceae) is a plant used in Malaysia for various conditions including as a supplement in diabetes management. Morphology distinction of the 7 varieties (var. angustifolia, var. bilobata, var. deltoidea, var. intermedia, var. kunstleri, var. motleyana and var. trengganuensis) is challenging due to the extreme leaf heterophylly and unclear varietal boundaries, making it difficult for authentication and quality control of F. deltoidea products. In this study, we applied untargeted UHPLC-HRMS metabolomics and a genetic approach to the authentication of 7 F. deltoidea varieties collected from 6 locations throughout Peninsular Malaysia. The PCA and HCA analysis showed 3 main chemotypes based on the differentiation in the main flavonoids content; var. terengganuensis and var. intermedia (chemotypes-a), var. angustifolia (chemotype-b) and var. bilobata, var. deltoidea, var. kunstleri and var. motleyana (chemotype-c). Using these groupings, the supervised PLS-DA analysis identified 15 glycosylated flavones as markers together with 1 furanocoumarin. These markers were always consistent for the respective varieties, regardless of the geographical origin and if the plants were of wild or cultivated. Additionally, the chemotaxonomy differentiation was also validated by DNA sequencing. In particular, var. bilobata accession which showed divergent morphology was also differentiated by the chemical fingerprints and genotype.

About 100 mg \u00b1 2 mg of the leaves were then ground and extracted with 2 ml of 85% aqueous methanol using a bead mill (2 cm diameter, frequency 30 Hz and time 2 min) from Retsch MM 200 (Haan, Germany), followed by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant was enriched by solid phase extraction (SPE). A C18 SPE cartridge (Finisterre by Teknokroma, 100 mg, 1 ml) was pre-conditioned with 85% methanol before allowing the supernatant to pass through. The eluent was evaporated completely under vacuum (Genevac HT-4X, Genevac Technologies, Ipswich England) and reconstituted in 85% methanol to a concentration of 2 mg/ml for mass spectrometry analysis. Quality control (QC) sample was prepared by combining equal aliquot of all samples.",

Data was acquired on a MassLynx software version 4.1 (Waters, Milford, MA, USA). The ESI operation parameters for the negative ionization were as follows: capillary voltage 2400 V, cone voltage 40 V, dessolvation temperature 330 \u00b0C, source temperature 120 \u00b0C, cone gas flow 20 l/h, dessolvation gas flow 700 l/h and multichannel plate detector voltage at 2450 V. MS was calibrated for a mass range of 100-1000 Da using sodium formate to a mass error of less than 2 ppm. Sodium formate solution was prepared by mixing 0.1 M sodium hydroxide, 10% formic acid and acetonitrile (1:1:8 v/v). Leucine-enkaphalin (0.25 ppm with 0.1% formic acid) was used as internal reference and infused through the LockSpray probe at 7 \u00b5l/min using LC pump (Shidmazu LC-10ADvp, Duisburg, Germany).
