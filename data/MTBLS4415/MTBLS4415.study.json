                "description": "<p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> In all living organisms,&nbsp;DNA replication is exquisitely regulated in a wide range of growth conditions to achieve timely and accurate genome duplication prior to cell division. Failures in this regulation cause DNA damage with potentially disastrous consequences for cell viability and human health,&nbsp;including cancer. To cope with these threats, cells tightly&nbsp;control replication initiation&nbsp;using well-known mechanisms. They also&nbsp;couple DNA synthesis to nutrient richness and growth rate&nbsp;through a poorly understood process thought to involve central carbon metabolism.&nbsp;One such process&nbsp;may involve the cross-species conserved pyruvate kinase (PykA) which catalyzes the last reaction of glycolysis. Here we have investigated the role of PykA in regulating DNA replication&nbsp;in the model system&nbsp;<em>Bacillus subtilis.</em></p><p><strong>RESULTS: </strong>On analysing mutants of the catalytic (Cat) and C-terminal (PEPut) domains of&nbsp;<em>B. subtilis</em>&nbsp;PykA we found&nbsp;replication phenotypes in conditions where PykA is dispensable for growth. These phenotypes are independent from the effect of mutations on PykA catalytic activity and are not associated with significant changes in the metabolome. PEPut operates as a nutrient-dependent inhibitor of initiation while Cat acts as a stimulator of replication fork speed. Disruption of either PEPut or Cat replication function dramatically impacted the cell cycle and replication timing even in cells fully proficient in known replication control functions. <em>In vitro</em>, PykA modulates activities of enzymes essential for replication initiation and elongation via functional interactions. Additional experiments showed that PEPut regulates PykA activity and that Cat and PEPut determinants important for PykA catalytic activity regulation are also important for PykA-driven replication functions.</p><p><strong>CONCLUSIONS:</strong> We infer from our findings that PykA typifies a new family of cross-species replication control regulators that drive the metabolic control of replication through a mechanism involving regulatory determinants of PykA catalytic activity. As disruption of PykA replication functions causes dramatic replication defects, we suggest that dysfunctions in this new family of universal replication regulators may pave the path to genetic instability and carcinogenesis.</p>",

The cells were further grown to an OD600 between 0.6 and 0.8 in a shaking incubator (Climo Shaker ISF1-X K\u00fchner).

Briefly, a saturated overnight minimal media liquid culture was diluted in a fresh liquid media at an OD600 = 0.05, and further grown to an OD600 = 0.2. In total 5 mL of this culture were filtered onto a 47 mm PTFE filter (0.45 \u00b5m). The filter was then positioned with cells on top on an agarose plate containing the same minimal media.

Briefly, the cell pellet was resuspended in 200 \u03bcL of water:methanol:acetonitrile (1:3:1) and placed in a cold bath (-80 \u00b0C) composed of dry ice and ethanol. After cell freezing, the mixture was left at 25 \u00b0C to complete unfreezing of the cells. This procedure was repeated twice to completely break the cells. The metabolites were next rocked on a shaker for 1 h at 4 \u00b0C. The metabolites were centrifuged at 5000 x g at 4 \u00b0C for 10 min. The supernatant was dried and stored at -80 \u00b0C. Before LC-MS analysis, the metabolites were suspended with 20 \u03bcL water and 42 \u03bcL 80% acetonitrile and 20% 10 mM ammonium carbonate (pH 9.9), centrifuged at 5000 x g at 4 \u00b0C for 10 min.

Briefly, metabolism was quenched by placing the filter containing the cells face-down in a glass dish containing 5 mL of a cold (-30 \u00b0C) mixture of 80% acetonitrile and 20% methanol. After 15 min at -30 \u00b0C, the filter coated with cells was submitted to a mild sonication in an ultrasonic bath (Bronson 2510 Ultrasonic Cleaner) for 5 min at 4 \u00b0C to remove the cells from the filter. The quenching liquid containing the cells was transferred into a cryogenic vial and underwent 6 freeze/thaw cycles in liquid nitrogen per 65 \u00b0C water to fully break the cells and extract the metabolites. The samples were lyophilized and first dissolved in 300 \u00b5L water. The debris were removed by centrifugation (2000 x g, 4 \u00b0C, 10 min) and the supernatant was filtered on 0.22 \u00b5m (Millipore Millex-GV 13 mm). The filter was further washed with 700 \u00b5L 80:20 acetonitrile containing 10 mM ammonium carbonate (pH adjusted to 9.9 with NH4OH). The resulting 1 mL samples were stored at 4 \u00b0C and analyzed within 24 h.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1] </strong>Metabolomics Service Protocol Sample Preparation for Cells [Internet].
