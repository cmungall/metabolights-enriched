                "description": "<p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> Protozoan Leishmania parasites are responsible for a range of clinical infections that represent a substantial challenge for global health. Amphotericin B (AmB) is increasingly used to treat Leishmania infection, so understanding the potential for resistance to this drug is an important priority. Previously we described four independently-derived AmB-resistant L. mexicana lines that exhibited resistance-associated genetic lesions resulting in altered sterol content. However, substantial phenotypic variation between these lines, including differences in virulence attributes, were not fully explained by these changes.</p><p><strong>METHODS:</strong> To identify alterations in cellular metabolism potentially related to phenotypic differences between wild-type and AmB-resistant lines, we extracted metabolites and performed untargeted metabolomics by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.</p><p><strong>RESULTS:</strong> We observed substantial differences in metabolite abundance between lines, arising in an apparently stochastic manner. Concerted remodeling of central carbon metabolism was not observed; however, in three lines, decreased abundance of several oligohexoses was observed. Given that the oligomannose mannogen is an important virulence factor in Leishmania, this could relate to loss of virulence in these lines. Increased abundance of the reduced forms of the oxidative stress-protective thiols trypanothione and glutathione was also observed in multiple lines.</p><p><strong>CONCLUSIONS:</strong> This dataset will provide a useful resource for understanding the molecular basis of drug resistance in Leishmania, and suggests a role for metabolic changes separate from the primary mechanism of drug resistance in determining the phenotypic profile of parasite lines subjected to experimental selection of resistance.</p>",

Prior to sample extraction, parasite cell lines grown in the presence of AmB (wild-type parasites were cultured in the absence of drug) were diluted to approximately 10^5 parasites/ml and incubated for 3 days without AmB until parasites reached mid-log phase (5-10 x 10^6 parasites/ml), at which point cells were counted and 10^8 parasites were taken for metabolite extraction. Cultures were rapidly cooled to &lt; 10 \u00b0C in a dry ice-ethanol bath with rapid agitation to avoid freezing, and samples were kept at 4 \u00b0C for the remaining stages of extraction, based on the method of t\u2019Kindt and colleagues[2].

Flow rates were as follows (in arbitrary units): 40 for sheath gas, 5 for auxiliary gas, 1 for sweep gas. Samples were ionized by electrospray ionization (ESI). Positive mode ionization was performed with a source voltage of +4.5 kV, a capillary voltage of +50 V, a tube voltage of +70 V, and a skimmer voltage of +20 V. Negative mode ionization was performed with a source voltage of -3.5 kV, a capillary voltage of -50 V, a tube voltage of -70 V, and a skimmer voltage of -20 V. Mass calibration was performed with each polarity prior to every analysis batch using Thermo Calmix standards for m/z &lt; 1,400 (Pierce calibration solutions, Thermo Scientific), with additional inclusion of ubiquitous low-mass contaminants (C2H6NO2, m/z 76.0393, for positive ion ESI and C3H5O3, m/z 89.0244, for negative ESI). These low-mass contaminants were used to apply lock-mass correction to each analytical run, to enhance calibration stability.</p>",

Putative metabolite identification corresponds for the most part to Metabolite Standards Initiative (MSI) level 2 (mass only), whereas metabolites matching in retention time to an included standard correspond to level 1, as indicated in Table 1[3], in the paper associated with this study. Peaks having an area with root squared deviation across pooled samples &gt; 50% were excluded, as were those with a retention time &lt; 4 min (due to poor resolution) those identified as peptides (due to poor reproducibility), and those not matched to a metabolite. Peaks were subjected to initial filtering in which poor quality peaks were manually removed (performed in a blinded fashion in which metabolite names were unknown). Data were then log-transformed (log10(intensity + 1)) and a one-way ANOVA test was performed, followed by a Tukey\u2019s Honest Significant Difference post hoc test to compare sample groups. A Benjamini-Hochberg multiple comparisons procedure was used to adjust p-values from the initial ANOVA. All statistical analysis was performed in R, and plots were generated using ggplot2[4] and gplots[5] R packages.</p><p><br></p><p>Ref:</p><p>[1] Scheltema RA, Jankevics A, Jansen RC, Swertz MA, Breitling R.
