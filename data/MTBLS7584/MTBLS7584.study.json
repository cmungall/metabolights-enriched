                "description": "<p><strong>PURPOSE:</strong> Olfactory dysfunction (OD) is a debilitating symptom frequently reported by patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and it is associated with a dysregulated sinonasal inflammation. However, little information is available about the effect of the inflammation-related nasal microbiota and related metabolites on the olfactory function in these patients. Therefore, the current study aimed to investigate the nasal microbiota-metabolites-immune interactions and their role in the pathogenesis of OD in CRS patients.</p><p><strong>METHODS:</strong> 23 and 19 CRS patients with and without OD (NOD), respectively, were enrolled in the present study. The 'Sniffin' Sticks' was used to measure the olfactory function, while the metagenomic shotgun sequencing and the untargeted metabolomic profiling were performed to assess the differences in terms of the nasal microbiome and metabolome between the two groups. The levels of nasal mucus inflammatory mediators were investigated by a multiplex flow Cytometric Bead Array (CBA).</p><p><strong>RESULTS:</strong> A decreased diversity in the nasal microbiome from the OD group compared to the NOD group was evidenced. The metagenomic analysis revealed a significant enrichment of <em>Acinetobacter johnsonii</em> in the OD group, while <em>Mycoplasma arginini</em>, <em>Aeromonas dhakensis</em> and <em>Salmonella enterica</em> were significantly less represented (LDA value &gt; 3, p &lt; 0.05). The nasal metabolome profiles were significantly different between the OD and NOD groups (P &lt; 0.05). The purine metabolism was the most significantly enriched metabolic subpathway in OD patients compared with NOD patients (P &lt; 0.001). The expressions of IL-5, IL-8, MIP-1alpha, MCP-1 and TNF were statistically and significantly increased in the OD group (P &lt; 0.05). All these data, including the dysregulation of the nasal microbiota, differential metabolites and elevated inflammatory mediators in OD patients demonstrated a clear interaction relationship.</p><p><strong>CONCLUSIONS:</strong> The disturbed nasal microbiota-metabolite-immune interaction networks may be implicated in the pathogenesis of OD in CRS patients and the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms need to be further investigated in future studies.</p>",

The exclusion criteria adopted included: &lt; 18 years old; presence of other types of olfactory disorders; previous nasal surgery; concomitant presence of an autoimmune or immunodeficiency disease; treatment with antibiotics, corticosteroid, antihistamines, and leukotrienes receptor antagonists in the month before the sampling; presence of an acute exacerbation of chronic rhinosinusitis. The study design was approved by the Ethics Committee at Beijing Anzhen Hospital (GZR-3-077). All the subjects agreed with written informed consent before enrolling in the study.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Clinical assessment</strong></p><p>Based on the nasal endoscopy exam, patients were classified into chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) and chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis (CRSsNP). The 22-item Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22) was used to assess the CRS-related quality of life<strong>[2]</strong>. The radiological and endoscopic severity of the sinus disease was assessed by the Lund-Mackay scoring system and the Lund-Kennedy scale, respectively<strong>[3][4]</strong>. Demographic and clinical data, including age, gender, smoking/drinking habits, asthma history and related hematological indices, were collected from all the participants.</p><p><br></p><p>The olfaction function was assessed utilizing the authoritative and validated olfaction assessment tool - Sniffin sticks<strong>[5]</strong>, which was composed of 3 subtests - odor threshold, odor discrimination and odor identification. The odor threshold subtest was comprised of felt-tip pens with 16 different concentrations of phenethyl alcohol (PEA), and the participants were asked to discriminate the odor-containing pen from 2 blanks through a 3-alternative forced choice (3-AFC) task (odor threshold score ranged from 1 to 16 points). The odor discrimination test consisted of 16 triplets of pens, with one of which contained a different odor than the other two. Participants were required to determine the specific pen with a different odor through a 3-AFC task. The number of correctly identified odors was an odor discrimination score ranging from 0 to 16 points. The odor identification test contained 16 different pens with common and familiar odorants. The subjects were required to identify and label the odor of the given pen under the prompt of the 4 alternative descriptors. The odor identification score corresponded to the number of correctly identified odors.</p><p><br></p><p>The sum of the 3 subtest scores was counted as the total TDI scores, with a range from 1 to 48 points. TDI scores \u2265 30.75 were considered indicative of a normal olfactory function. When the score was &lt; 30.75, the OD was diagnosed. Of these, TDI scores between 16.25 and 30.50 were considered to be hyposmia (decreased olfactory function), while if below or equal to 16.0 they were considered to be functional anosmia (absent olfactory function).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Sample collection</strong></p><p>Nasal mucus samples were acquired on the same day of the olfactory function evaluation. Under endoscopic guidance, a 22 x 7 x 2 mm polyurethane sponge was placed in the middle nasal meatus of the participants for 10 min. Then the sponge was removed, immediately put into a microporous centrifugal filter device, and centrifuged at 14,000 x g for 15 min to elute mucus. The eluted mucus was placed into a new microcentrifuge tube and frozen at -80 \u00b0C until analysis. The untargeted metabolite profiling was conducted through liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Fokkens WJ, Lund VJ, Hopkins C, Hellings PW, Kern R, Reitsma S, Toppila-Salmi S, Bernal-Sprekelsen M, Mullol J, Alobid I, Terezinha Anselmo-Lima W, Bachert C, Baroody F, von Buchwald C, Cervin A, Cohen N, Constantinidis J, De Gabory L, Desrosiers M, Diamant Z, Douglas RG, Gevaert PH, Hafner A, Harvey RJ, Joos GF, Kalogjera L, Knill A, Kocks JH, Landis BN, Limpens J, Lebeer S, Lourenco O, Meco C, Matricardi PM, O'Mahony L, Philpott CM, Ryan D, Schlosser R, Senior B, Smith TL, Teeling T, Tomazic PV, Wang DY, Wang D, Zhang L, Agius AM, Ahlstrom-Emanuelsson C, Alabri R, Albu S, Alhabash S, Aleksic A, Aloulah M, Al-Qudah M, Alsaleh S, Baban MA, Baudoin T, Balvers T, Battaglia P, Bedoya JD, Beule A, Bofares KM, Braverman I, Brozek-Madry E, Richard B, Callejas C, Carrie S, Caulley L, Chussi D, de Corso E, Coste A, El Hadi U, Elfarouk A, Eloy PH, Farrokhi S, Felisati G, Ferrari MD, Fishchuk R, Grayson W, Goncalves PM, Grdinic B, Grgic V, Hamizan AW, Heinichen JV, Husain S, Ping TI, Ivaska J, Jakimovska F, Jovancevic L, Kakande E, Kamel R, Karpischenko S, Kariyawasam HH, Kawauchi H, Kjeldsen A, Klimek L, Krzeski A, Kopacheva Barsova G, Kim SW, Lal D, Letort JJ, Lopatin A, Mahdjoubi A, Mesbahi A, Netkovski J, Nyenbue Tshipukane D, Obando-Valverde A, Okano M, Onerci M, Ong YK, Orlandi R, Otori N, Ouennoughy K, Ozkan M, Peric A, Plzak J, Prokopakis E, Prepageran N, Psaltis A, Pugin B, Raftopulos M, Rombaux P, Riechelmann H, Sahtout S, Sarafoleanu CC, Searyoh K, Rhee CS, Shi J, Shkoukani M, Shukuryan AK, Sicak M, Smyth D, Sindvongs K, Soklic Kosak T, Stjarne P, Sutikno B, Steinsvag S, Tantilipikorn P, Thanaviratananich S, Tran T, Urbancic J, Valiulius A, Vasquez de Aparicio C, Vicheva D, Virkkula PM, Vicente G, Voegels R, Wagenmann MM, Wardani RS, Welge-Lussen A, Witterick I, Wright E, Zabolotniy D, Zsolt B, Zwetsloot CP.
