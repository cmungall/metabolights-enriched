                "description": "<p>A discovery-based lipid profiling study of serum samples from a cohort that included patients with clear cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (ccRCC) stage I, II, III, and IV (n=112) and controls (n=52) was performed using ultraperformance liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry and machine learning techniques. Multivariate models based on support vector machines and the LASSO variable selection method yielded two discriminant lipid panels for ccRCC detection and early diagnosis. A 16-lipid panel allowed discriminating ccRCC patients from controls with 95.7% accuracy in a training set under cross- validation, and 77.1% accuracy in an independent test set. A second model trained to discriminate early (I and II) from late (III and IV) stage ccRCC yielded a panel of 26 compounds that classified stage I patients from an independent test set with 82.1% accuracy. Thirteen species, including cholic acid, undecylenic acid, lauric acid, LPC(16:0/0:0), and PC(18:2/18:2) identified with level 1 exhibited significant lower levels in samples from ccRCC patients compared to controls. Moreover, 3\u03b1-hydroxy-5\u03b1-androstan-17-one 3-sulfate, cis-5-dodecenoic acid, arachidonic acid, cis-13-docosenoic acid, PI(16:0/18:1), PC(16:0/18:2), and PC(O-16:0/20:4) contributed to discriminate early from late ccRCC stage patients. The results are auspicious for early ccRCC diagnosis after validation of the panels in larger and different cohorts.</p>",

H. Roffo' (IOAHR). Samples were drawn from healthy individuals and patients from IOAHR and from 'Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires (HIBA)', Argentina, following the guidelines approved by the IOAHR Institutional Review Board, and after signature of the corresponding informed consent. The cohort consisted of 52 healthy individuals (controls) and 112 ccRCC patients with stage (S) I, II, III or IV. Additional samples were collected from patients with chromophobe RCC (chRCC, n=16), and papillary RCC (papRCC, n=8). The male:female ratio in samples was approximately 2:1, following the worldwide incidence trend<strong>[1]</strong>. The age population was 58\u00b110 years (mean\u00b1SD) in controls, 60\u00b19 years in ccRCC patients, 53\u00b114 years in chRCC patients, and 61\u00b19 years in papRCC patients. The means of the age populations for the binary comparisons were not significantly different using the Mann-Whitney U test at the 0.05 level. Blood samples were drawn before surgery from untreated patients and from healthy individuals with 8 h of fasting. Samples from all subjects were subjected to a serological analysis to discard those with a positive result for HIV, Hepatitis B and C. According to the BPMSO standard operating procedure, 20 ml of blood were collected in tubes without any anticoagulant and left 15 min at 25 \u00b0C to allow the clot formation and centrifuged at 600 x g for 10 min. Serum samples were subsequently split into aliquots and stored at -80 \u00b0C. Aliquots were used only once after thawing.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Bray F, Ferlay J, Soerjomataram I, Siegel RL, Torre LA, Jemal A.

Cold (4 \u00baC) isopropanol was added to serum samples in a 3:1 solvent:sample volume ratio for protein precipitation and lipid extraction<strong>[1][2]</strong>. Samples were subsequently vortex-mixed for 10 s and centrifuged at 16000 x g for 20 min at 4 \u00baC. Different types of quality control (QC) samples were prepared and jointly analyzed with the study samples<strong>[3]</strong>. 10 intra-study QC samples (QCss) consisting of pools of equal volume aliquots of subsets of the study samples were generated and followed protein precipitation and further sample preparation steps. Each subset included randomly selected serum samples from controls and patients with different RCC stages and histology. A process blank QC sample (QCblank) was prepared by replacing serum with ultrapure water. Commercial serum from the male North American population was used as inter and intra-lab QC sample, and as a long-term reference sample. Supernatants from the study samples and QC samples were randomly lyophilized in 10 batches at -80 \u00b0C and 50 mTorr for 48 h using a Telstar LYOQuest-85 freeze dryer (Telstar, Madrid, Spain). After lyophilization, samples were stored at -80 \u00b0C until analysis.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Sarafian MH, Gaudin M, Lewis MR, Martin FP, Holmes E, Nicholson JK, Dumas ME.

After reconstitution, samples were further vortex-mixed and centrifuged at 16000 x g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C. Supernatants were subsequently transferred to LC vials for analysis. A second type of intra-study QC sample that consisted of pooled reconstituted serum samples from an independent set of healthy individuals (n=5) from the same population under study (QCHI) was included for analysis. The QCHI sample was split in several aliquots and stored at -80 \u00b0C until analysis. A chemical standard mixture that included saturated fatty acids (C10:0, C11:0, C12:0, C17:0, C18:0, C20:0, C22:0), different phospholipids (PC(16:0/16:0), PC(16:0/18:1), PC(18:1/18:1), PE(18:1/18:1), SM(18:1/16:0) and lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC16:0 and LPC18:0)) dissolved in water/methanol/acetonitrile/isopropanol (40:10:25:25 v/v), was also analyzed to evaluate adduct type formation, retention time and fragmentation patterns in tandem MS experiments, and therefore, to aid assessing the lipid identification process.</p><p><br></p><p>Ultraperformance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) lipid profiling analyses were performed on a Waters ACQUITY UPLC I-Class system fitted with a Waters ACQUITY UPLC BEH C18 VanGuard pre-column (2.1 mm x 5 mm, 1.7 \u03bcm particle size) connected directly to the inlet of a Waters ACQUITY UPLC BEH C18 column (2.1 x 100 mm, 1.7 \u03bcm particle size, Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA), and coupled to a Xevo G2S QTOF mass spectrometer (Waters Corporation, Manchester, UK) with an electrospray ionization (ESI) source. The typical resolving power and mass accuracy of the Xevo G2S QTOF mass spectrometer were 32,000 FWHM and 0.2 ppm at m/z 554.2615, respectively. The chromatographic separation method for lipid analysis was adapted from a previously published method<strong>[1]</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p>Gradient elution was conducted with acetonitrile:water (60:40 v/v) mixed with 10 mM ammonium acetate and 0.1% acetic acid (mobile phase A) and isopropanol:acetonitrile (90:10 v/v) mixed with 10 mM ammonium acetate and 0.1% acetic acid (mobile phase B), with the following program: 0-2 min 40-43% B; 2-2.1 min 43-50% B; 2.1-12.0 min 50-54% B; 12.0-12.1 min 54-70% B; 12.1-18.0 min 70-99% B; 18.0-19.0 min 99% B. The flow rate was constant at 0.4 ml/min for 12 min and was decreased to 0.30 ml/min between 12 and 19 min. Subsequently, the gradient was returned to its initial conditions in 11 min. The injection volume was 2 \u03bcl. The temperature of the column and the autosampler tray was set to 55 and 5 \u00b0C, respectively.</p><p><br></p><p>Quality assurance procedures were followed throughout the analytical workflow. System suitability procedures were performed before data acquisition of the study samples to determine that the method and associated instrumentation were fully functioning. The intra-lab QC sample was injected before and after the intra-study QCHI sample which was injected 26 times for conditioning the UPLC-MS system before sample analysis. </p><p><br></p><p>Samples were randomly analyzed in 10 batches by UPLC-QTOF-MS together with a system suitability blank (reconstitution solvent) and QC samples along 10 days. The coefficients of variation of selected features in the intra-lab QC and intra-study QCHI samples were daily analyzed to ensure data quality, including instrument performance, method reproducibility, and mass accuracy. Moreover, unsupervised principal component analysis (PCA) was performed daily to inspect data quality before analyzing a new batch.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Sarafian MH, Gaudin M, Lewis MR, Martin FP, Holmes E, Nicholson JK, Dumas ME.

The different steps involved in this procedure included retention time alignment, peak picking, deisotoping, integration, and deconvolution by grouping together adduct ions derived from the same compound. The following adduct ions were considered for deconvolution: [M - H]-; [2M - H]-; [3M - H]-; [M + Cl]-; [M + Na- 2H]-; [M + K- 2H]-; [M + HCOO]-; [M + CH3COO]-; [M - H2O - H]-. Neutral masses provided by Progenesis QI as a result of deconvolution were manually reviewed based on the isotopic patterns and the mass difference between detected ions. When incorrect assignments were detected, the m/z values associated to the most intense ionic species from the group of adducts originally informed by the Progenesis QI software were retained. Different filters were applied for data cleaning. Blank deduction was applied to features with a peak area of at least 3-fold or more in samples than in process blanks; otherwise, the area was set to 0<strong>[1]</strong>. After process blank subtraction, only features present in at least 50% of one class (controls, SI-, SII-, SIII- and SIV-ccRCC patients) were retained. Only features having monoisotopic peaks with signal intensity larger than 10^3 in the continuum mass spectra; exhibiting a mass difference lower than 10 mDa compared to the intra-study QCss, and exhibiting the isotopic pattern were retained. The matrix obtained after this procedure, comprised of 386 features, was normalized to the total peak area for each sample. This matrix was used to develop and train supervised multivariate models based on SVM and the LASSO<strong>[2]</strong> variable selection method. The data were autoscaled before statistical analysis. A PCA model was built with the 386-feature matrix to evaluate data quality and confirm intra-study QCss sample clustering.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Kirwan JA, Weber RJ, Broadhurst DI, Viant MR.

Ultra-high-purity argon (\u2265 99.999%) was used as the collision gas. Data acquisition and processing were carried out using MassLynx version 4.1 (Waters Corp., Milford, MA, USA). Additional experiments were conducted in positive ion mode to assist with feature identification, using a probe capillary voltage of 2.5 kV.</p><p><br></p><p>Lipid identification was attempted for all the discriminant features. Elemental formulae were generated based on accurate masses and isotopic patterns, and were used to assess spectral adducts ions. Lipid identification was further confirmed with tandem MS experiments, and validated through retention time and fragmentation pattern matching with chemical standards when possible. Neutral masses were searched in the LIPID MAPS database<strong>[1]</strong>, and elemental formulae were searched in the Human Metabolome Database (HMDB)<strong>[2]</strong>. For some cases, neutral masses or m/z values were also searched in the HMDB and METLIN database<strong>[3]</strong>. The mass window tolerance was set at 10 mDa. Experimental tandem MS spectra were compared to the aforementioned databases and for cases where MS/MS spectra were not available, fragmentation patterns were manually interpreted for annotation. Chemical standard solutions were prepared in water/methanol/acetonitrile/isopropanol (40:10:25:25 v/v), and were analyzed under identical conditions as serum samples to validate putative lipid identities. Different collision cell voltages were used to assist in fragmentation pattern interpretation. 2 different quadrupole-mass windows of 6 and 1 Da were used in tandem MS experiments to address spectral overlap due to quadrupole co-selection. The narrower mass window provided higher selectivity at the expense of lower sensitivity. When the precursor ion intensity was too low to conduct tandem MS experiments or when quadrupole co-selection could not be mitigated, tentative identification was not informed. To avoid misidentification, tandem MS experiments were conducted not only for the discriminant feature but also for the different adduct ions corresponding to the same compound both in negative and positive ion modes. Diagnostic and characteristic fragments and neutral losses, as well as the position of substituents in phospholipids (PLs) were assigned based on the literature<strong>[4]-[6]</strong>. The terminology used for lipids and fragment ion annotation follows the Lipidomics Standards Initiative (LSI).</p><p><br></p><p>Spiking experiments were also conducted with the standards on serum samples to address retention time differences caused by serum matrix effects. When endogenous compound levels were too high, samples were diluted 10-fold before spiking with chemical standards. Moreover, for putatively annotated compounds that did not interact with the stationary phase of the C18 column, and exhibited a retention time close to the dead time, complementary experiments were conducted using HILIC-HRMS. Serum samples, spiked serum samples with chemical standards, and chemical standard solutions were analyzed under the same conditions to assess retention time and mass spectra matching. Confidence levels for metabolite identification are reported based on the established criteria suggested by the Metabolomics Standards Initiative (MSI)<strong>[7]-[9]</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Sud M, Fahy E, Cotter D, Brown A, Dennis EA, Glass CK, Merrill AH Jr, Murphy RC, Raetz CR, Russell DW, Subramaniam S.
