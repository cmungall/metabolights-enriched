                "description": "<p>Symbiotic microorganisms play an important role in the growth and development of marine invertebrates, such as the sea moon, affecting their metamorphosis process. The outbreak of jellyfish puts pressure on marine ecosystems and affects their stability. However, researches on the development of jellyfish are still fewer, the use of biological control of jellyfish disaster is still in the theoretical stage, and the inhibition mechanism of microorganisms on jellyfish remains to be revealed. We isolated a strain of <em>Bacillus</em> <em>paramycoides </em>SG15 from rhizosphere sediments of seagrass <em>Zostera japonica</em>, and found that this strain could inhibit the asexual reproduction of jellyfish <em>Aurelia coerulea </em>polyp larva. Through co-culture experiments, we used transcriptomics, metabolomics and fluorescence in situ hybridization techniques, combined with the genome and metabolome of SG15, and found that this isolate could inhibit the asexual reproduction rate of the larva polyp by inhibiting the absorption of vitamins, and the endoderm cells were the most important action site of SG15. Although there are relatively high concentrations of vitamins and their derivatives in the surrounding environment, the transport of hydra is reduced, and most vitamins cannot be synthesized in the polys as well, thus affecting the growth and reproduction of polyps. Our study, analyzed the interaction processes between Bacillus and polyps and revealed the inhibiting mechanism of the polyp asexual reproduction by <em>B. paramycoides</em> SG15, which laid a theoretical foundation for the subsequent analysis of interactions between jellyfish and microorganisms, bring materials for the biological control of jellyfish disasters.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Polyps whole organism</strong> is reported in the current study&nbsp;<a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS9409' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS9409</strong></a>.</p><p><strong>Polyps culture media</strong> is reported in&nbsp;<a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS9419' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS9419</strong></a>.</p>",

The metabolites detected in \u2265 80% of samples were retained, and then minimum metabolite values were set for the samples below the limit of quantitation. Metabolites were normalized by summation. The QC data were used as the internal standard, and metabolites with a relative standard deviation (RSD) &gt; 30% were discarded. The logarithmic transformation was performed to identify significant differences in the level of metabolites between groups.</p>",
