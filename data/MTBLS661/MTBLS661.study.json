                "description": "Mycothiol (MSH) and ergothioneine (ERG) are thiols able to compensate for each other to protect mycobacteria such as Mycobacterium smegmatis against oxidative stress. Gamma-glutamylcysteine (GGC), another thiol and an intermediate in ERG biosynthesis has detoxification abilities. Five enzymes are involved in ERG biosynthesis, namely EgtA, EgtB, EgtC, EgtD and EgtE. The role of these enzymes in the production of ERG had been unclear. On the other hand, the enzyme MshA is known to be essential for MSH biosynthesis. In this manuscript, we describe the raw data of the generation and characterization of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) mutants harbouring a deletion of the gene coding for each of these enzymes, and the raw data of the phenotypic characterization of the obtained thiol-deficient M.tb mutants. Through a high throughput screening approach, compounds not previously used in a tuberculosis (TB) regimen were identified. Raw data depicting the effect of these compounds on the generated thiol-deficient M.tb mutants, on the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and thiols in the M.tb wild type strain are described in this study.",

The cell extract was clarified by centrifugation, and the pH was equilibrated to between 8 and 9 with 0.4 M ammonium bicarbonate (ABC). The residual beads were removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was filtered with 13-mm diameter/0.2-\u00b5m pores size syringe filters (PVDF or cellulose acetate membrane).\n</p>\nFor the quantitation of MSH, all biological replicates of the cell extracts were stored at -20 \u00b0C after every extraction. The extracellular fractions (1 ml of the culture supernatant filtered twice) were lyophilized and re-suspended in the extraction buffer used for the intracellular fractions. After pH equilibration with ABC, every sample (intracellular and extracellular fractions) was treated with 0.02 M DTT (Dithiothreitol) for 10 min at room temperature and derivatized the same day with a final concentration of 2 mM monobromobimane of (mBBr) at 60 \u00b0C for ~15 min in the dark.\n</p>\nFor the quantification of ERG the derivatization was performed using a previously described method as follows. The intracellular and extracellular fractions were lyophilized and re-suspended in 300 \u00b5l of the resuspension buffer (2.48 mg/ml diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)). A volume of 250 \u00b5l of the suspension was added to 450 \u00b5l of the derivatization buffer (2.48 mg/ml DTPA and 48 mg/ml HEPES, pH 8.2) that contained a final concentration of 0.7 mM mBBr. After derivatization at 45 \u00b0C for 45 min in the dark, the reaction was quenched with 143 mM HCl.\n</p>\nAlternatively all thiols were exrtracted/derivatized using a second method as follows: the lyophilized supernatants and the frozen pellets were re-suspended in 500 \u00b5l of the lysis buffer (50% acetonitrile, 20 mM Hepes ~pH 8, 2 mM monobromobimanne) and sonicated at 60 \u00baC in a water bath sonicator for 30 min protected from the light. Lysed samples were centrifuged and the supernatants were filtered and acidified to a final concentration of ~1 mM acetic acid. Acidified samples were processed for UPLC-MS analyses for the quantification of MSH, ERG, GGC as previously described.",

The total amount per vial was calculated by multiplying the given concentration by the total resuspension volume (820ul for Batch-1, 500 \u00b5l for Batch-2 and -3). This was further divided by the total volume of culture from which the sample was extracted, to have the final concentration per ml of culture, which was subsequently divided by the predetermined CFU per ml of culture for each strain. Alternative the total CFU per total volume of culture from which each sample derived was calculated and used to normalize the total amount of metabolite per vial to have the concentration of metabolite per 10^5 CFU. Volume of culture from which intracellular samples derived  was 35 ml for Batch-1, and 5 ml for Batch-2 and Bacth-3. While all extracellular samples derived from 1 ml of cultures.\n</p>\nFor the relative quantifications such as that of MSH and hercynine, the given peak area was multiplied by half the total resuspension volume (assuming the peak area corresponds to 2 \u00b5l, since the injection volume was 2 \u00b5l). The total peak area was divided by the culture volume and subsequently by the CFU count, simply by dividing by the pre-calculated total CFU as described above. Alternatively, ERG standard curve was used to deduce the absolute concentration of MSH in the data deriving from the second method (Batch-2). Values are represented as peak areas or picogram per 10^5 CFUs.",
