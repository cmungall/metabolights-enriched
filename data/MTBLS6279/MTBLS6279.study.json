                "description": "<p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> Ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) is the leading cause of acute kidney injury (AKI). The current standard of care focuses on supporting kidney function, stating the need for more efficient and targeted therapies to enhance repair. Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) and their secretome, either as conditioned medium (CM) or extracellular vesicles (EVs), have emerged as promising options for regenerative therapy, however, their full potential in treating AKI remains unknown.</p><p><strong>METHODS:</strong> In this study, we employed an in vitro model of chemically-induced ischemia using antimycin A combined with 2-deoxy-D-glucose to induce ischemic injury in proximal tubule epithelial cells. Afterwards, we evaluated the effects of MSC secretome, CM or EVs obtained from adipose tissue, bone marrow and umbilical cord, on ameliorating the detrimental effects of ischemia. To assess the damage and treatment outcomes, we analyzed cell morphology, mitochondrial health parameters (mitochondrial activity, ATP production, mass and membrane potential) and overall cell metabolism by metabolomics.</p><p><strong>RESULTS:</strong> Our findings show that ischemic injury caused cytoskeletal changes confirmed by disruption of the F-actin network, energetic imbalance as revealed by a 50% decrease in the oxygen consumption rate, increased oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and reduced cell metabolism. Upon treatment with MSC secretome, the morphological derangements were partly restored and ATP production increased by 40-50%, with umbilical cord-derived EVs being most effective. Furthermore, MSC treatment led to phenotype restoration as indicated by an increase in cell bioenergetics, including increased levels of glycolysis intermediates, as well as an accumulation of antioxidant metabolites.</p><p><strong>CONCLUSION:</strong> Our in vitro model effectively replicated the in vivo-like morphological and molecular changes observed during ischemic injury. Additionally, treatment with MSC secretome ameliorated proximal tubule damage, highlighting its potential as a viable therapeutic option for targeting AKI.</p>",

Mycoplasma contamination was checked monthly and was found to be negative in all cells used. ciPTECs were used for experiments from passage numbers 42 to 50, during which robust and reproducible results were obtained in agreement with previous findings<strong>[2]-[4]</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>MSCs culture</strong></p><p>The MSCs, all human-derived, were obtained within the European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 research and innovation collaborative network RenalToolBox (Grant Agreement 813839) and well-characterized<strong>[5]</strong>. A-MSCs from lipoaspirates were processed in Heidelberg (Germany) after obtaining informed consent (Mannheim Ethics Commission; vote number 2006- 192NMA). B-MSCs provided by Galway (Ireland) (Galway University Hospital Clinical Research Ethics Committee; approval number 02/08) were purchased from Lonza (Basel, Switzerland) and U-MSCs with informed consent obtained in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki were sourced from the NHS Blood and Transplant and transferred to the University of Liverpool (United Kingdom) (NHS Blood and Transplant, Cellular and Molecular Therapies; approval number: RTB21112019). MSCs were cultured as reported previously<strong>[5]</strong>. Briefly, A-MSCs were seeded at a density of 300 cells/cm^2, and B- and U-110 MSCs at 3000 cells/cm^2 at 37 \u00b0C with 5% (v/v) CO2, and cultured in basic growth medium (MEM-alpha media, Gibco, ThermoFisher Scientific), supplemented with 10% of fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco, ThermoFisher Scientifics, Cat-No. 10,270-106, Lot 42Q7096K) until reaching 80% confluency. A thorough characterization of all 3 MSC sources, including morphology, growth kinetics, differentiation capabilities and immunophenotypic profiles, was recently published<strong>[5]</strong>. In the current study, all MSCs were cultured from passage number 3 to 6.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>CM collection</strong></p><p>Upon reaching 80% confluency, MSCs were washed once with HBSS and incubated for 24 h in serum-free MEM-alpha media. The supernatant was then collected and centrifuged for 5 min at 400 x g to remove cell debris before being transferred to Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal units (3 kDa molecular cutoff) (Millipore, UFC900324) for concentration at 3000 x g for 90 min at 4 \u00b0C. Concentrated CM was then stored at -80 \u00b0C until further use.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>EV isolation</strong></p><p>EVs from MSCs were collected as reported previously<strong>[6]</strong>. Briefly, the supernatant was collected and centrifuged for 10 min at 300 x g to remove cell debris, transferred into new tubes and centrifuged for 20 min at 3000 x g to discard apoptotic cells. The supernatant was then ultracentrifuged for 1 h at 10,000 x g and 4 \u00b0C, using the Beckman Coulter Optima L-100K Ultracentrifuge with the rotor type 70 Ti. At this speed, the subpopulation of 10k EVs (large EVs, LEVs) was collected. The supernatant was further ultracentrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 x g and 4 \u00b0C, to obtain the 100k EV (small EVs, SEVs) subpopulation. The EV pellet was resuspended in PBS supplemented with 0.1% DMSO and stored at -80 \u00b0C until further use.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>ciPTEC ischemic model</strong></p><p>To mimic ischemia in vitro, ciPTECs were exposed to 10 nM of antimycin A (AA, Sigma-Aldrich, A8674) and 20 mM of 2-Deoxy-D-Glucose (2DG, Sigma-Aldrich D6134), as previously described<strong>[7]-[10]</strong>, for 24 h in serum-free medium (SFM) at 37 \u00b0C under normoxia (21% O2). Additionally, to enhance the simulation of blood supply disruption which deprives cells of nutrients, we exposed these chemically-treated ciPTECs to an hypoxic environment (1% O2). The experimental groups were labelled as: sham (untreated cells), ciPTECs cultured in serum containing medium; vehicle (serum-starved cells), ciPTECs cultured in SFM; and ischemia, ciPTECs exposed to AA and 2DG in SFM and under normoxia (1% O2) or hypoxia (1% O2).</p><p><br></p><p>Afterwards, ischemic cells were washed once with Hank\u2019s balanced salt solution (HBSS;Gibco, Life Technologies) to remove AA and 2DG before being treated with mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) secretome, either as conditioned medium (CM) or EVs (small, SEV; and large, LEV)<strong>[6]</strong> from each of the MSCs sources for an additional 24h at 37 \u00b0C (reproducing&nbsp;the reperfusion phase). To calculate the therapeutic dose of MSC-bioproducts, the volume of CM and number EV-particles generated were normalised to the total of cell number harvested after the collection. When collecting MSC bioproducts for both the secretome and the EVs, the generating MSCs were harvested and counted to calculate the cell-equivalent concentration of the secretome and EVs. This was used to enable the comparison of the effects exerted by both bioproducts under cell-equivalent doses. Based on previous studies reported in the literature<strong>[11][12]</strong>, we administered the amount of bioproduct equivalent obtained from 2 MSCs per each ciPTEC in serum-free medium (SFM; ratio 2:1; MSC by-product:ciPTEC).</p><p><br></p><p>To effectively assess the efficacy of MSC secretome in mitigating ischemic damage, we established a comparative analysis. On one hand, we exposed ischemic ciPTECs to MSC secretome in SFM, to allow us the study of the specific effects of the secretome. On the other hand, we subjected ischemic ciPTECs to serum-containing medium, replicating the conditions in which blood flow is reintroduced post-ischemia (labelled as 'reperfusion' group). By comparing the effects of MSC secretome treatment under serum-free conditions with those in a reperfusion-like setting, we aimed to gain insights into the potential benefits of the secretome.</p><p><br></p><p>Note: U-CM: conditioned medium from umbilical cord; U-MV: microvesicles from umbilical cord; U-EX: extracellular vesicles from umbilical cord; B-CM: conditioned medium from bone marrow; B-MV: microvesicles from bone marrow; B-EX: extracellular vesicles from bone marrow; A-CM: conditioned medium from adipose tissue; A-MV: microvesicles from adipose tissue; A-EX: extracellular vesicles from adipose tissue.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Wilmer MJ, Saleem MA, Masereeuw R, Ni L, van der Velden TJ, Russel FG, Mathieson PW, Monnens LA, van den Heuvel LP, Levtchenko EN.
