                "description": "<p>Acute lung injury (ALI) is a lung disease characterized by an excessive inflammatory response and damage to lung epithelial cells. Atractylodin (ATL) is the main active component of Atractylodes lancea (Thunb.) DC., which has good anti-inflammatory activity and protects the integrity of the epithelial cell barrier. However, the efficacy of ATL in the treatment of ALI and its mechanism are unclear. We investigated the efficacy of ATL in treating ALI in vivo and in vitro, and explored its targets and mechanisms of action from metabolic and signaling pathways. The results showed that, in vivo, ATL significantly reduced the wet-dry ratio of lungs of rats with ALI, improved the pathological changes, reduced the aggregation and activation of neutrophils and macrophages in the lungs, and lowered the expression of the inflammatory factors, MCP-1, and MPO. The transcriptomics results suggested that ATL exerts its therapeutic effects by modulating the HIF-1 signaling pathway and metabolic processes. Metabolomics results showed that ATL mainly affected the processes of lactose degradation and galactose metabolism. Combined metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses showed that ASAH3L, a gene related to galactose metabolism, was regulated by ATL, and further experiments demonstrated that ATL reduced the expression of ASAH3L and ROS thereby inhibiting the activation of the HIF-1 signaling pathway. Overexpression of ASAH3L reversed the therapeutic effect of ATL in rats with ALI. In conclusion, ATL can reduce inflammation by inhibiting activating the HIF-1 signaling pathway and targeting ASAH3L to regulate galactose metabolism, thereby alleviating ALI.</p>",

All rats were kept in animal rooms with suitable temperatures, with adequate sterile water and food, light for 12 h and darkness for 12 h per day. All experimental procedures were in accordance with ethical requirements and approved by the Ethics Committee of Hubei University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (Approval No. NO.00272049, November 9, 2022). A total of 60 rats were randomly distributed into 5 groups: control, model, ATL (10 mg/kg), ATL (40 mg/kg) and Dex (5 mg/kg), with 12 rats in each group. After acclimatization feeding for 3 days, each dosing group was administered the corresponding drug by gavage for 7 days, while the control group and model group received the same dose of solvent. After 7 days of gavage, all groups except the control group were subjected to a tracheal drip of LPS (5 mg/kg) to induce ALI46. After 6 h, the rats were euthanized with sodium pentobarbital. Lung tissues and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were then collected and stored for further use. The ATL standard was dissolved by sonication with 5% DMSO, 30% PEG300, 10% Tween 80 and 55% double-distilled water.</p>",
