                "description": "<p>The uptake and accumulation of nanoplastics by plants have raised particular concerns. However, molecular mechanisms underlying nanoplastic phytotoxicity are still vague and insufficient. Thus, its potential environmental risks and biosafety are receiving increased attention. In this study, cucumber plants were exposed to polystyrene nanoplastics (PSNPs) under different concentration. The results demonstrated that phenotypic parameters (total photosynthetic pigment content, relative membrane permeability, total phenolic content, and lipid peroxidation) were not significantly affected. However, metabolomic and transcriptomic analysis revealed that both doses of PSNPs induced the expression regulation of different key genes, exhibiting considerable distinction on metabolic responses in cucumber. The high dose of PSNPs induced stronger alteration in cucumber leaves than low dose of PSNPs. Low dose exposure significantly affected four metabolic pathways involved in the carbohydrate metabolism. High dose exposure significantly affected five metabolic pathways involved in the carbohydrate metabolism and four metabolic pathways involved in the amino acid metabolism. These findings shed new light on the phytotoxic mechanism and environmental implication behind the interaction of nanoplastics and plants, and advance our understanding of the potential adverse effect induced by the presence of nanoplastics in agricultural systems.</p>",

Then, data were imported into software MS-DIAL, which performs peak detection, peak identification, MS2Dec deconvolution, characterization, peak alignment, wave filtering, and missing value interpolation. Metabolite characterization is based on LUG database. A data matrix was derived. The three-dimensional matrix includes: sample information, the name of the peak of each substance, retention time, retention index, mass-to-charge ratio, and signal intensity. In each sample, all peak signal intensities were segmented and normalized according to the internal standards with RSD greater than 0.3 after screening. After the data was normalized, redundancy removal and peak merging were conducted to obtain the data matrix. The matrix was imported in R to carry out Principle Component Analysis (PCA) to observe the overall distribution among the samples and the stability of the whole analysis process. Orthogonal Partial Least-Squares-Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA) and Partial Least-Squares-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) were utilized to distinguish the metabolites that differ between groups. To prevent overfitting, 7-fold cross-validation and 200 Response Permutation Testing (RPT) were used to evaluate the quality of the model. Variable Importance of Projection (VIP) values obtained from the OPLS-DA model were used to rank the overall contribution of each variable to group discrimination. A two-tailed Student\u2019s T-test was further used to verify whether the metabolites of difference between groups were significant. Differential metabolites were selected with VIP values greater than 1.0 and p-values less than 0.05.</p>",
