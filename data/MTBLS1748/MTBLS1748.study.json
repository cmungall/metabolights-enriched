                "description": "<p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> Fusarium head blight (FHB) is a serious fungal disease of crop plants due to substantial yield reduction and production of mycotoxins in the infected grains. The breeding progress in increasing resistance with maintaining a high yield is not possible without a thorough examination of the molecular basis of plant immunity responses.</p><p><strong>METHODS:</strong> LC-MS based metabolomics approaches powered by three-way ANOVA and differentially accumulated metabolites (DAMs) selection, correlation network and functional enrichment were conducted on grains of resistant and susceptible to FHB genotypes of barley and wheat as well as model grass Brachypodium distachyon (Bd) still poorly known at metabolomic level.</p><p><strong>RESULTS:</strong> We selected common and genotype-specific DAMs in response to F. culmorum inoculation. Immunological reaction at metabolomic level was strongly diversified between resistant and susceptible genotypes. DAMs common for all tested species from porphyrins, flavonoids and phenylpropanoids metabolic pathways were highly correlated and reflects conservativeness in FHB response in Poaceae family. Resistant related DAMs belonged to different structural classes including tryptophan derived metabolites, pirimidines, amino acids proline and serine as well as phenylpropanoids and flavonoids. Physiological response to F. culmorum of Bd was close to barley and wheat genotypes however, metabolomic changes were strongly diversified. </p><p><strong>CONCLUSIONS:</strong> Combined targeted and untargeted metabolomics provides comprehensive knowledge about significant elements of plant immunity with potential of being molecular biomarkers of enhance resistance to FHB in grass family. Thorough examination of Bd21 metabolome in juxtaposition with barley and wheat diversified genotypes facilitate their setting as model grass for plant-microbe interaction.</p>",

For simplicity, genotypes with high susceptibility to FHB are hereafter referred to as susceptible, whereas genotypes with reduced susceptibility to FHB will be referred to as resistant, although in fact their resistance is not complete.</p><p><br></p><p>Plants were cultivated in the phytotron of the Plant Cultivation Center of the Institute of Plant Genetics, Polish Academy of Sciences, Poland, Poznan. Barley genotypes came from recombinant inbred lines of Hordeum vulgare MCam, obtained from the cross between the Polish cultivar Lubuski and a Syrian breeding line-Cam/B1/CI08887//CI05761\u2014selected from the materials of the Institute of Plant Genetics, Polish Academy of Sciences on the basis of previous studies<strong>[1]</strong>. 2 extremely different lines of barley-the MCam 88 line (hereafter referred to as Hs) and the resistant MCam 59 line (hereafter referred to as Hr), were taken for metabolomic analysis. The sensitive cultivar Radocha<strong>[2]</strong> (hereafter referred to as Ts) and the highly resistant line CJ 9306<strong>[3]</strong> (hereafter referred to as Tr) of wheat were obtained from Breeding Company Strzelce, Poland. The Bd21 line was provided by the National Plant Germplasm System of USDA-ARS.</p><p><br></p><p>Seeds were surface-sterilized by soaking them in 2.5% sodium hypochlorite for 30 min, then washed thoroughly in sterile deionized water. The seeds were sown into pots of 30 cm in diameter filled with soil in growth chambers. During the first month, plants were grown under short-day conditions (10 h light, 14 h dark) at 16 \u00b0C and then switched to long-day conditions (16 h light, 8 h dark) at a temperature of 21 \u00b0C in the light/14 \u00b0C in the dark with a humidity of 60% of RH for the acceleration of flowering. Plants were grown in 2 principal experiments.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Inoculation:</strong></p><p>An inoculation was performed with the fungus <em>F. culmorum</em> isolate KF846 from the collection of the Institute of Plant Genetics, Polish Academy of Sciences. In order to prepare the spore suspension, spores were washed from the surface of a 2-wk-old colony growing on PDA medium (Potato, Dextrose, Agar, Oxoid). The inoculation was carried out at the concentration of 10^6 spores/ml.</p><p><br></p><p>The inoculation with fungal spores was carried out in the flowering stage of the spikes (at stage 61 of the BBCH scale) by spraying. For barley and wheat, this was carried out at approx. 8 wk, and for Bd21, 12 wk from sowing. After inoculation for 24 h, the plants were kept in the dark with mist irrigation to increase the efficiency of infection. For metabolomic analysis, samples were collected 4 and 6 d after inoculation. For antioxidant and mycotoxin analysis, samples were collected 6 d after inoculation. All collected samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored in \u221280 \u00b0C until assays.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Ogrodowicz P, Kuczy\u0144ska A, Miko\u0142ajczak K, Adamski T, Surma M, Krajewski P, \u0106wiek-Kupczy\u0144ska H, Kempa M, Rokicki M, Jasi\u0144ska D.
