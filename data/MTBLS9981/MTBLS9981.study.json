                "description": "<p>The metabolism of bacteria is closely associated with antibiotic resistance, yet the role of metabolism in the resistance of Helicobacter pylori remains unclear. In this study, we conducted integrated analysis using transcriptomics and non-targeted metabolomics to investigate the metabolic changes of antibiotic-treated H. pylori. The results revealed an upregulation in the expression of genes related to fatty acid biosynthesis. Inhibiting fatty acid biosynthesis significantly enhanced the sensitivity of H. pylori&nbsp;strains sensitive to antibiotics, artificially selected multidrug-resistant strains, and clinically multidrug-resistant strains, leading to the inability to form intact biofilms. Furthermore, we explored the reasons for the enhanced fatty acid synthesis in H. pylori&nbsp;under antibiotic pressure and found that antibiotic treatment induced a stringent response in H. pylori, activating the regulation of the downstream operon containing hp0560&nbsp;by \u03c328, thereby enhancing the fatty acid synthesis pathway and consequently increasing H. pylori's tolerance to various antibiotics. In this study, we identified a novel mechanism by which H. pylori&nbsp;adapts to antibiotic pressure.</p>",

                        "description": "<p>The original LC-MS data were processed by software Progenesis QI V2.3 (Nonlinear, Dynamics, Newcastle, UK) for baseline filtering, peak identification, integral, retention time correction, peak alignment, and normalization. Main parameters of 5 ppm precursor tolerance, 10 ppm product tolerance, and 5% product ion threshold were applied. Compound identification were based on precise mass-to-charge ratio (M/z), secondary fragments, and isotopic distribution using The Human Metabolome Database (HMDB), Lipidmaps (V2.3), Metlin, EMDB, PMDB, and self-built databases to do qualitative analysis. </p><p>The extracted data were then further processed by removing any peaks with a missing value (ion intensity = 0) in more than 50% in groups, by replacing zero value by half of the minimum value, and by screening according to the qualitative results of the compound. Compounds with resulting scores below 36 (out of 60) points were also deemed to be inaccurate and removed. A data matrix was combined from the positive and negative ion data. </p><p>The matrix was imported in R to carry out Principle Component Analysis (PCA) to observe the overall distribution among the samples and the stability of the whole analysis process. Orthogonal Partial Least-Squares-Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA) and Partial Least-Squares-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) were utilized to distinguish the metabolites that differ between groups. To prevent overfitting, 7-fold cross-validation and 200 Response Permutation Testing (RPT) were used to evaluate the quality of the model. </p><p>Variable Importance of Projection (VIP) values obtained from the OPLS-DA model were used to rank the overall contribution of each variable to group discrimination. A two-tailed Student\u2019s T-test was further used to verify whether the metabolites of difference between groups were significant. Differential metabolites were selected with VIP values greater than 1.0 and p-values less than 0.05.</p>",
