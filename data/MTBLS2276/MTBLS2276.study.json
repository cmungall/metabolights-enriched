                "description": "<h4><strong>INTRODUCTION: </strong>Wheat (<em>Triticum aestivum</em>) it is one of the most important staple food crops worldwide and represents an important resource for human nutrition. Besides starch, proteins and micronutrients wheat grains accumulate a highly diverse set of phytochemicals.</h4><h4><strong>OBJECTIVES: </strong>This work aimed at the development and validation of an analytical workflow for comprehensive profiling of semi-polar phytochemicals in whole wheat grains.</h4><h4><strong>METHOD: </strong>Reversed-phase ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC/ESI-QTOFMS) was used as analytical platform. For annotation of metabolites accurate mass collision-induced dissociation mass spectra were acquired and interpreted in conjunction with literature data, database queries and analyses of reference compounds.</h4><h4><strong>RESULTS: </strong>Based on reversed-phase UHPLC/ESI-QTOFMS an analytical workflow for comprehensive profiling of semi-polar phytochemicals in whole wheat grains was developed. For method development the extraction procedure and the chromatographic separation were optimized. Using whole grains of eight wheat cultivars a total of 248 metabolites were annotated and characterized by chromatographic and tandem mass spectral data. Annotated metabolites comprise hydroquinones, hydroxycinnamic acid amides, flavonoids, benzoxazinoids, lignans and other phenolics as well as numerous primary metabolites such as nucleosides, amino acids and derivatives, organic acids, saccharides and B vitamin derivatives. For method validation, recovery rates and matrix effects were determined for ten exogenous model compounds. Repeatability and linearity were assessed for 39 representative endogenous metabolites. In addition, the accuracy of relative quantification was evaluated for six exogenous model compounds.</h4><h4><strong>CONCLUSIONS: </strong>In conjunction with non-targeted and targeted data analysis strategies the developed analytical workflow was successfully applied to discern differences in the profiles of semi-polar phytochemicals accumulating in whole grains of eight wheat cultivars.</h4>",

The mass spectrometer was operated in low mass range (m/z 1700) and extended dynamic range (2 GHz) mode. The slicer mode was set to high sensitivity. Using these settings, the mass resolution (full width at half maximum) at m/z 922 was approximately 23,000. The instrument was auto tuned and calibrated according to manufacturer\u00b4s recommendations using ESI-L tuning mix (Agilent Technologies). MassHunter LC/MS Data Acquisition software was used for controlling the instrument and data acquisition. Mass spectra were acquired from m/z 80-1700 in centroid mode using an acquisition rate of 2 spectra/s. The following instrument settings were applied for positive (negative) ion mode: nebulizer gas, nitrogen, 35 psig; dry gas, nitrogen, 200 \u00b0C, 18 L/min; sheath gas, nitrogen, 300 \u00b0C, 12 L/min; capillary voltage -3000 V (3000 V); nozzle voltage 0 V (0 V); high pressure funnel, voltage drop 200 V, RF voltage 150 V; low pressure funnel, voltage drop 100 V, RF voltage 100 V; funnel exit DC 50 V; octopole RF voltage 750 V; collision gas, nitrogen; collision energy 0 V.</p><p><br></p><p>Collision-induced dissociation (CID) mass spectra were acquired in targeted-MS/MS mode using scheduled precursor ion lists and the following parameters: acquisition rate MS, 3 spectra/s; acquisition rate MS/MS, 3 spectra/s, isolation width, narrow (1.3 m/z); collision energy, 10\u201360 V; collision gas, nitrogen. For acquisition of CID mass spectra of in-source fragment ions (pseudo-MS3) funnel exit DC voltage was increased to 120 V.</p><p><br></p><p>LC/MS data acquisition was carried out in analytical batches with a maximum of 95 samples (~33 h of instrument time). To correct for systematic instrumental drift within and between analytical batches a quality control (QC) sample approach was applied. For this purpose, a pooled QC sample was prepared by mixing aliquots of all biological samples to be analyzed within the frame of an experiment. Analytical batches were structured as follows: 7 QC samples at the beginning, 2o QC samples at the end and in-between segments of 4 randomly selected samples which were bracketed by 2 QC samples. Instrument maintenance (cleaning of the ion source and the LC column, instrument tuning, mass calibration) was performed at the beginning of each analytical batch. In case multiple analytical batches have to be analyzed consecutively in the frame of an experiment, maintenance operations between analytical batches were restricted to LC column cleaning and mass calibration.</p>",
