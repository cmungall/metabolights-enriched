                "description": "<p>Aquatic insects are well-adapted to freshwater environments, but metabolic mechanisms of such adaptations, particularly to primary environmental factors (e.g., hypoxia, water pressure, dark light and abundant microbes), are poorly known. Most firefly species (Coleoptera: Lampyridae) are terrestrial, but the larvae of a few species are aquatic. We generated 24 global metabolomic profiles of larvae and adults of <em>Aquatica leii</em> (freshwater) and <em>Lychnuris praetexta</em> (terrestrial) to identify freshwater adaptation-related metabolites (AARMs). We identified 110 differentially abundant metabolites (DAMs) in <em>A. leii</em> (adults vs aquatic larvae) and 183 DAMs in <em>L. praetexta</em> (adults vs terrestrial larvae). Furthermore, 100 DAMs specific to aquatic <em>A. leii</em> larvae were screened as AARMs via interspecific comparisons (<em>A. leii</em> vs <em>L. praetexta</em>), which were primarily involved in antioxidant activity, immune response, energy production and metabolism, and chitin biosynthesis. They were assigned to six categories/superclasses (e.g., lipids and lipid-like molecules, organic acids and derivatives, and organoheterocyclic compound). Finally, ten metabolic pathways shared between KEGG terms specific to aquatic fireflies and enriched by AARMs were screened as aquatic adaptation-related pathways (AARPs). These AARPs were primarily involved in energy metabolism, xenobiotic biodegradation, protection of oxidative/immune damage, oxidative stress response and sense function (e.g., glycine, serine and threonine metabolism, drug metabolism-cytochrome P450 and taste transduction), and certain aspects of morphology (e.g., steroid hormone biosynthesis). These results provide evidence suggesting that abundance changes in metabolomes contribute to freshwater adaptation of fireflies. The metabolites identified here may be vital targets for future work to determine the mechanism of freshwater adaptation in insects.</p>",

                        "description": "<p>The raw data were converted into the <strong>mzXML</strong> format by using <strong>ProteoWizard</strong>, and processed using <strong>R</strong> package <strong>XCMS</strong> (version 3.2) for peak detection, extraction, alignment and integration, as previously described<strong>[1][2]</strong>. The software generated a data matrix for the raw data, including sample information, retention time (RT), mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) values and peak intensity. Metabolic features that were detected at least in 70% of samples were retained. After filtering, minimum metabolite values were assessed for samples in which the metabolite levels fell below the lower limit of quantitation. Peak annotation was carried out using <strong>Compound Discover</strong> v3.0 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and <strong>OSI-SMMS</strong> v1.0 (software system for rapid identification and analysis of small molecular compounds in metabolomics; Dalian Chem Data Solution Information Technology, Dalian, China), integrated with the database <strong>mzcloud</strong> (HighChem LLC, Bratislava, Slovakia). An internal standard was used for data QC (reproducibility). Metabolic features with relative standard deviation (RSD) of QC &gt; 30% were discarded. Following normalization procedures and imputation, statistical analysis was performed on log-transformed data to identify significant differences in metabolite levels between comparable groups. Subsequently, acquired MS/MS spectra were matched against metabolome databases including <strong>HMDB</strong> (<strong>Human Metabolome Database</strong>, <a href='https://hmdb.ca/' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>https://hmdb.ca/</a>), <strong>KEGG</strong> (<strong>Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes</strong>, <a href='https://www.genome.jp/kegg/' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>https://www.genome.jp/kegg/</a>) and an in-house MS/MS database (Biotree Biotech Co., Ltd. Shanghai, China). The MS/MS spectra match score was calculated using a dot-product algorithm and ranged from 0 to 1. The cutoff for match score was set as 0.4. The data were normalized by the internal standards before statistical analysis. The Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated between each sample pair to evaluate the repeatability of the biological replicates. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed to separate and classify the sample groups based on metabolic profiles using <strong>SIMCA-P+</strong> software v16 (Sartorius Stedim Data Analytics AB, Umea, Sweden).</p><p><br></p><p>The significance of each DAM between larvae and adults of each firefly species was evaluated using unpaired Wilcoxon tests. The p-values were further corrected by the Benjamini-Hochberg adjustment method (false discovery rate, FDR &lt; 0.05), abosolute log2FC(fold change) &gt; 1 and VIP (the variable importance of projection) &gt; 2. The metabolites involved in freshwater adaptation of larval <em>A. leii</em> were detected as previously described<strong>[3]</strong>. Briefly, the DAMs of <em>L. praetexta</em> were intersected with that of <em>A. leii</em>, thus excluding non-responding metabolites to fresh water in larval <em>A. leii</em>. Subsequently, DAMs that were only detected in <em>A. leii</em> (<em>A. leii</em> specific DAMs) were retained as metabolites that presented abundance changes to freshwater environments; these metabolites were identified as aquatic adaptation-related metabolites (AARMs) in <em>A. leii</em> larvae.</p><p><br></p><p>According to the <strong>HMDB</strong> database annotation information, AARMs were divided and assigned to 3 levels: superclass, class and subclass. In addition, the identified differential metabolites were further analyzed to determine the relevant biological pathways using <strong>MetaboAnalyst 5.0</strong> (<a href='https://www.metaboanalyst.ca/' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>https://www.metaboanalyst.ca/</a>). Benjamini-Hochberg adjustment was employed as the FDR correction method. To detect reliable <strong>KEGG</strong> pathways specifically involved in freshwater adaptation of larval <em>A. leii</em>, 2 methods (i.e., DAM-KEGG-intersection and AARM-KEGG) were used, as previously described<strong>[3]</strong>. In the DAM-KEGG-intersection method DAMs of <em>L. praetexta</em> and <em>A. leii</em> were subjected to <strong>KEGG</strong> enrichment analysis, their results were intersected and the pathways specific to <em>A. leii</em> were obtained. In the AARM-KEGG method, the AARMs above obtained were directly used for <strong>KEGG</strong> enrichment. The results shared by both methods were considered as the final <strong>KEGG</strong> metabolic pathways associated with freshwater adaptation of <em>A. leii</em> (namely, aquatic adaptation-related pathways, AARPs).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Fu XH, Wang YY, Lei CL.
