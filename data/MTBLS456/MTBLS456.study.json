A test mix of Acetominophen, Sulfaguanidine, Sulfadimethoxine, Val-Tyr-Val, Verapmil, Terfenadine, Leucine-Enkephalin, Reserpine and Erythromycin was injected to ensure calibration of mass spectrometer mass accuracy and UPLC performance prior to analysis. Pooled samples (comprising a 10 \u03bcl aliquot from all study samples) were injected 5 times before the start of each run for column conditioning[1] and intermittently throughout the run to validate instrument performance. The run-order of samples entering the mass spectrometer was constructed using a randomized sample list comprising 5 technical replicates per biological sample. No other samples were injected during the analysis run. 8 \u03bcl of prepared sample extracts were injected onto an Acquity UPLC HSS-T3 column (100 mm x 2.1 mm i.d., 1.8 \u03bcm; Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA). Column and autosampler temperature were maintained at 50 \u00b0C and 10 \u00b0C respectively. Chromatographic separation was carried out at a flow rate of 600 \u03bcl/min with mobile phase consisting of 99.9% H2O/0.1% formic acid (A) and 99.9% acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid (B). The elution gradient was as follows: 0\u20132 min isocratic at 1% of B, 2\u201314.5 min linear gradient form 1\u2013100% of B, 14.5\u201317.5 min isocratic at 100% of B, and finally 17.5\u201320 min linear gradient at 100\u20131% of B.\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Want EJ, Wilson ID, Gika H, Theodoridis G, Plumb RS, Shockcor J, Holmes E, Nicholson JK.

The XIC window for data collection was 0.2 Da and apex peak tracking parameters were set to automatic with no smoothing. Data collection parameters consisted of an intensity threshold (counts) of 500, a mass window of 0.02 Da with a retention time window of 0.20 min. A noise elimination level of 6 was applied and isotopes were removed. Peak heights for extracted ions were normalized against the total peak height of all extracted ions and standardized to a total ion count of 10,000.\n</p>\nThe results were exported in .csv format as a 2-dimensional data table in which rows and columns respectively represented analysed samples and the relative normalized peak heights of each detected mass spectrometric signal, i.e. as an Accurate Mass (m/z) and Retention Time (min) Pair (AMRTP). Extracted and processed data submitted for downstream multivariate and statistical analysis for metabolite marker selection can be found in supplementary data (see Table S4 of the paper associate with this study).",

Mass uncertainty was set to 3 mDa, odd and even electron state, carbon isotope filter of +/- 5% and elements included were C, H, O, N, P and S. Where applicable Na and K adduct elemental composition were determined with the respective element included in the analysis parameters. Elemental compositions were searched against PubChem and Chemspider online databases, and where possible Function 2 fragments were matched against Metlin, HMDB or Massbank databases. Where fragmentation spectra for the analyte in question was not available, in silico fragmentation was performed using Metfrag and Function 2 fragmentation data was validated against potential in silico fragments. Identified compounds were validated using mass spectrum and retention time relative to authentic analytical standards analysed under identical experimental conditions (see Fig. S4 of the paper associate with this study). Pooled plasma samples and individual analytical standards (1 \u03bcM) were analysed under identical UPLC and mass spectrometric run conditions as utilized previously[1], and metabolite identities confirmed by matching retention time and Function 1 and Function 2 spectra (including low and high energy fragments and adducts). Putative annotations were acquired for compounds with spectral similarity to public spectral libraries (Metlin, HMCB or Massbank).\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Gray DW, Welsh MD, Doherty S, Mansoor F, Chevallier OP, Elliott CT, Mooney MH.
