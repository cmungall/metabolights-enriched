                "description": "<p>Subspecies of the protozoan parasite <em>Trypanosoma brucei</em> are the causative agents of Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT), a debilitating neglected tropical disease prevalent across sub-Saharan Africa. HAT case numbers have steadily decreased since the start of the century, and sustainable elimination of one form of the disease is in sight. However, key to this is the development of novel drugs to combat the disease. Acoziborole is a recently developed benzoxaborole, currently in advanced clinical trials, for treatment of stage 1 and stage 2 HAT. Importantly, acoziborole is orally bioavailable, and curative with one dose. Recent studies have made significant progress in determining the molecular mode of action of acoziborole. However, less is known about the potential mechanisms leading to acoziborole resistance in trypanosomes. In this study, an <em>in vitro</em> derived acoziborole-resistant (AcoR) cell line was generated and characterised. The AcoR line exhibited significant cross-resistance with the methyltransferase inhibitor sinefungin as well as hypersensitisation to known trypanocides. Interestingly, transcriptomics analysis of AcoR cells indicated the parasites had obtained a procyclic- or stumpy-like transcriptome profile, with upregulation of procyclin surface proteins as well as differential regulation of key metabolic genes known to be expressed in a life cycle-specific manner, even in the absence of major morphological changes. However, no changes were observed in transcripts encoding CPSF3, the recently identified protein target of acoziborole. The results suggest that generation of resistance to this novel compound <em>in vitro</em> can be accompanied by transcriptomic switches resembling a procyclic- or stumpy-type phenotype.</p>",

Cells were cultured in HMI-11 (supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum) and maintained at 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO2. Cultures were maintained at densities between 2 x 10^4 and 2 x 10^6 cells/mL. <em>In vitro</em> resistance to <strong>acoziborole</strong> was initiated by maintaining cells in 170 nM of the compound, which was deemed the highest concentration wild-type cells could tolerate long term. Once a cell line was established in this concentration, cells were then transferred to 6 wells of a 24-well plate at a density of 1 x 10^5 cells/mL. Altogether 6 incrementing concentrations of <strong>acoziborole</strong> were then added, to obtain 6 x 2 mL cultures. Typically, increments of 0.2 \u00b5M were used, and cells were incubated at 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO2. Cells were routinely observed by microscopy and after &gt;2 wk, live confluent cells in the highest concentration of <strong>acoziborole</strong> were cultured for 2 passages in the same concentration of the benzoxaborole, before transfer to 6 new wells in a 24-well plate, from which point the process was repeated using the new <strong>acoziborole</strong> concentration as a starting point. A wild-type cell line was grown in the absence of drug as a \u201chighly-passaged\u201d control, in order to detect transcriptome changes related to <em>in vitro</em> culture adaptation. Once sufficient resistance was deemed to have been generated, cells were cloned by dilution and 4 isolates were recovered.</p><p><br></p><p>To probe changes in the <strong>acoziborole</strong>-resistant (AcoR) cells, as a result of induced resistance to the benzoxaborole, LC-MS was carried out on cell pellets to compare wild-type <em>T. brucei</em> to two AcoR clones, both in the presence and absence (cultured without drug for 48 h, or 1 passage) of <strong>acoziborole</strong> resulting in 6 sample groups (4 replicates per sample group).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Cross GA, Manning JC.

Supernatant was poured off and cells resuspended in the remaining supernatant. Samples were then transferred to a 1.5 mL eppendorf tube prior to another centrifugation step at 1500 x g for 5 min. Remaining supernatant was carefully removed, and the cells resuspended in 200 \u00b5L extraction solvent. All samples, including a blank and fresh medium control, were then left on a shaker for 1 h. Subsequently, samples were centrifuged at 16,060 x g for 10 min, and the supernatant was transferred to a 2 mL screw-top tube. A quality control sample was generated by pooling together 10 \u00b5L from each sample. Finally, air was displaced with argon gas and samples were stored at -80 \u00b0C until they were analysed by LC-MS.</p>",
