                "description": "<p>Chemical pollution is a major concern for freshwater ecosystems, but the impact and mechanisms of chemical stressors on communities are barely understood. Pollution stress beyond natural homeostatic capacities can trigger succession of tolerant species within a community, enhancing the overall community tolerance. This process was operationalized in the Pollution-Induced Community Tolerance (PICT) concept and applied in many case studies, however, the molecular mechanisms of community tolerance and implications for ecological functions remain largely unexplored. Our study aimed to demonstrate that 1) community metabolomics can unravel potential mechanisms of PICT in periphyton and 2) induced tolerance helps to maintain primary production under re-occuring pollution. To this end, we grew periphyton for 5\u202fweeks with and without the model herbicide diuron in microcosms, quantified PICT, and determined the related metabolic fingerprint of periphyton by GC\u2013MS-based untargeted metabolomics. Further, we explored the autotrophic community based on pigment composition and functional parameters including photosynthesis and gross primary production. Chronic diuron exposure resulted in a shift in pigment composition, higher community tolerance and an individual metabolic fingerprint in the contaminated communities. </p><p>Opposing responses of selected metabolites during a short-term exposure indicated differences in diuron pre-adaptation in the different communities. Metabolites (threonic acid and two sugar acid lactones) were found to be related to tolerance development, suggesting that ascorbate metabolism was induced in contaminated communities. Despite these compensating mechanism, contaminated communities were compromised in production-to-respiration ratio and biomass. A ranking of sensitivity thresholds of different biological endpoints revealed that metabolites were less sensitive than photosynthetic parameters, which reflects the mode-of-action of the herbicide. In conclusion, we could demonstrate that community metabolomics is able to unravel complex biochemical changes and allows mechanistic insights into community tolerance. </p><p>Moreover, we were able to show that induced community tolerance was insufficient to safeguard functions like primary production.</p>",

The glass slide holder had varying spatial position (up, mid and low), which were approximately 10, 13 and 16 cm below water surface. Biofilms were grown for 5 wk, and half of the glass tanks were contaminated with 4 \u00b5g/L <strong>diuron</strong>, starting from the second week of cultivation. Water was stirred permanently and exchanged weekly to guarantee sufficient supply of nutrients and a near-natural inoculum of species. The exposure concentration of <strong>diuron</strong> was renewed after each water exchange and monitored before and after <strong>diuron</strong> addition on a QTRAP 6500 LC-MS/MS System. Oxygen saturation, pH and temperature were monitored at each water exchange. Water temperature was maintained at 22\u00b11 \u00b0C and the light cycle was set to 14/10 h light/dark cycle. The photon yield of the LED plant lamps (C-series, Valoya, Helsinki, Finland) above the water surface was approximately 150 \u00b5mol photons m^2/s.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Detection Phase </strong></p><p>After the selection phase the slides were randomly sampled from the different tanks at varying spatial position (up, mid and low) to avoid a spatial bias in the microbial community. The slides were exposed for a second time in 500 mL petri dishes and each concentration was duplicated, while controls were triplicated. The <strong>diuron</strong> exposure solution was equilibrated for 30 min prior to biofilm addition and then an aliquot for exposure monitoring was taken. Light and temperature parameters of the second exposure were kept consistent with the settings of the selection phase using a phytotron (MultitronPro, IFORS, Einsbach, Germany). Petri dishes were slightly agitated at 30 rpm and illuminated by LEDs. After 1 h of exposure the slides were sampled by transferring them 50 mL falcon tubes. The tubes were immediately quenched in liquid nitrogen and stored until extraction at -80 \u00b0C.</p>",

Then 150 mg of glass beads (5 mm) and 1.2 mL of a solvent mixture containing methanol, chloroform and water (10:5:4, v/v/v) and ribitol as internal standard (10 mg/L) was added to each sample. Cells were disrupted using a FastPrep\u00ae-24 (MP Biomedicals, USA) for 35 s in 3 cycles, while the samples were cooled down for 2 min after each run. Cell debris were centrifuged (6 min, 6 \u00b0C, 20000 x g, rotor 12148) and 1 mL of the supernatant, 0.8 mL milli-Q water and 1.6 mL chloroform were transferred into a 10 mL glass tube. The hydrophilic and lipophilic metabolites were separated by vortexing and a subsequent centrifugation step (10 min, 5 \u00b0C, 4000 x g, rotor). A total of 1 mL of the upper hydrophilic methanol/water (polar) phase was transferred into a 3 mL reaction glass vial and dried at 40 \u00b0C and gentle nitrogen circulation. The dried sample was incubated with 200 \u00b5L MOXTM reagent (2% methoxyamine x HCl in pyridine) for 2 h at 80 \u00b0C. The methoxaminated samples were dried the same way as before, 100 \u00b5L of MSTFA reagent was added and they were incubated at 90 \u00b0C for 20 min. Process blanks were included in the metabolite extraction and derivatization step to account and subtract the background contamination. After derivatization a pool sample (QC sample) from all individual samples was created by pooling 10 \u00b5L of each sample. Then the samples were subjected to a gas chromatograph coupled to a time-of-flight mass spectrometer (GC-TOFMS).&nbsp;</p>",

The alignment table was corrected, filtered, normalized, aggregated, transformed and visualized. First the alignment was quality checked for peaks that were divided into different alignment ID\u2019s. Those peaks were merged if the EI spectrum similarity was above 80%, the retention time gap was below 8 s and the conflict between the aligned metabolites was below 5%. In total 57 of the 1354 aligned peaks were merged with their corresponding counterpart to correct for peak splitting in the alignment routine. The dataset was filtered for artifacts, which were introduced by the <strong>MS-DIAL</strong> alignment (automatically interpolated peak areas) and sporadically occurring peaks. To this end data were filtered for consistency by requiring a peak to occur at a minimum of 30% in the replicates of 3 subsequent treatments. The filtering revealed 601 sporadic peaks which were removed. In a last filtering step the blank contamination was removed by setting a 5-fold threshold, which the mean peak area must exceed compared to the blank mean. The blank filtering step further reduced the dataset to a final selection of 190 metabolites, which were normalized to the internal standard ribitol. Then, the replicates of each exposure treatment were aggregated to a mean value, since they covered the different slide positions (up, mid and low) during cultivation. Finally, the aggregated data was mean centered and auto-scaled for the principal component analysis.</p>",
