                "description": "This study investigates lipid dysregulation in calcific aortic valve stenosis (CAVS) by analyzing lipid profiles in valve tissues from 99 patients across different disease severities (mild, moderate, severe) using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). The results reveal distinct lipid alterations that correspond to disease progression, with significant correlations between diacylglycerol (DG) and alkyl lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC(O)) levels and key markers of valve stiffness, such as peak aortic jet velocity and mean pressure gradient. Unique lipid profiles, marked by elevated cholesteryl esters and triacylglycerols, were identified in fast-progressing cases. Additionally, plasma lipids TG 52:4 and TG 54:4 emerged as promising non-invasive diagnostic markers, surpassing traditional markers in diagnostic performance. This study highlights the potential of specific lipidomic pathways as therapeutic targets in CAVS, given the current lack of effective pharmacological treatments.",

In total 10 \u00b5L of the tissue homogenate or blood plasma were added to a microcentrifuge tube (Eppendorf). Then, 200 \u00b5L of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) and 30 \u00b5L of lipid internal standards (ISTD) in chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v) combination were added. After 10 min of vortexing on a rotary mixer, the mixture was sonicated for 30 min at room temperature in a water bath. After letting the mixture settle for 20 min, it was spun at 20,000 x g for 20 min at room temperature. The lipid-rich top phase was moved to a fresh microcentrifuge tube and allowed to evaporate at room temperature while exposed to nitrogen gas. The lipids were subsequently reconstituted in 50 \u00b5L of water-saturated 1-butanol and subjected to sonication for 10 min. The lipid extract was mixed with 50 \u00b5L of 10 mM ammonium formate in methanol. It was then spun at 10,000 x g for 10 min at room temperature. For lipid analysis, 80 \u00b5L of the supernatant was finally aliquoted into a glass insert with Teflon cap.</p>",

A Zorbax C18 column (1.8 \u03bcm, 50 x 2.1 mm; Agilent Technologies, Mississauga, ON) was used in positive ion mode in conjunction with a Prominence chromatographic system (Shimadzu Corporation, OR, USA). Instrument control and data processing were done with Analyst v1.6 and Multi-Quant v2.1 software (AB Sciex, MA, USA). The separation was achieved on a Zorbax C18, 1.8&nbsp;\u03bcm, 50 x 2.1&nbsp;mm column (Agilent Technologies, Mississauga, ON). The flow rate was set to 300&nbsp;\u03bcL/min using a linear gradient of mobile phase A and mobile phase B. Mobile phase A and B consisted of tetrahydrofuran, methanol and water in the ratio 20:20:60 (v/v/v) and 75:20:5 (v/v/v), respectively. Both A and B contained 10&nbsp;mM ammonium formate. Diacylglycerol (DG) and triacylglycerol (TG) species were separated in an isocratic fashion (100&nbsp;\u03bcL/min) by employing 85% mobile phase B over 8&nbsp;min.
