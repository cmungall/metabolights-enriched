                "description": "Untargeted approaches and thus biological interpretation of metabolomics results are still hampered by the reliable assignment of the global metabolome as well as classification and (putative) identification of metabolites. In this work we present an liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based stable isotope assisted approach that combines global metabolome and tracer based isotope labeling for improved characterization of (unknown) metabolites and their classification into tracer derived submetabolomes. To this end, wheat plants were cultivated in a customized growth chamber, which was kept at 400 \u00b1 50 ppm 13CO2 to produce highly enriched uniformly 13C-labeled sample material. Additionally, native plants were grown in the greenhouse and treated with either 13C9-labeled phenylalanine (Phe) or 13C11-labeled tryptophan (Trp) to study their metabolism and biochemical pathways. After sample preparation, liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) analysis and automated data evaluation, the results of the global metabolome- and tracer-labeling approaches were combined. A total of 1,729 plant metabolites were detected out of which 122 respective 58 metabolites account for the Phe- and Trp-derived submetabolomes. Besides m/z and retention time, also the total number of carbon atoms as well as those of the incorporated tracer moieties were obtained for the detected metabolite ions. With this information at hand characterization of unknown compounds was improved as the additional knowledge from the tracer approaches considerably reduced the number of plausible sum formulas and structures of the detected metabolites. Finally, the number of putative structure formulas was further reduced by isotope-assisted annotation tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) derived product ion spectra of the detected metabolites. A major innovation of this paper is the classification of the metabolites into submetabolomes which turned out to be valuable information for effective filtering of database hits based on characteristic structural subparts. This allows the generation of a final list of true plant metabolites, which can be characterized at different levels of specificity.",

                        "description": "<p><strong>Global Metabolome Labeling (GML)</strong></p><p><strong>Nutrient Solutions:</strong></p><p>In order to prepare uniformly (U-)13C-labeled wheat, plants were grown hydroponically using nutrient solutions adapted from previously described protocols[1][2]. Nutrient composition was adapted to the growing stages by the successive use of 2 different nutrient solutions (see Table S1 in the paper associated with this study). The start solution was used until plantlets reached growth stage 11 [BBCH scale[3]] followed by the nutrient solution for the vegetative period. Iron was supplied in form of a chelate complex. To prevent ambient CO2 being dissolved in the respective nutrient solution, its preparation was started by the addition of nitric acid to achieve a pH &lt;2.5. All other constituents (except KOH) were subsequently added while the solution was continuously homogenized with a magnetic stirrer. After autoclaving and immediately before the nutrient solution was put into the labelbox, its pH was adjusted with KOH to a value between 5.5 and 6.5.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Cultivation of Uniformly 13C Labeled Plants:</strong></p><p>13C labeling of wheat plants was performed in a customized growth chamber (phytolabelbox) (ECH Elektrochemie Halle GmbH, Halle, Germany) that allows for the control of N2/O2 (synthetic air) and 13CO2 content in the atmosphere. Ambient air (i.e. containing 12CO2) was prevented from entering the phytolabelbox by keeping the system at a slight overpressure of 10 mbar. Prior to positioning of seedlings into the phytolabelbox, seeds of the wheat cultivar Remus were put into blocks of rock wool (Grodan Delta Anzuchtw\u00fcrfel aus Steinwolle 4 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 4 cm; Grodan, Roermond, Netherlands) and watered with the start nutrient solution. Germination of seeds was carried out in closed shaded boxes to minimize light exposure. After vernalization at 4 \u00b0C for 24 h the seedlings were transferred to small containers together with perlite (Thermo-Floor, Natursand; Europerl, St. P\u00f6lten, Austria), which was covered with rock wool to prevent alga growth. The containers were transferred into the phytolabelbox and nutrient solution for the vegetative period was added. The atmospheric conditions inside the labelbox were recorded and regulated to CO2 400 \u00b1 50 ppm under light conditions; rel. humidity \u226470%; overpressure of 8 to 10 mbar; in order to save 13CO2, carbon dioxide was allowed to enrich up to 1,000 ppm in the dark. The parameters for the climate room in which the labelbox had been placed were chosen as follows: days 0\u201323: 12/12 h day/night cycle with temperatures of 16 \u00b0C and 12 \u00b0C respectively. 24 days after placing seedlings into the phytolabelbox, the day/night cycle was adjusted to 14/10 h and temperature was increased to 20 \u00b0C under illumination and 16 \u00b0C in the dark. Light was provided by different types of bulbs (Iwasaki NH360FLX, MT400DL BH; Iwasaki, Tokyo, Japan) and photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) values between 720 and 1,100 \u00b5mol/m^2/s were obtained. Nutrient solution for the vegetative period was added regularly using an external pump. At flowering stage, samples were harvested by cutting whole ears and immediate freezing them in liquid nitrogen. Samples were stored at \u221280\u00b0C until further analysis. For this cultivation 80 l 13CO2 were consumed to produce 330 g fresh plant material which corresponds to roughly 4 g fresh plant material/l 13CO2.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Cultivation of Native Plants:</strong></p><p>Native plants of cultivar Remus were cultivated in parallel to the 13C plants in a separate, identical phytolabelbox according to the protocol described above (see section Cultivation of Uniformly 13C Labeled Plants). However, 12CO2 was used instead of 13CO2.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Tracer Labeling (TL)</strong></p><p>Plants of the cultivar Remus were grown in the greenhouse until the flowering stage as previosly described[4]. At anthesis, 10 adjoining spikelets of a single ear were treated with a total of 200 \u00b5l of an aqueous 13C9-Phe (5 g/l in water) solution. For this, for every spikelet 10 \u00b5l of the tracer-solution were applied between the palea and lemma to each of the 2 primary florets without wounding the plant, corresponding to 1 mg of 13C9-Phe per ear in total. 3 separate ears were treated to obtain replicates. The treated ears were immediately covered with a wetted plastic bag for 24 h to maintain a high humidity. The treated parts of the wheat ear were harvested 72 h after inoculation, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until further analysis. In parallel the same procedure was carried out for 13C9-Trp (5 g/L in water) using different wheat ears of the same flowering stage.</p><p><br></p><p>Ref:</p><p>[1] Hoagland DR and Arnon DI. (1950).

The software searched for pairs of co-eluting native and U-13C-labeled wheat-metabolite ions, with the aim to detect all wheat metabolites. For the Phe-tracer and Trp-tracer treated samples, LC-HRMS chromatograms were processed with the software\u2019s TracExtract module. Here, the software searched for pairs of co-eluting native and partly 13C-labeled wheat-metabolite ions, which contained 1 or more (intact) 13C-labeled tracer-derived moieties or derivatives thereof using tracer specific parameter settings. For each of the 3 sample types, several solvent- as well as native wheat derived LC-HRMS data files were processed as native-blanks to estimate the number of false-positive results. A detailed list of all data processing parameter settings used for each experiment is provided in Table S2 of the paper associated with this study.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Combination of Global and Tracer-Based Labeling:</strong></p><p>Data processing by MetExtract II resulted in 3 separate lists of respective wheat metabolites (i.e. derived from GML, Phe-, and Trp-labeling respectively), which were subsequently merged into 1 data table by a custom software script implemented in the Python programming language (https://www.python.org). To this end, the m/z value of the monoisotopic, native isotopologs as well as their RT, ionization mode and charge number were compared across the 3 experiments. A maximum m/z deviation of \u00b15 ppm and a maximum RT shift of \u00b10.15 min was allowed for the respective features to be merged into a single metabolite/metabolic feature of the reference list. The determined number of 13C-atoms of each experiment was not considered during the merging step as this property is dependent on the labeling approach (i.e. uniformly or partly 13C-labeled ions respectively).</p><p><br></p><p>The output of this strategy is a comprehensive list of detected wheat-derived ions. Moreover, ions belonging to the same metabolite such as adducts, in-source fragments, or polymers are also automatically convoluted into metabolites. For each detected metabolite ion, its total number of carbon atoms, its number of carbon atoms derived from the Phe- or Trp-tracers, m/z, RT, charge number, ionization mode, and (if available) the assigned ion species (e.g. protonated or deprotonated ions) or common in-source fragment (e.g. -H2O), as well as an identifier to which metabolite (i.e. feature group) a certain ion belongs, are reported.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Target Search, Identification, Sum Formula Generation, and Annotation of Metabolites:</strong></p><p>After the results of all 3 approaches had been merged into a single data table, metabolites were identified based on comparison with authentic reference standards. Putative sum formulas were generated according to the Seven Golden Rules[3] and database searches were performed. A scheme giving an overview of these steps is depicted in Fig 2 of the paper associated with this study.</p><p><br></p><p>Ref:</p><p>[1] Kessner D, Chambers M, Burke R, Agusand D, and Mallick P.

                        "description": "<p>Metabolite identification was achieved by comparing RT, m/z, Cn from the GML experiment, and, if recorded, MS/MS fragment spectra of the detected compounds with authentic reference standards. This comparison allows level 1 identification, which is defined as successful comparison of at least two independent orthogonal parameters (e.g. MS, MS/MS, RT) of the metabolite of interest with an authentic reference standard measured under the same conditions (i.e. the same instrument and the same method)[1]. As a starting point for sum formula generation the Seven Golden Rules using C, H, N, O, S, and P were applied[2]. Only those putative sum formulas that had the same number of carbon atoms as determined in the GML approach were accepted. Subsequently, the detected metabolites were searched for in a wheat-specific in-house metabolite database collected from various sources (literature reports, PlantCyc [3], Combined Chemical Dictionary (http://ccd.chemnetbase.com/faces/chemical/ChemicalSearch.xhtml; last accessed November 2018) and Phenol Explorer[4] (currently consisting of &gt;1100 entries) and the public repositories ChEBI[5] and ChemSpider[6]. For this, the m/z values of the detected monoisotopic ions together with their assigned total number of carbon atoms were searched against the respective database entries. For both the sum formula generation and the database queries a maximum m/z deviation of \u00b15 ppm was allowed. The most commonly formed adducts ([M+H]+, [M+NH4]+, [M+Na]+, [M+K]+, [M+CH3OH+H]+, [M-H]\u2212, [M+Na-2H]\u2212, [M+Cl]\u2212, [M+Br]\u2212) were considered for calculating the putative mass of the metabolite from its respective ion whenever the mass of the non-charged intact metabolites could not be derived from the MS spectra (e.g. when only 1 ion species of the metabolite was detected). Any metabolite ion that was only detected in the Phe- or the Trp-tracer experiment and for which the total number of carbon atoms was thus unknown (no match in the GML approach), the determined number of tracer-derived carbon atoms was used as the minimum number of carbon atoms for generating sum formulas and querying the compounds against the databases. Sum formula generation and data base query resulted in the identification levels 2, 3, or 4[1].</p><p><br></p><p><strong>MS/MS Spectrum Evaluation:</strong></p><p>MS/MS fragment spectra were manually inspected using the XCalibur software (Thermo Scientific, version 4.0.27.19). If both the native and the 13C-labeled forms of an ion were fragmented (e.g. [M+H]+ native form, GML form and/or tracer-labeled form) automated MS/MS fragment spectra evaluation by the FragExtract module of MetExtract II was employed. Parameter settings are listed in Table S2bof the paper associated with this study. Additionally, a search in the mzCloud database (https://www.mzcloud.org) was conducted (similarity cutoff 85; HighChem HighRes matching algorithm).</p><p><br></p><p>Ref:</p><p>[1] Bla\u017eenovi\u0107 I, Kind T, Ji J, Fiehn O.
