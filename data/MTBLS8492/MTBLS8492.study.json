                "description": "<p>Blue mussels (Mytilus sp.) are an economically important species for European aquaculture. Their importance as a food source is expected to increase in the coming net-zero society due to their low environmental footprint; however, their production is affected by anthropogenic stressors and climate change. During reproduction, lipids are key molecules for mussels as they are the main source of energy on which newly hatched embryos depend in the first days of their development. In this work, blue mussels of different origins are analysed, focusing on the differences in lipid composition between the ovary (BMO) and the testis (BMT). The lipidome of blue mussel gonads (BMG) is studied here by combining traditional lipid profiling methods, such as fatty acid and lipid class analysis, with untargeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) lipidomics. The approach used here enabled the identification of 770 lipid molecules from 23 different lipid classes in BMG. BMT, which consists of billions of spermatocytes, had greater amounts of cell membrane and membrane lipid components such as FA18:0, C20 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), free sterols (ST), ceramide phosphoethanolamines (CerPE), ceramide aminoethylphosphonates (CAEP), cardiolipins (CL), glycerophosphocholines (PC), glycerophosphoethanolamines (PE) and glycerophosphoserines (PS). In BMO, saturated fatty acids (FA14:0 and FA16:0), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and other storage components such as C18-PUFA accumulated in triradylglycerolipids (TG) and alkyldiacylglycerols (neutral plasmalogens, TG O-), which, together with terpenes, wax esters and cholesterol esters, make up most of oocytes yolk reserves. BMO also had higher levels of ceramides (Cer) and generally alkyl/alkenyl glycerophospholipids (mainly plasmanyl/plasmenyl PC), suggesting a role for these lipids in vitellogenesis. Non-methylene interrupted dienoic fatty acids (NMID FA), typically found in plasmalogens, were the only membrane-forming PUFA predominantly detected in BMO. The results of this study are of great importance for clarifying the lipid composition of BMG and provide an important basis for future studies on the reproductive physiology of these organisms.</p>",

                        "description": "<p>The blue mussels (Mytilus sp) are an economically important species for European aquaculture, accounting, by weight, for over 50% of the bivalves produced across Europe. The present dataset involves the study of blue mussel gonad lipidome, including data on the testes and ovaries of this species. Manipulative experimental trials are employed to assess the effect of temperature profile on gonad lipidome during gamete maturation. LC-MS data are here combined with histological and biometric indexes aiming to correlate lipidome composition with the ultrastructural development of the gonad.</p><p><br></p><p>Mussel rearing conditions and sample preparation</p><p>Commercial size blue mussels (Mytilus sp., average shell size 5.6 \u00b1 0.6 cm) were obtained from local growers on the west coast of Scotland (Inverlussa Marine Services - www.inverlussa.com, Loch Spelve, Isle of Mull, UK) in February 2017. The mussels used in this work are referred to as blue mussels because Scotland is an area where the 3 Mytilus species found in Europe (Mytilus edulis, M. galloprovincialis and Mytilus trossolus) hybridise to form the Mytilus complex[1]. Recent studies have shown that the population in Loch Spelve is formed mainly (\u224885%) by M. edulis and M. edulis/M. galloprovincialis hybrids[2].</p><p><br></p><p>Upon arrival mussels were carefully cleaned, counted, sorted according to the size and placed for 48 h in a flow-through tank (sand-filtered seawater) at ambient temperature (7.5 \u00b0C) without feeding, to allow acclimation and depuration. Subsequently, mussels were randomly divided in into 15 lots, each containing 20 individuals. The diet (Instant Algae 1800, Reed Mariculture) was set as 3% of flesh dry weight per day[3], calculated from 3 sample lots (n=60). The total biomass per aquarium tank did not exceed 5 kg/120L[3]. In total 6 of the adult lots (n=120) were subjected to indoor conditioning through a 'cold and hold' method - C&amp;H, kept over whole experiment at 8 \u00b0C, whereas further 6 lots of adults (n=120) were subjected to an 'single stage conditioning' method - SSC, involving a temperature ramp from 8 to 16 \u00b0C[4]. At each sampling point another 60 adults were sourced from the local producers and processed in the same way of the indoor reared mussels as natural comparison - NC. Adults were sampled after 40 (n=60 per group) and 80 (n=60 per group) days of conditioning and processed for gonad histological analysis (GHA) and lipid analyses (Supplementary method 1 Figure 1). The inclusion of the different groups in the experimental design was decided to deconvolute the differences in the lipidome between the sexes from factors that inevitably influence lipid composition in organisms as the environment, the temperature or the diet.</p><p><br></p><p>Sample dissection</p><p>Gonads were dissected from 15 adults from each sample group (aside 10 for natural population at T80), as described previously[5]; briefly, mussels were opened 'book-like' by cutting with a sharp scalpel the hinge and the abductor's muscle. Gills were carefully removed by using a pair of bow scissors. The left valve mantle lobe was dissected and placed in 1.5 mL tube (Eppendorf), snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored -80 \u00b0C for lipid analysis.</p><p><br></p><p>Gonad histology</p><p>The right mantle lobe was excised and stored in 7 mL Bijoux tubes (VWR) in 4% buffered seawater formalin for GHA. The sex of each adult was determined by histological analysis of the gonads (GHA) after haematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining. Haematoxylin stains the nucleic acid structures dark blue, hence male follicles show a typical dark blue/black colour pattern. In contrast, oocytes have a considerable amount of cytoplasm and lipids and are stained with H&amp;E in different shades of pink. Formalin-fixed gonads were washed thoroughly with tap water and transversal sections of the tissue pieces were embedded in paraffin via automatic Citadel Tissue Processor (ThermoFisher). During this process, the sample pieces are automatically moved between different reagents through a dehydration (removal of water in the sample via several passages with different concentration alcohols), clearing (defatting and improving the miscibility with the embedding agent by treating the dehydrated tissues with chloroform and xylene) and wax embedding (cleared tissue is perfused with paraffin wax).</p><p><br></p><p>Embedded tissues pieces were blocked out in paraffin (Figure 2.7B) with a histoembedder (Histocore, Leica). At this point, the blocked tissue is ready for trimming and section cutting (Figure 2.7C). The cut was done with an HM24E Semi-automated rotary microtome (ThermoFisher Scientific), with a 20 \u03bcm cut thickness on trimming and 5 \u03bcm for sectioning. Trimming is a&nbsp;procedure that aims to remove paraffin excess, expose the tissue for sectioning and have a uniform cutting surface which enhance the quality of the section cuts. After trimming the blocks were soaked face-down on warm distilled water (30 \u00b0C), to rehydrate the tissue for 30 min, before being moved to a cold plate and kept face down (trimmed surface directly in contact with the cold plate) there for 5-10 min. This step aims to harden the paraffin block after the warm bath. Blocks were then turned up (trimmed surface away from the cold plate) and kept on the cold plate until sectioning. Blocks were clamped on the microtome for sectioning; when a ribbon of suitable sections was obtained, this was carefully collected with small brush and forceps and placed in the warm water bath, left a few seconds to expand. The expanded ribbon was collected directly on a pre-labelled microscope slide which was left to dry on a heated slide rack (35 \u00b0C). Racked slides were finally dried in an oven (60 \u00b0C) for at least 1 h before staining, to ensure a firm attachment of the tissue section to the slide surface (Figure 2.7D). Slides were stained with haematoxylin-eosin (HE). HE allows the visualization of different cell components by staining nuclei blue-black, cytosol structures and connective tissue with various shades of pink to red.</p><p><br></p><p>Gonad histology classification</p><p>HE stained slides were photographed with an inverted microscope Axioshop 2 (CarlZeiss) equipped with a camera AxioCam MRc5 (CarlZeiss) and acquired with the relative software AxioVision 4.7. GHA scores were attributed according to the gonad ultrastructure following a 4 staging classification system (Alfaro et al., 2001, Duinker et al., 2008, Seed &amp; Brown, 1977).</p><p><br></p><p>Resting (0): mantle dominated by storage tissue with little or absence of gonad tissue. Earliest stage cannot be sex determined. When possible females show oocytes in previtellogenic stage and males have only early stages of sperm cells (no spermatids or spermatozoa).</p><p>Early development (I): Acini are easily recognised and sex can be easily determined. Acini are small and scattered in the mantle. Oocytes started vitellogenesis and are often found in stalked shape (irregular shaped oocytes bulging from the follicle wall) presence of few mature oocytes still attached to the follicle wall. Male acini show immature spermatids constituting half or more of the acinus radius.&nbsp;</p><p>Late Development (II): The acini occupy a large portion of the mantle in both sexes. A large part of oocytes is in late vitellogenesis stage with evident yolk granules and vitelline envelope, but still attached to the acinus wall. Few mature oocytes are free in the lumen. Males have more mature spermatids than in the previous stage (although these still cover 1/4 of the acinus radius). Spermatozoa are evident in the lumen but not well organised.</p><p>Ripe (III): The mantle is completely covered by gonadal tissue, with small presence of storage tissue.&nbsp;Oocytes are mature and reached the maximum size. They are now free from acinus wall and are compressed in the lumen. In males, mature spermatozoa are abundant and well organised in layers in the follicle converging to the centre of the lumen. Just a thin layer of immature spermatocytes and spermatids is present.</p><p>Partial spawning (II-S): Acini still occupy a large portion of the mantle area. However, gametes density in the acini is lower due to partial spawning events. Females can still present a large number of ripe oocytes, but also show numerous empty spaces in the lumen. Presence of new oocytes on the acinus wall indicated redeveloping of the gonads. In males, acini show ruptures and empty spaces with ripe spermatozoa less organized in the lumen.&nbsp;</p><p>Full spawning (I-S): Acini almost empty collapse and degenerate, large portion of the mantle are occupied by storage tissue. Haemocytes degrade unspawned gametes.</p><p><br></p><p>The presence of pre-spawning atresia was also monitored in gonad histological preparations. Evidences of gonad atresia in females were detected following what reported by Beninger (2017). Atretic oocytes were irregularly shaped and shrunken, fading in a macrophage matrix with vacuolated cytoplasm and ruptures in the cell membranes (Figure 2.9A). Signs of gonad atresia in males included the reduction of follicle volume and proliferation of haemocytes with phagocytic activity in the mantle connective tissue, Figure 2.9B (Suarez et al., 2005).</p><p><br></p><p>Gamete volume fraction</p><p>A stereological variable quantifying the percentage of mantle area covered by gametes (gamete volume fraction - GVF) was calculated for all gonad preparations via image analysis. Larger view field images of the tissues (5x magnification) were captured with a Stemi 2000-C stereomicroscope (CarlZeiss) equipped with a camera AxioCam MRc5 and acquired with the relative software AxioVision 4.7. For each mussel, images from the 3 different pieces of gonads were analysed and the resulting values were averaged, providing the GVF parameter. Each slide was analysed by ImageJ software (www.imagej.nih.gov) via the colour threshold method. Briefly, all areas not covered by gonads were cropped out from each GHA image (Figure 2.10A-B). The entire gonad tissue provided the total gonad area (expressed in pixels). The image colours were inverted and image contrast modified, to enhance colour differences between connective tissue (dark-green) and the follicles (yellow). Yellow coloured areas (gametes) were over-exposed via the colour-threshold function , selected and the gamete area quantified (expressed in pixels). GVF was calculated as the percentage between total mantle surface and gamete covered mantle surface.</p><p><br></p><p>Refs:</p><p>[1] (Kijewski et al., 2011)</p><p>[2] (Wilson, 2016)</p><p>[3] (Helm and Bourne, 2004)</p><p>[4] (Kamermans et al., 2013)</p><p>[5] Mart\u00ednez-Pita et al.

Gonads (\u224850 mg dry powder) were individually homogenised (1:8 weight:volume) on a glass potter in HPLC water (Fisherbrand) for 1 min on ice. Biological quality control (BQC) samples were prepared by mixing 20 \u00b5L of gonad homogenate from all samples. Aliquots (50 \u00b5L) of BQC were extracted in parallel with the samples.</p><p><br></p><p>Lipid extraction was done according literature[1]. Briefly 6 mL of 2:1 Chloroform:Methanol (FisherBrand) mixture were added to the homogenate, which was vigorously shaken and left to extract for 1 h on ice. To avoid oxidation during the extraction, the vials were flushed with a gentle stream of nitrogen and kept away from direct light during all the extraction procedure. The mixture was centrifuged (350 x g, min, 4 \u00b0C) and the supernatant recovered on a clean tube. The extraction was repeated on the pellet with a further 3 mL of Folch extraction mixture. Following a second centrifugation step the 2 organic supernatants were mixed together and a 0.9% KCl solution (VWR) was added to obtain a final ratio of 2:1:0.8 chloroform:methanol:0.9% KCl, depending on the water volume added with the homogenate. The aqueous and organic phases were separated by a second centrifugation step (350 x g, 5 min, 4 \u00b0C). The organic layer was recovered and evaporated under a gentle nitrogen stream (NVap, Organomation). The dried lipid extracts were weighted and resuspended in 0.5 mL of chloroform constituting the total lipid extract (TLE). The TLE was divided into 2 sub-aliquots. First aliquot (400 \u00b5L) was dried down in nitrogen and stored at -80 \u00b0C for lipid class and lipidomics analysis. Second aliquot (100 \u00b5L) was added an internal standard (FA17:0, Sigma + 0.001% of BHT, Cayman Chemical Company at the 10% of the total lipid mass) and processed for fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) analysis.</p><p><br></p><p>Ref:</p><p>[1] Folch et al.

Water and acetonitrile were HPLC grade and obtained from Fisher, IPA was LC-MS grade (Hypergrade LiChrosolv, Merck), while ammonium formate and formic acid were both LC-MS grade and obtained from Sigma Aldrich. TLE were suspended in 3:1 methanol:chloroform at a concentration of 1 mg/mL with 3 \u03bcL injection volume.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Table1: Binary gradient used during LC-MS analysis of TLE.

A technical QC sample was run every 6 h of instrument operation time to monitor possible technical shift in the machine. This process involves chromatogram alignment, data filtering, feature detection and deconvolution, and normalization. Chromatograms were automatically aligned using a QC as a reference point. During the filtering, the ion intensity of the analytes is separated from background noise. In feature detection, the signal caused by real features is detected, thereby reducing the likelihood to detect false positives. When the features of interest are detected, data is subjected to deconvolution. The aim of deconvolution is to assign all the different ions produced from a metabolite (as isotope features, adducts, neutral loss) to that same compound. Peak picking and deconvolution were completed following automatic settings of the software.</p><p><br></p><p>Data were normalised according to automatic settings in Progenesis QI. Data normalization minimizes bias due to systematic experimental or technical errors. For example, compounds not changing in the experiment should have a quantitative abundance ratio between treatments close to 1, due to experimental and technical systematic errors the actual ratio will possibly be different than 1. Progenesis QI calculates the median and mean absolute deviation for all detected features, and then employs these parameters to calculate common scalar factors that are used to normalise the data. In this process, the most suitable normalization reference chromatogram from the sample set is selected, and then for each detected ion, a quantitative abundance ratio between the run being normalised and the reference run is calculated. Contaminants were manually removed from the peak intensity table (PIT) generated from this process.</p>",
