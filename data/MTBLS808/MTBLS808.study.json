                "description": "Truffles are among the most expensive foods available in the market, usually used as flavoring additives for their distinctive aroma. The most valuable species is Tuber magnatum Pico, better known as 'Alba white truffle', in which bis(methylthio)methane is the key aroma compound. Given the high economical value of genuine white truffles, analytical approaches are required to be able to discriminate between natural or synthetic truffle aroma. With the proteomic approach based on 2-DE followed by mass spectrometry, we were able to identify proteins specifically linked to sample origin. We further associated the proteomic results to an RNA-seq profiling, which confirmed the possibility to differentiate samples according to their source and provided a basis for the detailed analysis of genes involved in a specific metabolism, that of sulfur compounds. Finally, geographical specificities could be associated to the set of volatile compounds produced by the fruiting bodies, as quantitatively and qualitatively determined through PTR-MS and GC-MS. In particular, a PLS-DA model built from the latter data was able to return high confidence predictions of sample source.",

This was equipped with a 1 cm long fused silica fiber coated with a 50/30 \u03bcm layer of divinylbenzene/carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane (MilliporeSigma/Supelco, Bellefonte, PA, USA) to extract the volatile components from the truffles. The fibre was conditioned following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions previous to its use (270 \u00b0C for 0.5 h). Samples were conditioned for 5 min at 50 \u00b0C, under agitation (clockwise rotation at 500 rpm), and then underwent the extraction step for 15 min at 50 \u00b0C, still under agitation as previously indicated. Analytes were then desorbed into the GC injection port for 1 min at 260 \u00b0C in splitless mode. Blanks were run between consecutive analyses. Each sample was analyzed in triplicate.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>PTR-MS:</strong></p><p>For each sample, about 10 grams of material were placed in a glass jar and covered with a special lid that allowed Teflon connection to a zero-air generator (inlet) and to the PTR-TOF-MS system (outlet).

Briefly, the homogenates were centrifuged for 15 min at 13.000 rcf at 4 \u00b0C in order to eliminate debris. Supernatants, containing extracted proteins, were precipitated using 13% TCA and 0.007% beta-mercaptoethanol in acetone, transferred to -20 \u00b0C for 2 hr and finally kept at 4 \u00b0C for 2 hr.</p><p><br></p><p>Samples were then centrifuged at 14000 rcf at 4 \u00b0C for 15 min and the pellet was washed twice with cold acetone (100%), re-centrifuged at the same speed, mixed with 50-500 \u03bcl extraction buffer and centrifuged at 3000 rcf at 4 \u00b0C for 25 min. Protein quantification was done by Bradford assay (BIO-RAD Hercules, CA) using Bovine serum albumin (BSA) as standard.</p><p><br></p><p>Spectrophotometric measurements were carried out using a Cintral 101 spectrophotometer (GBC Scientific Equipment) at 595 nm in double beam mode. 12 or 16 replicate gels (4 for each year of collection) were performed for each biological sample, depending on the overall duration of the study for each of the sampling locations evaluated. Samples (1 mg) of protein were directly loaded by in-gel rehydration onto an IPG (Immobilized pH Gradient) gel strip for preparative analysis. IPG strips (18 cm, GE-Healthcare), with pH range 4-7, were rehydrated with 350 l of IEF sample buffer (8 M urea, 2% w/v CHAPS, 40 mM DTT and 0.5% v/v IPG Buffer) containing the samples. High resolution (300 dpi) images of 2-DE gels were prepared using the Densitometer GS-800 (BioRad). Computer-assisted 2D image analysis was done using the Progenesis SameSpots vs 3.2.3 gel analysis software (NonLinear Dynamics) for 3 technical replicates for each biological condition (different years) from 3 independent extraction experiment procedures.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Yang Q, Wang Y, Zhang J, Shi W, Qian C, Peng X.

The reaction takes place between H3O+ ions and all the biogenic VOCs having a proton affinity higher than that of water (165.2 kcal/mol). The separation of the resulting single ions depends on their mass to charge (m/z) ratio. The reaction takes place in a reaction chamber (Drift tube) under controlled conditions of applied voltage (set at 600 V), temperature (at 110 \u00b0C) and pressure (at 2.25 mbar). Compounds such as 1,4-dichlorobenzene (m/z = 146.976) and 1,2,3-trichlorobenzene (m/z = 180.937) were continuously used, together with other known low mass ions, for a precise conversion of 'time-of-flight' into 'mass-to-charge' ratio (m/z) in order to assign the exact mass scale and the sum formula of all ions during VOC analysis[1][2]. The head space was then measured by direct injection into the PTR-TOF-MS drift tube inlet for 150 s, after 10 min of exposure. Preliminary measurements on an empty jars were run before every experiment and used for background subtraction. All mass spectra up to m/z = 250 were simultaneously detected and recorded with 1 s as the integration time. Internal calibration was based on m/z = 21.0202 (H318O+), m/z = 29.9974 (NO+) and m/z = 59.0491 (C3H6O+)<strong>[1][2]</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>LC-MS/MS(Protein):</strong></p><p>Spectra were acquired on a Thermo Finnigan LTQ XL mass spectrometer, equipped with Proxeon nanospray source, in the range m/z 400-2000.

Briefly, raw spectra data (count rate of the analytes recorded were expressed in number of counts per second, cps) were acquired with TOFDaq software (TOFwerk AG, Switzerland) using a dead time of 20 ns for the Poisson correction and peak extraction followed the methodology previously described[1], employing a modified Gaussian peak shape. For peak quantification the resulting data were corrected according to the duty cycle and the signals were normalized to the primary ion signal (cps to ncps) as previously described[2]. For each sample, the average data resulting from 20 consecutive seconds of measurement were extracted 3 min after the beginning of the experiment. All spectra were corrected for count losses due to the detector dead time, applying Poisson correction in the DAQ settings of TOFDAQ configuration options. External calibration was automatically done by the acquisition program and it achieved a mass accuracy of 0.001 Th for the considered mass range, which was in most cases sufficient for formula identification.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>LC-MS/MS(Protein):</strong></p><p>MASCOT software package (Matrix Science, UK) was used to identify protein spots unambiguously from an updated tuber non-redundant sequence database from NCBI by using a mass tolerance value of 2.2 Da for precursor ion and 0.8 Da for MS/MS fragments, trypsin as proteolytic enzyme, a missed cleavages maximum value of 2 and Cys carbamidomethylation and Met oxidation as fixed and variable modification, respectively. Candidates with more than 2 assigned peptides with MASCOT score &gt; 25 (p &lt; 0.01 for a significant identification) were further evaluated by the comparison of their calculated mass value with that obtained from SDS-PAGE. Where appropriate, protein identification was checked manually to provide for a false positive rate of less than 1%. Identified proteins were then sorted basing on their exponentially modified protein abundance index (emPAI) for each candidate spots; this index allows to estimate relative quantification based on protein coverage.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Cappellin, L. et al.
