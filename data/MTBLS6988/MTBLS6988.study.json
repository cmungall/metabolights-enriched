                "description": "<p>Chicken farming is critical for future food security, yet there is still a need for improving animal welfare and optimised feeding strategies. HoloFood will explore the interaction and impact of the microbiome together with the host (animal) in response to different feeding strategies already implemented commercially. Chicken farming has recently made huge efforts towards healthy, natural food production without using chemicals or antibiotics in food systems. As such natural alternatives, such as prebiotic and probiotic additives to chicken feed, have been a huge improvement. Nonetheless, the full impact of these natural alternatives and the variation in chicken growth is still poorly understood. HoloFood aims to investigate the effect and interplay between the host (chicken) - microbiome in response to different dietary additives.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>HoloFood Trial 1/2/3</strong>&nbsp;is reported in the current study&nbsp;<a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS6988' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS6988</strong></a>.</p><p><strong>HoloFood Trial A - seaweed-dose response</strong>&nbsp;is reported in <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS4381' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS4381</strong></a>.</p><p><strong>HoloFood Trial B - blue mussel-dose response</strong>&nbsp;is reported in&nbsp;<a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS4382' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS4382</strong></a>.</p><p><strong>HoloFood Trial C - blue mussel ensilage-dose response</strong>&nbsp;is reported in&nbsp;<a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS4384' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS4384</strong></a>.</p><p><strong>HoloFood Trial D - fermented seaweed open water-dose</strong> response&nbsp;is reported in&nbsp;<a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS6733' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS6733</strong></a>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Linked cross omic data sets:</strong></p><p>Nucleic acid data associated with this study are available in the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA): accession number <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJEB43192' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>PRJEB43192</a>.</p><p>Metagenomic data associated with this study are available from MGnify under the Super Study '<a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/super-studies/holofood' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>holofood</a>'.</p>",

                        "description": "<p>The poultry experiments in HoloFood aimed at understanding how animal-microbiota interactions were modulated by feed additives, and how these interactions affected production indicators. The study consisted of 3 identical experiments (A, B, and C). The 3 trials were carried out in different seasons of the year: spring (trial A), summer (trial B) and autumn (trial C). An overview of the experimental conditions and set-up is shown in the following, while detailed information can be found in literature<strong>[1]</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Experimental conditions</strong></p><p>In each experiment, 24 pens were used to house a total of 960 day-old broiler chicks from 2 fast-growing genetic lines (Ross308 and Cobb500) obtained from two hatcheries to increase genetic diversity. To eliminate the potential effect of parent stock, the chicks were distributed in a way that ensured each replicate had an equal number of birds from each hatchery tray. Each pen, which measured 2.25 m^2, accommodated 40 birds and was equipped with an individual hopper feeder and 2 nipple drinkers. The barn was without windows but had automatic environmental control, including a gas heating system, screens for ventilation, and programmable lighting with TL tubes. The temperature was adjusted based on the standard farm program, with an increase from 32 to 34 \u00b0C for the first 2 days and a gradual decrease by 3 \u00b0C per week until it reached 21 \u00b0C. The lighting program consisted of 24 h of light for the first 2 days, followed by 18 h of light until day 7, and 14 h of light thereafter. The litter used was fresh wood shavings. All chicks were vaccinated against Avian Infectious Bronchitis and Gumboro diseases according to the hatchery\u2019s standard vaccination program.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Experimental design</strong></p><p>The study utilized a randomized complete block design, with a 2 x 2 x 3 factorial arrangement based on broiler line (Ross308 or Cobb500), sex (male or female) and dietary treatment: 1) basal diet (BD), 2) BD supplemented with a probiotic additive (PR), and 3) BD supplemented with a phytobiotic additive (PH). Each treatment was randomly assigned to one pen in each block (2 blocks per experiment), resulting in 2 replicates (pens) per treatment in each experiment (for a total of 6), with 40 animals per pen (20 from each hatchery). The experimental design differed from conventional studies that test the effect of feed additives on performance, as it was designed to increase inter-individual genetic variability, thus improving the likelihood of identifying interactions between animal and microbial genomic features. To avoid observer bias in subsequent samplings, 6 animals per pen were randomly selected and marked on day 0 to be slaughtered at days 7, 21 and 35.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Diets, additives and feeding</strong></p><p>To maximise the impact of feed additives, the basal diet (BD) was designed to be pro-inflammatory, utilising wheat (a cereal high in non-starch polysaccharides (NSP) with over 50% inclusion) and soybean meal as main ingredients, without the addition of enzymes, antibiotics or coccidiostats. The diets were formulated according to bird requirements and commercial practices, and divided into 3 periods: starter (0-9 days), grower (10-23 days) and finisher (24-37 days). Feeds were presented as crumbles for the starter period and 3 mm pellets for later periods. The probiotic (PR) treatment included BD with a mixture of 3 strains, specifically Bacillus subtilis DSM 32324, B. subtilis DSM 32325 and B. amyloliquefaciens DSM 25840 (inclusion level of 0.75 g/kg feed, &gt;3.20 x 109 CFU/g). The phytobiotic (PH) treatment used BD supplemented with a phytobiotic additive obtained from white grapes, containing 78% procyanidins and 22% polyphenols as active ingredients (inclusion level of 0.75 g/kg feed).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Animal sampling</strong></p><p>A total of 6 animals per pen were selected randomly and individually weighed, evaluated for footpad dermatitis, and euthanized for sampling at days 7-8, 21-22 and 35-37 (multiple days were required due to workload). Euthanasia was performed in accordance with the ethical requirements established by RD 53/2013 (Spain). A total of 14 samples were collected from each animal after euthanasia to measure individual key performance indicators and generate multi-omic and complementary analyses. The measured KPIs were aimed at quantifying the quantity, quality and safety of the produced food, the sustainability of the production process, and the welfare of the produced animals. Samples were obtained from sections of ileum and cecum, intestinal content from ileum and cecum, feathers and blood. Different aliquots were distributed and stored appropriately for downstream analyses.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Metabolomics</strong></p><p>Non-targeted metabolomic data was generated from the ileal and caecal digesta of 35-day-old broiler chickens. Samples were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and preserved at -80 \u00b0C until metabolite extraction.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Tous N, Marcos S, Goodarzi Boroojeni F, P\u00e9rez de Rozas A, Zentek J, Estonba A, Sandvang D, Gilbert MTP, Esteve-Garcia E, Finn R, Alberdi A, Tarradas J.
