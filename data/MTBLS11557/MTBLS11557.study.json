                "description": "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a hematologic malignancy with a poor prognosis. We discovered that BMAL1 is a ferroptosis suppressor. Furthermore, it was also found to be overexpressed in AML patients, affecting the cell cycle and promoting tumor cell growth and progression. In this study, we further validated the association of BMAL1 with the progression and survival outcomes of AML. Lipidomic revealed that the levels of ceramide increased in AML cells following the depletion of BMAL1. Ceramide facilitated ferroptosis in AML cells. ASAH2 played a key role in this process. BMAL1 could not directly regulate ASAH2 but instead through IKZF2. Elevated levels of ceramide promoted the degradation of the ferroptosis protection molecule GPX4, ultimately promoting ferroptosis. Furthermore, ceramide treatment has been demonstrated to enhance the responsiveness of AML cells to sorafenib. In summary, this study elucidates that BMAL1 depletion remodels ceramide metabolism to regulate the sensitivity of AML cells to ferroptosis and targeted drug sorafenib.",

Subsequently, we plated both control and BMAL1-knockdown HL60 cells in optimal growth condition onto 10-cm dishes at a density of 1 x 10^7 cells per dish. To guarantee a sufficient cell count for sequencing (&gt;1 x 10^7 cells per sample), we grouped two dishes of cells as one set. These cells were then treated with RSL3 (0.5 \u03bcM) for a duration of 24 h. Following the completion of drug treatment, the cells from the two dishes within each set were collected into a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube at 2000 rpm for 3 min. The cells were then washed 3 times with 1 mL of DPBS per tube. After thoroughly removing the DPBS, the cells were promptly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 \u00b0C. The samples were prepared for sequencing 1 day after being stored</p>",
