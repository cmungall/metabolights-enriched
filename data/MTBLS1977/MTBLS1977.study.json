                "description": "<p>The composition and physical properties of the extracellular matrix (ECM) critically influence tumor progression, but the molecular mechanisms underlying ECM layering are poorly understood. Tumor-stroma interaction is critically dependent on cell-cell communication mediated by exosomes, small vesicles generated within multivesicular bodies (MVBs). Here, we show that caveolin-1 (Cav1) is a central modulator of both exosome biogenesis and exosomal protein cargo sorting through the regulation of cholesterol content at the endosomal compartment/MVBs. Quantitative proteomics profiling revealed that Cav1 is required for exosomal sorting of ECM protein cargo subsets including tenascin-C (TnC), and for fibroblast-derived exosomes to efficiently depose ECM and promote tumor cell invasiveness. Cav1-driven exosomal ECM deposition not only promotes local stromal remodeling, but also the generation of distant ECM-enriched stromal niches. These results support a model by which Cav1 is a central regulatory hub for tumor-stroma interactions through a novel exosome-dependent ECM deposition mechanism.</p><p><br></p><p>Linked studies: <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS1969' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>MTBLS1969</a></p>",

Samples (exosomes) were isolated from cultured fibroblasts grown in exosome-free culture medium. To remove detached cells, conditioned medium was collected and centrifuged at 300 g for 10 min at 4\u00baC. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 2000 g for 20 min at 4\u00baC. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 10000 g at 4\u00baC for 30 min to completely remove contaminating apoptotic bodies, microvesicles and cell debris. The clarified medium was then ultracentrifuged at 110,000 g at 4\u00baC for 70 min to pellet exosomes. The supernatant was carefully removed, and crude exosome-containing pellets were washed in ice-cold PBS. After a second round of ultracentrifugation, the resulting exosome pellets were resuspended in the desired volume of PBS. Samples were stored at -80\u00baC before further processing.</p>",

The peak area of Cholesterol and the internal standard Cholesterol (d7) of each replicates was qualified using the algorithm \u201cgenesis\u201d in Freestyle software (Version 1.3.115.19 Thermo). The identification of Cholesterol was performed comparing the fragmentation spectra obtained during the analysis with the one listed in Metlin database, and comparing the experimental RT with the one of the internal standard Cholesterol (d7).</p><p>Cholesterol was quantified according to the response factor (RF) of the respective internal standard Cholesterol (d7). RF = internal standard concentration \u00d7 peak area analyte/peak area internal standard.</p>",
