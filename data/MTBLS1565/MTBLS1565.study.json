                "description": "<p><strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong> The production of high quality and safe food represents a main priority for the agri-food sector in the effort to sustain the exponentially growing human population. Nonetheless, there are major challenges that require the discovery of new, alternative, and improved plant protection products (PPPs). Focusing on fungal plant pathogens, the dissection of mechanisms that are essential for their survival provides insights that could be exploited towards the achievement of the aforementioned aim. In this context, the germination of fungal spores, which are essential structures for their dispersal, survival, and pathogenesis, represents a target of high potential for PPPs. To the best of our knowledge, no PPPs that target the germination of fungal spores currently exist.</p><p><strong>OBJECTIVES:</strong> Within this context, we have mined for changes in the metabolite profiles of the model fungus Aspergillus nidulans FGSC&nbsp;A4 conidiospores during germination, in an effort to discover key metabolites and reactions that could potentially become targets of PPPs.</p><p><strong>METHODS:</strong> Untargeted GC/EI-TOF/MS metabolomics and multivariate analyses were employed to monitor time-resolved changes in the metabolomes of germinating A. nidulans conidiospores.</p><p><strong>RESULTS:</strong> Analyses revealed that trehalose hydrolysis plays a pivotal role in conidiospore germination and highlighted the osmoregulating role of the sugar alcohols, glycerol, and mannitol.</p><p><strong>CONCLUSION:</strong> The ineffectiveness to introduce active ingredients that exhibit new mode(s)-of-action as fungicides, dictates the urge for the discovery of PPPs, which could be exploited to combat major plant protection issues. Based on the crucial role of trehalose hydrolysis in conidiospore dormancy breakage, and the subsequent involvement of glycerol in their germination, it is plausible to suggest their biosynthesis pathways as potential novel targets for the next-generation antifungal PPPs. Our study confirmed the applicability of untargeted metabolomics as a hypothesis-generation tool in PPPs' research and discovery.</p>",

Fungal cultures were incubated for 5 days at 37 \u00b0C, in Petri plates containing CM, supplemented with N-sources at the recommended concentrations by the <a href='http://www.fgsc.net/' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>Fungal Genetics Stock Center</a>. Sampling of conidiospores was performed by scrapping off the surface of the cultures using a sterilized metallic spatula. The collected material was removed from the spatula by immersion in 0.01% v/v tween 80 solution (10 ml) in 50 ml falcon tubes and pooled. For the separation of conidiospores from the vegetative structures, the collected material was immersed in 0.01% v/v tween 80 solution, vortexed (1 min), and filtered through appropriate nylon mesh (pore size \u2265 50\u03bcm). The spore density of the obtained filtrates was measured in an optical microscope using a haematocytometer (Brand GMBH + CO KG, Wertheim, Germany). The resulting filtrate was re-suspended in liquid C\u039c, in order to adjust the density to 10^8 conidiospores/ml. The conidiospore suspensions were sampled at 1 h intervals, until 6 h of incubation in an orbital incubator (e.g. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 h) (at 37\u00b11 \u00b0C, 150 rpm, dark). The last sampling was performed at 24 h, when most of the conidiospores had germinated. In total, 6 biological replications were performed per time-point.</p>",

Then, 1 ml of cold MeOH (-40 \u00b0C) was immediately added in the obtained pellets for the simultaneous clean up and quenching, followed by a second centrifugation (8000 rpm, -3 \u00b0C, 5 min). The supernatants were discarded, and the procedure was repeated once. The extraction of the conidiospores' endometabolome was performed by adding 500 \u03bcl of methanol-ethyl acetate (50:50, v/v) in the cell pellets, followed by vortexing<strong>[1]</strong>. The resulting suspensions were immediately placed in liquid N2 for 5 min, followed by incubation for 5 min on ice. The liquid N2-to ice freeze-to-thaw cycle, was repeated twice (3 times in total) for the lysis of cells and an optimal recovery of the endometabolome<strong>[2][3]</strong>. Following cell lysis, suspensions were spiked with 20 \u03bcl of a ribitol solution (0.2 mg/ml in methanol), sonicated for 20 min in an ultrasonic bath (Branson 1210, Connecticut, NE, USA), and finally, agitated (200 rpm) for 2 h at 24 \u00b0C&nbsp;on a GFL 3006 shaker (Burgwedel, Germany). Suspensions were then filtered using 0.2 \u03bcm PTFE filters (Macherey\u2013Nagel, Duren, Germany) and transferred in 1.5 ml safe-lock micro vials.

Then, 80 \u03bcl of N,O-Bis(trimethylsilyl)tri uoroacetamide (BSTFA) containing a retention index (RI) standard solution in a 7:1 (v/v) ratio was added, followed by mixing using a vortex, and incubated for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C. A mixture of n-alkanes (C10, C12, C15, C18, C19, C22, C28, C30, C36) (Sigma-Aldrich Ltd; cat. no. CAS 110-86-1) at a final concentration of 0.22 mg/ml each was used as the RI standard solution. The derivatized samples were finally transferred to micro-inserts in 2 ml GC autosampler vials for gas chromatography/electron impact time-of-flight/mass spectrometry GC/EI-TOF/MS analyses. In order to assess the quality of analysis, chemically defined multi-component mixtures and lab-internal biological reference samples for quality control (QC) were used. Additional information on the retention time index calculations can be found in previous publication<strong>[1]</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p>An Agilent 6890N gas chromatograph (Agilent, Boblingen, Germany) equipped with a Pegasus III TOF mass</p><p>spectrometer (LECO Instrumente GmbH, Monchengladbach, Germany) and CTC Combi PAL autosampler with PAL cycle composer software v1.5.0 (CTC Analytics AG, Zwingen, Switzerland) was employed. Previously described analytical conditions were applied with minor modifications<strong>[3]-[5]</strong>. Briefly, samples were analyzed in both split (1:30) and splitless modes with an injector temperature of 250 \u00b0C. The samples (1 \u03bcl) were injected onto a low-bleed capillary column (VF-5ms, length; 30 m, i.d.; 0.25 mm, film thickness 0.25 \u03bcm Varian Inc., Lake Forest, CA) using an integrated 10 m pre-column. Helium was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min. The initial temperature of the oven was set at 70 \u00b0C stable for 1 min, followed by a 9 \u00b0C/min increase to 350 \u00b0C, and then kept constant for 5 min.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Strehmel N, Hummel J, Erban A, Strassburg K, Kopka J.

Guidelines for manually supervised metabolite identification were the presence of at least 3 specific mass fragments per compound and a retention index deviation &lt; 1.0%<strong>[7]</strong>. Selected analytical reference standards of fungal metabolites (Sigma-Aldrich Ltd), were co-analyzed to verify tentative compound identifications by mass spectral and retention index matching (see <strong>Supplementary Dataset S1</strong> in the paper associated with this study). The MS1 level of metabolite feature annotation was based on the guidelines of the metabolomics standards initiative (MSI)<strong>[8]</strong>. Blank samples that had been prepared following identical experimental protocol served to monitor possible chemical contaminations (e.g. by sample handling and preparation, reagents, column bleeding, the instrument). For the biological interpretation of the results, a previously described approach was adopted<strong>[6]</strong>. The construction of metabolic network was based on information retrieved from the KEGG database, using the software Vanted v. 2.6.5<strong>[9][10]</strong>. The majority of the metabolites were quantified in splitless injection mode.
