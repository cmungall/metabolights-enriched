                "description": "<p>In this study, lipid alterations in Beagle dog\u2019s liver caused by <em>Toxocara canis</em> infection were investigated by using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry at 12 hours post infection (hpi), 24 hpi and 36 days post infection (dpi). A total of 6 categories and 42 subclasses of lipids were identified, including 173, 64 and 116 differentially abundant lipid species at 12 hpi, 24 hpi and 36 dpi, respectively. Many of the identified lysophospholipids, such as lysophosphatidylglycerol, lysophosphatidyiserine and lysophosphatidylcholine, seem to contribute to the migration and development of <em>T. canis</em> at the early infection stage. Pathway analysis revealed significant alterations of several lipid metabolism pathways, such as B cell receptor signaling pathway, NF-kappa B signaling pathway and C-type lectin receptor signaling pathway at 12 hpi and 24 hpi. Our findings provide the first detailed insight into how <em>T. canis</em> infection causes substantial changes in the composition and abundance of hepatic lipid metabolites with relevance to pathophysiology of toxocariasis in Beagle dogs.</p>",

Multivariate and univariate analyses were conducted by using <strong>metaX R</strong> package, including the deletion of lipid species that missing more than 50% of QC samples and more than 80% of experimental samples, normalization of LC-MS/MS data and deletion of the lipid species whose CV (coefficient of variation) of relative peak area was &gt; 30% in all QC samples<strong>[1]</strong>. The quality of LC-MS/MS data was examined using QC samples, including chromatograms overlap of QC samples, PCA (principal component analysis) analysis, peak number, and peak response intensity difference. The PCA and PLS-DA (partial least squares method-discriminant analysis) were used to perform the multivariate statistical analysis. Furthermore, the quantitative analysis of lipid subclasses was performed to reveal the relative amounts of lipid subclasses in each infected and control groups at the lipid subclasses level. In this study, lipids that met the following conditions were considered as differentially abundant lipids: VIP \u2265 1, Fold change \u22651.2 or \u2264 0.8333 and p value &lt; 0.05. Hierarchical clustering analysis was conducted for differential lipids and the Euclidian distance was used for distance calculation and Z-score (zero-mean normalization) for data normalization. Metabolic pathway analysis based on the <strong>Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes </strong>(<strong>KEGG</strong>; <a href='http://www.genome.jp/kegg' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>http://www.genome.jp/kegg</a>) database was performed to explore the possible inter-relatedness among the detected lipid metabolites induced by T. canis infection. The conversion of name between the lipid compounds acquired by LC-MS/MS and the KEGG ID in the KEGG database was conducted by<strong> MetaboAnalyst v.5.0</strong> prior to the<strong> KEGG enrichment analysis[2]</strong>(<a href='https://www.metaboanalyst.ca/MetaboAnalyst/upload/ConvertView.xhtml' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>https://www.metaboanalyst.ca/MetaboAnalyst/upload/ConvertView.xhtml</a>). Because multiple lipids with a specific function may correspond to the same KEGG ID, the conversion results were manually selected to march the correct KEGG ID and to determine the effect of altered lipids on the metabolic pathways.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Wen B, Mei Z, Zeng C, Liu S. metaX: a flexible and comprehensive software for processing metabolomics data.
