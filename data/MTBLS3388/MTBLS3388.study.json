                "description": "<p>The effects of iron deficiency (ID) during infancy extend beyond the hematologic compartment and include short- and long-term adverse effects on many tissues including the brain. However, sensitive biomarkers of iron-dependent brain health are lacking in humans. To determine whether serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of ID-induced metabolic dysfunction are concordant in the pre/early anemic stage of ID before anemia in a nonhuman primate model of infantile iron deficiency anemia (IDA). ID (n = 7), rhesus infants at 4 mo (pre-anemic period) and 6 mo of age (anemic) were examined. Hematological, metabolomic and proteomic profiles were generated via HPLC/MS at both time points to discriminate serum biomarkers of ID-induced brain metabolic dysfunction. We identified 227 metabolites and 205 proteins in serum. Abnormalities indicating altered liver function, lipid dysregulation and increased acute phase reactants were present in ID. In CSF, we measured 210 metabolites and 1560 proteins with changes in ID infants indicative of metabolomic and proteomic differences indexing disrupted synaptogenesis. Systemic and CSF proteomic and metabolomic changes were present and concurrent in the pre-anemic and anemic periods. Multiomic serum and CSF profiling uncovered pathways disrupted by ID in both the pre-anemic and anemic stages of infantile IDA, including evidence for hepatic dysfunction and activation of acute phase response. Parallel changes observed in serum and CSF potentially provide measurable serum biomarkers of ID that reflect at-risk brain processes prior to progression to clinical anemia.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Data availability:</strong></p><p>The proteomics data have been deposited into the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository with the data set identifier <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD028275' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>PXD028275</a>.</p>",

                        "description": "<p><strong>Animals</strong></p><p>A prospective cohort study was conducted with 19 mother-reared infant rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) beginning at 4-months of age. All were from singleton, full-term pregnancies and vaginally delivered, born to different mothers and raised with standardized husbandry and dietary conditions as previously described<strong>[1]-[5]</strong>. ID in this naturalistic model is due to lower iron stores at birth and a growth-related depletion of iron reserves during the period of nursing. At 4- and 6-months of age, <strong>blood </strong>and <strong>CSF </strong>samples were collected to acquire traditional hematological indicators and to conduct metabolomic and proteomic analyses. Proteomic analysis was limited to 6 representative ID and 6 matched IS samples per fluid compartment and time point in order to achieve statistically balanced groups and within sample constraints. Experimental procedures were approved by the institutional Animal Care and Use Committees at the University of Wisconsin and the University of Minnesota.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Housing and Diet</strong></p><p>Adult female rhesus monkeys were fed a standardized commercial diet (<strong>Table S1</strong> in the paper associated with this study) (5LFD; LabDiet, St. Louis, MO) while pregnant and nursing, which was supplemented with fresh fruit and vegetables<strong>[4]</strong>. This diet contains adequate iron (225 mg/kg) for an adult non-pregnant monkey, but does not fully meet the additional iron requirements of a gravid female<strong>[3]</strong>. Approximately 20-30% of the infants born to dams fed this diet will spontaneously develop IDA by 6-months due to their lower iron stores at birth and insufficient iron in breast milk to support growth-related needs during the rapid growth phase. ID in this model does not result in a slowing or stunting of growth, and it is often the larger, fast-growing infant that becomes anemic. ID in this model does not result in a slowing or stunting of growth, and it is often the larger, fast growing infant that becomes anemic similar to human children<strong>[6]</strong>. Prior validations of this ID model demonstrated that anemic infants have lower serum iron, transferrin saturation and ferritin levels when compared with IS infants<strong>[5][7]</strong>. The model thus mimics common human rearing conditions where a lower gestational iron endowment predisposes to postnatal ID and neurodevelopmental effects<strong>[8][9]</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Specimen Collection</strong></p><p><strong>Blood </strong>and <strong>CSF </strong>samples were collected in the morning, between 09:00-10:00 h. <strong>Blood </strong>samples (&lt;3 mL) were obtained via femoral venipuncture and tested individually; samples were not pooled. <strong>CSF </strong>(0.5-1.0 mL) was collected via cervical tap using a sterile 1.0 mL syringe with a 25-gauge needle after the monkey had been quickly sedated with ketamine (15 mg/kg). To provide further analgesia beyond the initial anesthesia, meloxicam was administered subcutaneously post-procedure. <strong>CSF </strong>was placed on ice, centrifuged and the upper fraction stored in an ultracold freezer at -70 \u00b0C. <strong>Sera </strong>and <strong>CSF </strong>were shipped on dry ice to the University of Minnesota for analysis.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs</strong>:</p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Geguchadze RN, Coe CL, Lubach GR, Clardy TW, Beard JL, Connor JR.

After data analysis and identification of metabolites of interest fragmentation (MS2) studies were performed to assist in identification and quantification of metabolites of interest. For MS2 tandem mass spectra runs a target inclusion list of m/z values of interest was imported. Fragmentation by higher-energy collisional dissociation with stepped normalized collision energy of 30 and 60, a detector setting of 17.5 k resolution, AGC 1 x e^5 ions and 100 ms maximum injection time was used.

QC samples generated from a pooled sample stock were run at regular intervals. Comparison of metabolite abundances from pooled samples interspersed across the entire experimental run were used to filter the raw data. Peaks of insufficient width to allow accurate quantitation were removed. Features displaying high variation (i.e., coefficient of variation score above 20%) across the pooled samples were removed. Features were retained if abundance estimates were at least 5-fold higher in QC samples above blank samples.</p>",

Briefly, a precursor match within 10 ppm mass accuracy, a retention time within 0.1 min of our in-house library and a MS/MS forward search dot-product score of at least 700. Agreement of these three pieces of evidence lead to a high confident identification match in the absence of internal standards. In addition, isotope distribution information and MS/MS fragmentation spectral comparisons were employed for metabolite identification.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Smith CA, O'Maille G, Want EJ, Qin C, Trauger SA, Brandon TR, Custodio DE, Abagyan R, Siuzdak G.
