                "description": "The gut microbiota plays an important role in parasite-host interactions and the induction of immune defense responses. Trichinella spiralis is an important zoonotic parasite that can directly or indirectly interact with the host in the gut. Changes in the gut microbiota following infection with T. spiralis and the role of the gut microbiota in host immune defense against T. spiralis infection were investigated in our study. 16S rRNA sequencing analysis revealed that infection with T. spiralis can reduce the diversity of the gut microbiota and alter the structure of the gut microbiota during early infection, which was restored when the worm left the gut. Antibiotic treatment (ABX) and fecal bacterial transplantation (FMT) were used to investigate the role of the gut microbiota in the host expulsion response during infection with T. spiralis. We found that ABX mice had a higher burden of parasites, and the burden of parasites decreased after fecal bacterial transplantation. The results of flow cytometry and qPCR revealed that the disturbance of the gut microbiota affects the proportion of CD4+ T cells and the production of IL-4, which weakens Th2 responses and makes expulsion difficult. In addition, as the inflammatory response decreased with the change of the microbiota, the Th1 response also decreased. The metabolomic results were in good agreement with these findings, as the levels of inflammatory metabolites such as ceramides were reduced in the ABX group. In general, T. spiralis infection can cause changes in the gut microbiota, and the presence or absence of microbes may also weaken intestinal inflammation and the expulsion of T. spiralis by affecting the immune response of the host.",

Brielfy, 30 mg of sample was added to a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube, with 20 \u03bcL of Lyso PC 17:0 (0.1 mg/mL) dissolved in methanol as an internal standard, and then 300 \u03bcL methanol:water (1/1, v/v) solution was added. Next 2 small steel balls were added to each tube, and the mixed was pre-cooled at -20 \u00b0C for 2 min, and then added to a grinder (60 Hz, 2 min). Then, 300 \u03bcL of chloroform was added to each sample, and the mixtures were vortexed for 30 s, extracted by ultrasonication for 10 min in ice-water bath, then placed at -20 \u00b0C for 20 min, and centrifuged at 4 \u00b0C (13,443 x g) for 10 min before 200 \u03bcL of the chloroform layer was decanted into sample vials. Then, 300 \u03bcL chloroform:methanol (2/1, v/v, with 0.1 mM BHT) solution was added to the residue of the samples, and the sample was vortexed for 30 s, extracted by ultrasonication for 10 min in ice-water bath, placed at -20 \u00b0C for 20 min, and then centrifuged at 4 \u00b0C (15,777 x g) for 10 min prior to decanting the chloroform layer to sample vials. The two subnatant fractions were combined and mixed well. Then, the mixed subnatant (100 \u03bcL) was dried under a nitrogen stream and re-dissolved in 200 \u03bcL of an isopropanol:methanol (1/1, v/v) solution, the mixture was vortexed for 30 s and extraction was performed by ultrasonication for 3 min in an ice-water bath. The solution was transferred to a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube and incubated for 2 h at -20 \u00b0C. After centrifugation for 10 min (13,443 x g, 4 \u00b0C), 150 \u03bcL supernatant was taken and placed into a liquid chromatography-mas spectrometry (LC-MS) injection vial with a linear tube for subsequent ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) analysis. Quality control (QC) samples were prepared by mixing aliquots of the sample to generate a pooled sample. All chemicals and solvents were analytical or high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) grade. Water, methanol, acetonitrile, isopropanol, and formic acid were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Ammonium formate, and chloroform were obtained from Titan Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd (Shanghai, China). Lyso PC 17:0 was purchased from Avanti.</p>",

The molecular structures of lipids and the additive mode of their positive and negative ions were identified according to the parent ions and multi-stage mass spectrometry data obtained from each individual sample. The results were aligned according to a certain retention time range and combined into a single report to sort out the original data matrix. In each sample, all peak signals were normalized (that is, the signal intensity of each peak is converted to the relative intensity in the spectrum, and then multiplied by 10000). The extracted data were then further processed by removing any peaks with a missing value (ion intensity = 0) in more than 50% in groups and by replacing zeros with half of the minimum value. A data matrix was combined from the positive and negative ion data. The matrix was imported into R to carry out Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to observe the overall distribution among the samples and the stability of the whole analysis process. Orthogonal Partial Least-Squares-Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA) and Partial Least-Squares-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) were utilized to distinguish the metabolites that differed between groups. To prevent overfitting, 7-fold cross-validation and 200 Response Testing (RPT) were used to evaluate the quality of the model. Variable Importance of Projection (VIP) values obtained from the OPLS-DA model were used to rank the overall contribution of each variable to group discrimination. A two-tailed Student\u2019s T-test was further used to verify whether the metabolites of difference between groups were significant. Differential metabolites were selected with VIP values greater than 1.0 and p-values less than 0.05.</p>",
