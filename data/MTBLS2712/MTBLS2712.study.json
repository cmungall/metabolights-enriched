                "description": "<p>BolA has been characterized as an important transcriptional regulator, which is induced in the stationary phase of growth and&nbsp;is often associated with bacterial virulence. This study was initiated to elucidate the role of the BolA in the virulence of <em>K. pneumoniae</em>.&nbsp;Using a mouse infection model, we revealed bolA&nbsp;mutant strain yielded significantly decreased bacterial loads in&nbsp;liver, spleen, lung and kidney, and failed to form liver abscesses.&nbsp;Gene deletion demonstrated that&nbsp;the bolA&nbsp;is required for siderophore production, biofilm formation and adhesion to human colon cancer epithelial cells HCT116. Quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-qPCR) indicated&nbsp;that BolA is able to impact the expression of pulK, pulF,&nbsp;pulE, clpV, vgrG, entE, relA&nbsp;and spoT&nbsp;genes on a genome-wide scale, which are related to&nbsp;type II secretion system (T2SS), type VI secretion system (T6SS), guanosine tetraphosphate (ppGpp) and siderophore&nbsp;synthesis&nbsp;and contributes to fitness in the host.&nbsp;Furthermore, the metabolome analysis showed that the deletion of the&nbsp;bolA&nbsp;gene led to decreased pools of 5 metabolites: biotin, spermine, cadaverine, guanosine and flavin adenine dinucleotide, all of which are involved in pathways related to virulence and stress resistance. Taken together, we provided evidence that BolA is a significant virulence factor in the ability of <em>K. pneumoniae</em>&nbsp;to survive and this is an important step in progress to an understanding of the pathways underlying bacterial virulence.</p>",

All isolates were identified by Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry (Bruker Daltonik, Bremen, Germany).&nbsp;All bacterial strains were stored at -80 \u00b0C&nbsp;in&nbsp;LB medium containing 25 % glycerol.&nbsp;The&nbsp;pKO3-Km plasmid&nbsp;was used to generate bolA&nbsp;mutant strains&nbsp;through homologous recombination. Unless otherwise stated, <em>K. pneumoniae</em>&nbsp;cultures were grown in LB&nbsp;medium, M9 (Na2HPO4&nbsp;6.8 g/L; KH2PO4&nbsp;3.0 g/L; NaCl 0.5 g/L; NH4Cl 1.0 g/L; 0.6 % glucose&nbsp;medium) medium or on LB agar at 30, 37 or 43 \u00b0C&nbsp;and supplemented with Kanamycin (Km, 50 or 25 \u03bcg/mL) where required. Bacterial growth was monitored by measuring the optical density at 595 nm. For growth curves,&nbsp;overnight cultures were diluted 1:100 in LB or M9 medium and cultured at 37 \u00b0C&nbsp;for 12 h. The OD595&nbsp;values were measured by microplate reader at 1 h intervals.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Scanning electron microscopy&nbsp;(SEM)</strong></p><p>The SEM&nbsp;was performed to investigate the effect of BolA&nbsp;on bacterial cell morphology. Briefly, the supernatants were discarded after bacterial cultures were centrifuged. Bacterial cells were fixed overnight&nbsp;at 4 \u00b0C&nbsp;in 2.5 % glutaraldehyde. After washing them with PBS&nbsp;3x times,&nbsp;they were dehydrated by gradient incubation and finally suspended in anhydrous ethanol. Drops of the bacterial suspension were applied to a glass coverslip, dried and covered with chromium. Finally, bacterial cells were observed and photographed.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Biofilm formation assays</strong></p><p>The biofilm formation assays were performed to investigate whether BolA affects the biofilm formation ability of <em>K. pneumoniae</em>. The overnight bacteria cultures were diluted to approximately 10^8 CFU/mL (CFU, Colony-Forming Unit), and 200 \u03bcL of the diluted cultures were added to the 96-well polystyrene plate and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 48 h. Each well was washed with 200 \u03bcL PBS 3x to remove planktonic bacteria. After staining with 0.1 % crystal violet for 25 min, the crystal violet was washed thoroughly with PBS and the 96-well polystyrene plate was dried at room temperature. Then, 200 \u03bcL of anhydrous ethanol was added into each well to dissolve crystal violet and the biofilm&nbsp;thickness was estimated by measuring the absorbance of dissolved dye at 595 nm (OD595)<strong>[1]</strong>.&nbsp;Each assay was performed in triplicate and repeated 4x times.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>CAS agar assays for iron uptake</strong></p><p>In order to elucidate the role of the BolA&nbsp;in the virulence of K. pneumoniae, CAS agar plate to detect the formation of siderophores were performed as described in the previously published articles[<strong>2][3]</strong>. In brief,&nbsp;it is prepared by first dissolving 60.5 mg of CAS powder (Yuanye Bio-Technology, China) in 50 mL of double-distilled water (ddH2O), and then adding 10 mL of 1 mM solution of FeCl3&nbsp;(Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd, Shanghai). Then, 72.9 mg hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (HDTMA; Yuanye Bio-Technology,&nbsp;China)&nbsp;was added to 40 mL ddH2O. Finally, 100 mL of the CAS stock solution made from the HDTMA solution was slowly poured into the CAS solution under stirring and autoclaved. Next,&nbsp;the freshly autoclaved 1.5 % agar LB plate and CAS stock solution were mixed&nbsp;at a ratio of 9:1 to make a CAS agar plate. Then, 2 \u03bcL overnight bacterial cultures were inoculated on the CAS plate and cultivated at 28 \u00b0C. The CAS plate was photographed after 48 h&nbsp;of cultivation. The assay was repeated 3x times.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>G. mellonella</em> larvae&nbsp;killing&nbsp;assay</strong></p><p>To evaluate the role of the BolA in the virulence of <em>K. pneumoniae</em>, we used the <em>G. mellonella</em> larvae for <em>K. pneumoniae</em> infection.&nbsp;Briefly, <em>K. pneumoniae</em> strains were prepared by harvesting exponential phase bacterial cultures, washing twice in PBS,&nbsp;then adjusting to 1 x&nbsp;10^7&nbsp;CFU.&nbsp;Groups of larvae (n = 10) were injected with 10 \u03bcL of working bacterial suspension at the last proleg using a hypodermic microsyringe. For each assay,&nbsp;a group of larvae was injected with PBS as a control. Injected larvae were placed in petri dishes at 37 \u00b0C&nbsp;for 72 h in the dark. The percent survival was recorded at 24 h intervals.&nbsp;<em>G. mellonella</em> larvae were considered dead if they did not respond to physical stimuli. Assays were repeated 3x times.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Mice infection experiments</strong></p><p>The&nbsp;mouse septicemia infection model was used to observe the colonization of bacteria in mouse tissues&nbsp;to&nbsp;evaluate the role of the BolA in the virulence of <em>K. pneumoniae</em>. First, 10-week-old female BALB/c mice (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;5 in each group) were used for infections. Bacterial cells (the wild type and the bolA mutant strains) were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in sterile normal saline (NS). Mice were infected by intraperitoneal injection of the bacterial suspension (1 x&nbsp;10^4&nbsp;CFU&nbsp;<em>K. pneumoniae</em> per mouse). After 24 h, the mice were euthanized and organs (including liver, spleen, kidney and lung) were homogenized in NS, and then appropriate dilutions were plated onto LB agar for CFU counts. Second, 8-week-old female BALB/c mice (4 per group) were infected by intraperitoneal injection with&nbsp;<em>K. pneumoniae</em>&nbsp;at a dose of 2 x 10^3&nbsp;CFUs per mouse for 120 h. The livers were retrieved, fixed in 10 % formalin and embedded in paraffin blocks. The tissue sections were stained with hematoxylin-eosin and were imaged and quantified under a light microscope. The number of abscesses was quantified in 5 low-power fields (magnification, x40).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1] </strong>Vieira HL, Freire P, Arraiano CM.

The information in this three-dimensional matrix includes: sample information, metabolite name and mass spectral response intensity. Internal standard peaks, as well as any known false positive peaks (including noise, column bleed and derivatized reagent peaks), were removed from the data matrix, deredundant and peak pooled. The metabolites were searched and identified, and the main database was <strong>HMDB</strong> (<a href='https://hmdb.ca/' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>https://hmdb.ca/</a>), <strong>METLIN</strong> (<a href='https://metlin.scripps.edu/' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>https://metlin.scripps.edu/</a>) and <strong>Majorbio</strong> database. The data after the database search is uploaded to the <strong>Majorbio</strong> <strong>cloud</strong> <strong>platform</strong> (<a href='https://cloud.majorbio.com' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>https://cloud.majorbio.com</a>) for data analysis. Metabolic features detected at least 80 % in any set of samples were retained. After filtering, minimum metabolite values were imputed for specific samples in which the metabolite levels fell below the lower limit of quantitation and each metabolic features were normalized by sum. In order to reduce the errors caused by sample preparation and instrument instability, the response intensity of the sample mass spectrum peaks was normalized by the sum normalization method, and the normalized data matrix was obtained. At the same time, variables with relative standard deviation (RSD) &gt; 30% of QC samples were removed, and log10 logarithmization was performed to obtain the final data matrix for subsequent analysis.</p><p><br></p><p>Differential metabolites were mapped into their biochemical pathways through metabolic enrichment and pathway analysis based on database search <strong>KEGG</strong> (<a href='https://www.genome.jp/kegg/' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>https://www.genome.jp/kegg/</a>). These metabolites can be classified according to the pathways they involved or the functions they performed.&nbsp;Enrichment analysis was usually to analyze a group of metabolites in a function node whether appears or not. The principle was&nbsp;that the annotation analysis of a single metabolite develops into an annotation analysis of a group of metabolites.&nbsp;In <strong>python</strong> <strong>scipy.stats</strong>&nbsp;(<a href='https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/</a>) was&nbsp;exploited to identify statistically significantly enriched pathway using Fisher\u2019s exact test.</p>",
