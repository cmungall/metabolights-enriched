                "description": "High-mass-resolution imaging mass spectrometry promises to localize hundreds of metabolites directly from tissues, cell cultures, and agar plates with cellular resolution, but is hampered by the lack of bioinformatics for automated metabolite identification. We developed the first bioinformatics framework for False Discovery Rate (FDR)-controlled metabolite annotation for high-mass-resolution imaging mass spectrometry (https://github.com/alexandrovteam/pySM) introducing a Metabolite-Signal Match (MSM) score and a target-decoy FDR-estimate for spatial metabolomics. MALDI-FTICR datasets acquired from wild type adult mouse brain were used for the development of spatial metabolomics annotation bioinformatics. This study together with MTBLS317 and MTBLS378 provide the accompanying data for FDR-controlled metabolite annotation for high-resolution imaging mass spectrometry.",

The x-y raster width was set to 50 \u03bcm using smartbeam II laser optics with the laser focus setting \u2018small\u2019 (20-30 \u03bcm). For a pixel, a spectrum was accumulated from 10 laser shots. The laser was running at 1000 Hz and the ions were accumulated externally (hexapole) before being transferred into the ICR cell for a single scan. For animal a1, each spectrum was internally calibrated by one-point correction using a known phospholipid with the ion C42H82NO8P+K+, at the m/z 798.540963. For animal a2, every spectrum was internally calibrated by several point correction using: matrix cluster of HCCA [C20H14N2O6+H+, m/z 379.092462] if present and known phospholipids present in the mouse brain [C40H80NO8P+H+, m/z 734.569432] and [C42H82NO8P+K+, m/z 798.540963]. Data was acquired for the mass range 100 < m/z < 1200 followed by a single zero filling and a sin-apodization. Online feature reduction was performed in the ftmsControl software, version 2.1.0 (Bruker Daltonics) to return only the peak centroids and intensities.\n",
