                "description": "This work introduces a novel online Headspace-Solid Phase Microextraction-Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry-based untargeted metabolomics approach, suggested as an alternative tool to study the environmental fate of volatile xenometabolites in emerging complex biopesticides, e.g. the Myrica gale methanolic extract herbicide containing several unknown metabolites. A 'living' microcosm sample was designed for non-destructive analysis by a 35-min HS-SPME automated extraction and a 36-min GC-MS run. A 38-day kinetics study was then applied on two groups of soil samples: control and spiked. Statistical tools were used for the comparative kinetics study. The Principal Component Analysis revealed and explained the evolution and the dissipation of the herbicide volatile xenometabolome over time. The time-series Heatmap and Multivariate Empirical Bayes Analysis of Variance allowed the prioritization of 101 relevant compounds including 22 degradation by-products. Out of them, 96 xenometabolites were putatively identified. They included 63 compounds that are identified as herbicide components for the first time. The Orthogonal Projections to Latent Structures Discriminant Analysis and its Cross-Validation test were used to assess the total dissipation of the herbicide volatile residues and method detection limit. The reproducibility of the method was also assessed. The highest inter-samples (n\u00a0=\u00a03) Peak Area RSD was 7.75 %. The highest inter-samples (n\u00a0=\u00a03) and inter-days (n\u00a0=\u00a08) Retention Time SD were 0.43\u00a0sec and 3.44\u00a0sec, respectively. The work presents a green, non-laborious and high-throughput approach. It required a small number of environmental samples (6 microcosms) that were analyzed 8 times and were not destroyed during the study.",

                        "description": "<p><strong>Soil material:</strong></p><p>Soil sample was collected from an arable field at the agricultural domain of the 'Institut Universitaire de Technologie' (IUT) of Perpignan, France (42\u00b040\u203255.1'N 2\u00b053\u203251.2'E). The surface layer (15 cm) of soil was collected on 3 different points separated by 1.5 m. After collection, the soil was homogenized and passed through a 2 mm sieve. Then, it was stocked in the dark at 4 \u00b0C until the experiment. The soil composition analysis and characterization were performed by Arterris Laboratory (Toulouges, France) accredited by the French Accreditation Committee (Cofrac). Results were the following: 13.9% of clay, 60.5% of silt, 25.6% of sand, 20% of soil humidity, 1.7% of organic matter, 0.98% of organic Carbon, 15.5 meq 100/g cation exchange capacity (CEC), 214% Ca2+/CEC and pH of 8.1 in water. According to the Soil Textural Triangle of the United States Department of Agriculture<strong>[1]</strong>, this soil is classified as a silt loam soil. It was never been contaminated or exposed to herbicides.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Chemicals:</strong></p><p>Methanol HPLC grade was purchased from VWR International (Fontenay-sous-Bois, France). The dry methanolic extract of Myrica gale was prepared as previously described<strong>[2]</strong>. The spiking herbicide solution for application on soil samples was prepared at a concentration of 72 mg/ml of dry extract dissolved in Methanol (containing 18 mg/ml of the bioactive compound Myrigalone A). C7-C30 Saturated Alkanes mix (1000 mg/ml of each component in Hexane) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Saint-Quentin-Fallavier, France).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Soil samples set-up:</strong></p><p>Samples consisted of 6 g of soil weighted in 20 ml HS-SPME vials (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Courtab\u0153uf, France). This weight was optimized in order to keep 2/3 of the vial volume as headspace. After, vials were hermetically closed by a crimped septum, and 2x 18G x 1 1\u20442' (1.2 x 38 mm) Agani needles (Terumo, Leuven, Belgium) were implanted on the extremity sides of the septum (see <strong>Fig. A1</strong> in the paper associated with this study). This is to assure aerobic conditions by allowing air exchange between the internal headspace and the outside. The prepared soil vials were incubated in a GC 401 growth chamber (Nuve, Saracalar, Turkey) for 24 h before the spiking in order to reestablish the biological and microbial activity. Incubation conditions were 24 h day/night cycle with alternation of light/dark, 28 \u00b0C/18 \u00b0C of temperature, and 40% RH/65% RH of humidity (see <strong>Fig. A2</strong> in the paper associated with this study). The soil moisture was maintained at 20% during the incubation and throughout the experiment, following a standardized environmental protocol implemented and published in previous works <strong>[3][4]</strong>, aiming to assure conditions that are comparable to real environmental cases. The aim of implementing this sample design was to assure a 'living system'. As mentioned previously, samples will be used for several kinetic time points, so measures were taken to ensure that they will not be destroyed during the study.</p><p><br></p><p>The preparation of herbicide-spiked soil samples was performed by applying the Myrica gale methanolic extract with a dose equivalent to 300 mg of the active compound (Myrigalone A) per gram of soil (1.2 mg of dry Myrica gale methanolic extract per gram of soil). This corresponds to 10x the agronomical field dose, following testing guidelines recommendations<strong>[5][6]</strong> in order to assess their transformation and risks on health and environment in an extreme pollution scenario<strong>[4]</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Application for a kinetics study:</strong></p><p>After all analytical conditions were optimized and set-up, a 38-day kinetics tracking study was conducted to prove the concept of the suggested approach. The studied environmental samples consisted of 2 different groups of soil vials/microcosms (described above) with 3 replicates of each: an untreated control soil (UnTr), and an herbicide-spiked soil (MyrN). After spiking, samples were incubated in the growth chamber with the day/night cycle conditions mentioned above, in order to imitate natural conditions for herbicide transformation in soil.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Soil Science Division Staff. 2017.

Data were acquired in RAW format and then converted to ANDI format (NetCDF) in order to upload and process them using Galaxy Workflow4Metabolomics platform<strong>[1]-[3]</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p>The automated processing workflow used the metaMS package (Galaxy Version 2.1.1)<strong>[4]</strong> dedicated for GC-MS data. All of its conditions and parameters were previously published<strong>[5]</strong>. In brief, a 'matchedFilter' algorithm was used for peak piking, with a Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) of 5 (Gaussian model peak)<strong>[6]</strong>. In addition, GC-MS peaks were considered for peak piking only if: i) their pseudo-spectra contained a minimum of 5 m/z features, ii) if these peaks were present in at least 70% of samples belonging to a defined condition. Between the different injections/runs, the similarity threshold between peaks pseudo-spectra was set to 0.7, and maximum peak Retention Time (RT) variation was set to 15 s in order to prevent any potential splitting of a metabolite feature into 2 different features. After generating the data matrix, statistical analyses were performed using the R-based MetaboAnalyst platform<strong>[7]-[9]</strong>. Xcalibur 4.1.31.9 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, U.S.) and AMDIS 2.72 (National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, U.S.) were used for the deconvolution of MS spectra and the manual data processing to cross-check the results obtained by the automated processing. Compass DataAnalysis 4.3 (Bruker Daltonik GmbH, Bremen, Germany) was used for EIC peak area integration and for counting molecular features' number. NIST 14 library search for putative identification of compounds was performed using NIST MS Search 2.2 (National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, U.S.). Welch Two Sample T-test for independent means comparison was performed using the R Commander 2.4-2 'Rcmdr' package<strong>[10]</strong> of R 3.3.3 software.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Galaxy Workflow4Metabolomics, Galaxy Workflow4Metabolomics.
