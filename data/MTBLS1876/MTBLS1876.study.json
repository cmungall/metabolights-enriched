                "description": "We propose a fully automated novel workflow for lipidomics based on flow injection, followed by liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry (FI/LC-HRMS). The workflow combined in-depth characterization of the lipidome achieved via reversed-phase LC-HRMS with absolute quantification by using a large number of lipid species-specific and/or retention time (RT)-matched/class-specific calibrants. The lipidome of 13C-labelled yeast (LILY) provided a large panel of cost-effective internal standards (ISTDs) covering triacylglycerols (TG), steryl esters (SE), free fatty acids (FA), diacylglycerols (DG), sterols (ST), ceramides (Cer), hexosyl ceramides (HexCer), phosphatidylglycerols (PG), phosphatidylethanolamines (PE), phosphatidic acids (PA), cardiolipins (CL), phosphatidylinositols (PI), phosphatidylserines (PS), phosphatidylcholines (PC), lysophosphatidylcholines (LPC) and lysophosphatidylethanolamines (LPE). The workflow in combination with the LILY lipid panel enables simultaneous quantification via (1) external multi-point calibration with internal standardization and (2) internal one-point calibration with LILY as a surrogate ISTD, increasing the coverage while keeping the accuracy and throughput high. Extensive measures on quality control allowed us to rank the calibration strategies and to automatically select the calibration strategy of the highest metrological order for the respective lipid species. Overall, the workflow enabled a streamlined analysis, with a limit of detection in the low femtomolar range, and provided validation tools together with absolute concentration values for >350 lipids in human plasma on a species level. Based on the selected standard panel, lipids from 7 classes (LPC, LPE, PC, PE, PI, DG, TG) passed stringent quality filters, which included QC accuracy, a precision and recovery bias of <30% and concentrations within the 99% confidence interval of the international laboratory comparison of SRM 1950, NIST, USA. The quantitative values are independent of common deuterated or non-endogenous ISTDs, thus offering cross-validation of different lipid methods and further standardizing lipidomics.",

The mixture was shaken for 1 h at room temperature. Phase separation was induced by adding 625 \u00b5L of MS-grade water. Upon 10 min of incubation, the sample was centrifuged at 1,000 rcf for 10 min. The upper (organic) phase was collected in a 5 mL microcentrifuge tube. The phase was dried under nitrogen and stored at -20 \u00b0C if necessary. The dried lipids were dissolved in 200 \u00b5L IPA, centrifuged at 1,000 rcf for 10 min and transferred into an insert in a HPLC vial. 10 \u00b5L of each sample was pooled in a glass vial with insert to obtain a sample pool for lipid identification.

A transition list was uploaded to Skyline in the molecule interface containing all possible analytes, ESTDs and ISTDs. All MS1 files were imported and peak boundaries were chosen manually.

The identifications were curated manually following the criteria published elsewhere.

The converted <strong>mzML </strong>files were imported via <strong>LipidXplorer </strong>into a Master Scan database using following settings: mass tolerance 5&nbsp;ppm&nbsp;(MS1)/&nbsp;0.02&nbsp;Da&nbsp;(MS2), min. occupation of 0, intensity threshold 0&nbsp;(MS1)/&nbsp;0&nbsp;(MS2), resolution 230,000&nbsp;(MS1)/&nbsp;60,000&nbsp;(MS2), resolution gradient -90&nbsp;(MS1)/&nbsp;-20&nbsp;(MS2) in positive mode and -170&nbsp;(MS1)/&nbsp;-40&nbsp;(MS2). The molecular fragmentation query language (MFQL) files used for identification can be found in the <strong>publication supplementary</strong> in the paper associated with this study. The Reporting of all MFQL files needs to be equal for further <strong>R </strong>data evaluation. The following information was reported:</p><p>MASS (m/z value), CHEMSC (formula of ion), FORMULA (formula of neutral lipid species), ERROR (mass error between accurate and exact mass), CLASS (lipid class), NAME (shorthand notation), SPECIES (shorthand notation on fatty acyl chain level), ISOBARIC (occurrence of isobaric overlaps with other identified lipids), PRINTENS (intensity of precursor ion), depending on lipid class: Head intensity/fatty acid (FA) intensity, Headmass/FAmass, Headerror/FAerror. The data was exported as csv-file.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Absolute Lipid Quantification:</strong></p><p>All data processing was performed in <strong>R/ R studio</strong>. It is crucial to use a standardized file labelling throughout the whole experiment (see <strong>publication supplementary</strong> in the paper associated with this study).&nbsp;From the Skyline export, information about the file and the analyte were added from the file name or the formula, blank values and the stability of the QC area and retention time was calculated and filtered by certain thresholds as well as the area was deisotoping Type 1 corrected. To control the retention time and the lipid identification, <strong>LipidSearch </strong>data was integrated and mismatching lipids were reported for manual control.</p><p>The csv export from <strong>LipidXplorer </strong>was transformed, information was added as with the <strong>Skyline </strong>data, average blank values for each analyte were calculated and could be subtracted if needed, the intensity stability of the lipids in the QC were controlled and deisotoping Type I and Type II (adopted script published by Triebl et al.<strong>[1]</strong>) were performed. Only the standards containing ESTD at different concentration levels and LILY as ISTD with a constant conc. were further used to calculate the concentration of the LILY lipids itself via concentration matched multipoint calibration.</p><p><br></p><p>To enable always the most accurate quantification strategy for each analyte, a specific decision tree for the automated choice of internal lipid standards was implemented (see <strong>publication supplementary </strong>in the paper associated with this study). In the first step, calibrants from the RP-LC data were used to produce a multipoint calibration curve without the use of internal standards. With these calibration curves, accuracy and precision of the QCs was calculated and incorrect substances were removed as ESTD to avoid the use of incorrect ESTD. If concentration of QCs was met, these ESTD were further used for internal standardized quantification as well as the calculation of the final sample concentrations for lipids, where LILY cannot offer a labeled ISTD (e.g. AcCa, SM and Hex2Cer) [termed: ESTD only]. In general, multipoint calibrations were always performed by selecting the 6 closest calibration levels for each analyte area. This was also the case for the internal standardized multipoint calibration for all ESTD matched with the closest ISTD by RT [termed: Multipoint]. For an easier nomenclature, the 3 levels definition of the <strong>Lipidomics Standard Initiative </strong>(<strong>LSI</strong>) (see <strong>publication supplementary</strong> in the paper associated with this study) was used for ESTD and ISTD and only Level 1 or 2 were selected here. By quantifying the LILY lipids intra-daily via DI-HRMS and RP-LC-HRMS, all ISTD can be used for RT-matched internal standardized 1-point calibration avoiding level 3 standards to quantify all other analytes. LILY was quantified via multipoint calibration via DI-HRMS data [termed: DI-RP 1-point] or via RP-LC-HRMS data [termed: RP 1-point] if it co-elutes with an ESTD in RP-LC or was not detected in DI-HRMS.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref</strong>:</p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Triebl A, Burla B, Selvalatchmanan J, Oh J, Tan SH, Chan MY, Mellet NA, Meikle PJ, Torta F, Wenk MR.
