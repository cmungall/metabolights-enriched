                "description": "<p>Leaf samples were obtained from Vitis vinifera \u2018Malvasia Fina\u2019 plants with well-characterized esca complex disease symptoms (n\u202f=\u202f18) and from healthy uninfected plants (n\u202f=\u202f6). Leaves from diseased plants were divided into three groups: asymptomatic (ASY), chlorotic (SY1), and scorched leaves (SY2). The metabolic profile of these leaves was then examined using an ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography system coupled to a Q-Exactive Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap high resolution/accurate mass spectrometer interfaced with a heated electrospray ionization source. The number of small molecules measured in a sample was increased by varying the reconstitution solvent, chromatographic column, and ionization source. Data on accurate masses, peak areas, and relative levels of several metabolites were documented for each leaf sample, using the abovementioned approach. In this paper, data on 235 metabolites of known structural identity are reported, along with the biochemical pathways to which the metabolites belong. The remaining data related to lipid species and with a different focus of the research question are reported elsewhere. The broad coverage of metabolites reported here resulted in a greater coverage of the biochemical pathways involved in grapevine metabolism, which could provide a better understanding of the biochemical changes occurring during the onset and progression of foliar symptoms after invasion of woods by esca-associated pathogens. To determine which metabolites varied according to the study design, the detected ion features were processed using different statistical methods, including mean and median values, fold changes, Welch's two-sample t-test, false discovery rate, and quartiles represented by box and whisker plots. The goal of this statistical evaluation was to assess the responses of healthy, asymptomatic, and symptomatic leaf groups using a pairwise comparison, thus providing an opportunity for detecting statistically significant compounds and uncovering the dynamic metabolic models underlying disease latency and symptom expression.</p>",

                        "description": "<p><strong>Characteristics of the study site:</strong></p><p>Samples used for global metabolomic analyses were collected in a vineyard naturally infected by ESCA-associated pathogens. The vineyard, called <strong>Quinta de Nossa Senhora de Lourdes</strong> (465 m, 41\u00b0 17.12\u2019 31\u2019\u2019 N, 7\u00b0 44.07\u2019 22\u2019\u2019 W), is in the city of <strong>Vila Real</strong> in <strong>Portugal</strong>. In the immediate surroundings of the vineyard are 3 other vineyards with different cultivars (north, west and east) separated from each other by roads, and a cherry field (south). The vineyard was planted on an area of 2,700 m^2 in 1995 with <em>V. vinifera L. \u2018Malvasi-Fina\u2019</em> grafted on 196-17-Castel rootstock. Malvasia-Fina, also known as Boal, is a white grape cultivar grown historically in Portugal. Initially, the vineyard had 1247 vines organized in 22 rows. With time, some vines have been uprooted for studies and some have died; missing vines have not been replanted. The distance between the rows is 1.80 m for 1.12 m spacing between vines in the row. Different training systems are used for canopy management. Based on observations of leaf symptoms during the last decade, ESCA is the main disease in the vineyard<strong>[1][2]</strong>. However, the main cause of vine death is suspected to be Armillaria root rot. </p><p><br></p><p>In the sampling year, vines were grown in the field at an average annual air temperature of 13.97 \u00b0C with 75% relative humidity and a 16-h photoperiod (1350 \u03bcmol/m^2/s). Precipitation was limited with 880.7 mm average rainfall and the vineyard had no irrigation system. The soil (Anthrosol) was uniform across the experimental plot and was characterized by 62% sand, 25% silt, and 13% clay (pH 4.2). Pruning, fertilization and plant protection measures were undertaken according to Plant care guidelines developed by <strong>Universidade de Tr\u00e1s-os-Montes e Alto Douro.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Definition of experimental groups:</strong></p><p>The sampling protocol was developed using 4 rows of vines (a block of 243 vines) facing north and trained to a bilateral cordon according to the royal-type trellis system. An inspection period of 6 continuous years gave sufficient time to identify all the vines showing internal and external signs of ESCA in the study block.</p><p><br></p><p>Affected vines were characterized as having diverse shapes and colors of wood and leaf deterioration and necrosis, and were grouped into I, II, III, and IV. <strong>Group I</strong> comprised of healthy unaffected control vines (<strong>CTL</strong>). <strong>Group II</strong> comprised of wood-symptomatic and foliar-asymptomatic vines (<strong>ASY</strong>). <strong>Group III</strong> comprised of wood-symptomatic and foliar-symptomatic vines (<strong>SY1</strong>) with brown wood streaking that have continuously expressed tiger stripe-like foliar symptoms (<strong>symptom severity level 1</strong>). <strong>Group IV</strong> also comprised of wood-symptomatic and foliar-symptomatic vines (<strong>SY2</strong>) with brown wood streaking that have continuously expressed tiger stripe-like foliar symptoms (<strong>symptom severity level 2</strong>).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Collection of leaf samples:</strong></p><p>For each of the experimental groups, 10 vines were identified. Approx. 10 leaves facing and opposite a grape bunch were collected from the central portion of each vine, immediately frozen with liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 \u00b0C. A similar set of samples was kept at normal temperature and dried in an oven at 85 \u00b0C to a constant weight for water content determination. Once the water content was known, samples from 6 vines (representing independent biological replicates with similar water contents ca., 65%) were selected for global metabolomic analyses. Prior to these analyses, samples were freeze-dried and pulverized using a blender (Electrodomesticos Taurus, Aromatic Ver-II, Barcelona, Spain).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Goufo P, Cortez I.

The protocol describes an extraction step that yields an extract that is divided into 5 fractions for separation by chromatography. In the extraction step, 20 mg sample was added with 400 \u00b5l methanol. The components were mixed thoroughly by homogenizing (GenoGrinder 2000, Glen Mills Inc, Clifton, NJ, US) for 2 min at room temperature to precipitate protein and dissociate small molecules bound to protein or trapped in the precipitated protein matrix. Following centrifugation (Pro Analytical CR400R, Centurion Scientific Ltd, Chichester, UK) at 1,500 x g for 5 min (25 \u00b0C), the top organic phase was collected and divided into 5 fractions. The fractions were transferred to a speed vacuum concentrator Turbovap (Zymark Corporation, Hopkinton, MA, US) to remove the organic solvent and the resulting residues frozen at -80 \u00b0C.

The MS interface capillary was maintained at 350 \u00b0C and the corona discharge current was set at 5 \u03bcA. The spray voltages for the positive and negative ion injections were 4.50 and 3.75 kV, respectively. Nebulization was with nitrogen, with a sheath gas flow of 40 (arbitrary units) and an auxiliary gas flow of 5 (arbitrary units) for both positive and negative injections. The nebulizer temperature was set at 400 \u00b0C. </p><p><br></p><p>The mass spectra were recorded alternately between full-scan (MS) and all-ion fragmentation-scan (MSn) modes, and over the period between 1 and 15 min within UPLC gradients. The scan range varied slightly depending on the fraction analyzed, but covers approx. 70-1000 m/z. The resolution for all scans was set at 35,000 (measured at 200 m/z) and at approx. 9 scans/s, which restricted the loading time to 100 ms. MS/MS normalized collision energy was set to 40, activation Q 0.25, and activation time 30 ms, with a 3 m/z isolation window. MS/MS scans were collected using dynamic exclusion with an exclusion time of 3.5 s. The system was calibrated internally as needed to maintain a mass error &lt; 5 ppm for all internal standards (IS) monitored.</p><p><br></p><p>Before extraction, each powdered sample was added with a cocktail (15 \u03bcl of 100 \u03bcg/ml) of 6 recovery standards in methanol (d6-abscisic acid, DL-2-fluorophenylglycine, methyl-d3 stearic acid, tridecanoic acid, 4-chlorophenylalanine and d7-\u03b2-sitosterol or d6-cholesterol), which permitted the monitoring of extraction efficiency. The percent recovery was \u2265 95% for each standard. </p><p><br></p><p>All reconstituted fractions were spiked with a series of isotopically labeled IS at fixed concentrations before injection into the MS, to ensure injection and chromatographic consistency. The following ISs were used to assess instrument performance and to serve as retention time (RT) markers for chromatographic alignment: d7-glucose, d3-methionine, d3-leucine, d8-phenylalanine, d5-tryptophan, Cl-phenylalanine, Br-phenylalanine, d15-octanoic acid, d19-decanoic acid, d27-tetradecanoic acid, d35-octadecanoic acid.</p><p><br></p><p>Technical replicate samples generated by combining a small portion of each of the 24 experimental samples were also analyzed. Water blanks and solvent blanks were used to provide a baseline reference signal and segregate external contamination sources, respectively. Experimental samples were randomized across the platform run, with technical replicates and blanks spaced evenly among the injections. </p><p><br></p><p>Instrument variability was determined by calculating the median relative standard deviation (RSD) for the ISs. Overall process coefficient of variation was determined by calculating the median RSD for all endogenous lipids present in technical replicate samples. Median RSD for instrument and process variability were 7% and 8% (&lt; 10%) respectively, indicating that all aspects of the analysis process were operating within specifications.</p>",

The <strong>LIMS</strong> is built on a web-service platform utilizing <strong>Microsoft's .NET technologies</strong>, which run on high-performance application servers and fiber-channel storage arrays in clusters to provide active failover and load-balancing. Using retention indexes (RI), <strong>LIMS</strong> was first used to perform a RT correction of the output matrix based on RT markers placed throughout the chromatographic time window. Then, the resulting MS/MS data were searched against the <strong>LIMS</strong> library of purified standards and routinely detected unknown entities by comparing their specific m/z, fragment ion spectra, and RIs within user-given ranges. The <strong>LIMS</strong> chemical library is generated from ca., 10,000 MS/MS spectra of more than 4500 authenticated standard compounds, including their associated adducts, in-source fragments, and multimers.</p><p><br></p><p>Compound identifications were based on three criteria: <strong>(i)</strong> RI within a narrow window of the proposed identification, typically 75 RI units of the proposed identification or approximately 5 s, <strong>(ii)</strong> accurate mass match to the library of +/- 10 ppm, <strong>(iii)</strong> MS/MS forward and reverse scores above 80%. Identifications were automatically approved if all the above criteria were met<strong>[1]</strong>. Only one method <strong>(LC/MS Pos Early, LC/MS Pos Late, LC/MS Neg, LC/MS Polar, or GC/MS)</strong> was chosen to represent compounds redundantly detected during the injections. When isomers belonging to the same isobaric species were found they were denoted by adding a number within brackets after the isobaric species name.</p><p><br></p><p>Hundreds of molecular species were successfully detected in all samples. Compounds that were detected in at least 33% of all replicates for the same test group were included in subsequent analyses. Peaks were quantified as area-under-the-curve detector ion counts and normalized to the sample weight. The raw area count for each compound was rescaled through the division of each sample value by the median value for this specific compound to obtain the scaled imputed data.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Statistical analysis:</strong></p><p>Statistical analyses consisted of a series of pairwise comparisons among experimental groups <strong>(CTL, ASY, SY1, SY2)</strong> using the Excel add-in application \u201c<strong>Statistical Analysis Tool</strong>\u201d (<a href='http://prime.psc.riken.jp/compms/others/main.html Statistics' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>http://prime.psc.riken.jp/compms/others/main.html Statistics</a>). Following imputation of missing values with the minimum observed value for each compound, fold changes were calculated as <strong>log2</strong> ratio of the scaled imputed mean of an experimental group and that of another experimental group. <strong>Welch\u2019s 2-sample t-tests</strong> were used to compare the means of the different leaf groups. Before these analyses, scaled imputed data were <strong>log10</strong>-transformed to normalize distributions. A <strong>P-value</strong> correction was performed by estimating the false discovery rate, which was obtained by the <strong>q-value</strong>, thereby accounting for multiple comparisons. For a better visualization of the data, box-and-whisker plots of means were constructed for each molecular species.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Evans AM, DeHaven CD, Barrett T, Mitchell M, Milgram E.
