                "description": "<p>Mycoplasma synovise (MS) is a prominent pathogen of poultry, causing considerable economic pressure to the poultry industry. Although we have a basic understanding of MS infection, the research on the pathogenicity and interactions between host and MS especially the metabolic bases of MS infection are still unclear. In this study, untargeted metabolomics analyses were conducted on plasma of SPF chickens infected with different virulence MS strains ZX313 and SD2. A total of 801 and 834 significant different metabolites (SDMs) were observed in ZX313 and SD2 infected samples respectively, among which 195 and 228 metabolites were group specific. Metabolic pathway enrichment analysis showed that MS infection disrupted amino acid metabolism, nucleotide metabolism and lipid metabolism of host. Moreover, tryptophan metabolites and fatty acid metabolites, differentially expressed in different virulence group, may related to the severity of the disease and the pathogenicity of MS. These findings may offer new insights into pathogenesis of MS and host-MS interaction.</p>",

The mobile phases for positive ion mode were water with 0.1% formic acid (A) and methanol with 0.1% formic acid (B); for negative ion mode, water with 10 mM ammonium formate (A) and 95% methanol with 10 mM ammonium formate (B). The gradient elution was as follows: 0.0-1.0 min, 2% B; 1.0-9.0 min, 2-98% B; 9.0-12.0 min, 98% B; 12.0-12.1 min, 98-2% B; 12.1-15.0 min, 2% B. The flow rate was 0.35 mL/min, the column temperature was 45 \u00b0C and the injection volume was 5 \u03bcL.</p>",
