                "description": "Rosuvastatin is a quite known lipid-lowering agent generally used for hypercholesterolemia treatment and coronary artery diseases prevention. There is substantial inter-individual variability in the absorption of statins usually caused by genetic polymorphisms leading to variation in the corresponding pharmacokinetic parameters, which may affect drug therapy safety and efficacy. Therefore, the investigation of metabolic markers associated with rosuvastatin inter-individual variability is exceedingly relevant for drug therapy optimization and minimizing side effects. This work describes the application of pharmacometabolomics strategies using liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry to investigate endogenous plasma metabolites capable of predicting pharmacokinetic parameters in predose samples. First, a targeted method for the determination of plasma concentration levels of rosuvastatin was validated and applied to obtain the pharmacokinetic parameters from the 40 enrolled individuals, then predose samples were analyzed using the metabolomics approach to search for associations between endogenous metabolites and the corresponding pharmacokinetic parameters. Data processing using machine learning revealed some candidates including sterols and bile acids, carboxylated metabolites as well as lipids suggesting the approach herein described as promising for personalized drug therapy.",

This algorithm was applied as an estimator for AUC and Cmax predictions using Python 3.7.10 with scikit-learn<strong>[1]</strong> version 0.22.2. Other Python programming standard packages for data manipulation such as Pandas<strong>[2]</strong> and Numpy<strong>[3]</strong>, and data visualization such as Matplotlib<strong>[4]</strong>, Seaborn<strong>[5]</strong> and ScyPy<strong>[6]</strong> were also employed.</p><p><br></p><p>Results were mainly assessed in terms of explained variance R2 (sklearn.metrics.explained_variance_score), main absolute percentage error MAPE (sklearn.metrics.mean_absolute_percentage_error) and root mean squared error (sklearn.metrics.mean_squared_error, squared=False). For overfitting checking and model validation the same metrics were employed obtained by Leave-One-Out (LOOCv) cross-validation predicted data for each validation sample (sklearn.model_selection.cross_val_predict, cv=LeaveOneOut()). Models were refined based on the selection of features with non-zero coefficients where among all initially selected features different number of features starting from the most significant, and by steps of one each feature ending with all significant features were all evaluated. For each iteration, their corresponding quality metrics were collected for further evaluation. The optimal number of significant features were further used in the process of model hyperparameters tuning (sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV).
