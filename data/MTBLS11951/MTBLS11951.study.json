                "title": "Metabolomic and physiological analysis of bud differentiation in dense apple (Malus \u00d7 domestica Borkh.) orchards following thinning and reshaping",
                "description": "<p>BACKGROUND: In China, a majority of apple orchards were initially planted under arboriculture. Noteworthy, as the trees age, there is an increase in the number of branches and the degree of orchard depression and deterioration of the canopy light conditions. This phenomenon results in in blockage of bud differentiation, causing yield decrease and overall deterioration in fruit quality. Intercropping is an effective strategy for addressing the issue of orchard depression. However, the impact of intercropping on bud differentiation remains unclear. This study thus analyzed the physiological and metabolic aspects of flower bud differentiation after thinning and reshaping an overcrowded orchard. METHODS: A series of physiological and metabolomic analyses were conducted on terminal flower bud samples collected during early (T1) and late (T2) bud differentiation following thinning and reshaping alongside their controls CK1 and CK2. RESULTS: The T1 group had significantly higher amounts of sucrose, glucose, fructose and sorbitol compared to its control. Metabolomic analyses yielded 845 metabolites. Among these metabolites, 72 were significantly different in CK1 vs T1. In contrast, 73 metabolites were different in CK2 vs T2, while 26 metabolites were common between the two comparison groups. CK1 vs T1 and CK2 vs T2 had 20 and 16 enhanced metabolic pathways, respectively. Bud differentiation was closely associated with the phenylpropane and flavonoid biosynthesis pathways. CONCLUSIONS: Thinning and reshaping of the apple orchard improved light penetration and increased the content of coumarins and eriodictyol, thereby promoting flower bud differentiation. This study provides new insights into how orchard management practices, such as thinning, pruning and shaping, promote flower bud development in apple trees.</p>",

The experimental trees were 15-year-old 'Changfu No. 2' Fuji apple trees grafted onto Malus robusta rootstocks. The trees were planted at a spacing of 4 x 3 m, leading to a density of 834 trees per hectare. The trees were trained in an improved spindle shape with heights ranging between 4.2 and 4.6 m, a trunk height from 60 to 75 cm, and from 6 to 9 main branches angled at between 70\u00b0 and 80\u00b0.</p><p><br></p><p>The thinning and reshaping experiment was done in a single-factor randomized. Two treatment groups were established in mid-February 2022 during the early stages of flower bud differentiation: T1 (thinning and reshaping) and CK1 (control, no thinning nor reshaping). Two additional treatment groups were set in mid-August 2022, toward the end of flower bud differentiation: T2 (thinning and reshaping) and CK2 (control, no thinning nor reshaping). Alternate trees were thinned out in the T1 and T2 groups, changing the row and tree spacing to 4 x 6 m. The canopy size was also reduced by pruning the large branches, raising the trunk and removing the tree apex, resulting in tree heights from 3.1 to 3.4 m, trunk heights from 100 to 110 cm, and from 4 to 6 main branches with an angle of between 90\u00b0 and 100\u00b0. Other pruning practices followed the standard methods for Fuji apple trees, with a total pruning volume of approximately 30%. CK1 and CK2 treatments were not thinned nor reshaped.</p><p><br></p><p>Each treatment was replicated thrice, with 5 well-developed trees selected per replicate. Sampling was conducted on August 22, 2022, during the last phase of the physiological development of flower buds. Samples were collected from the terminal flower buds on medium to short shoots located in the mid-lower canopy, ensuring uniformity in flower bud size and fullness. Samples were collected in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80 \u00b0C, awaiting the subsequent assays.</p>",
