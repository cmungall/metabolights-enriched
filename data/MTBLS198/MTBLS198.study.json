                "description": "The present study aims to investigate the dose dependent effects of consuming diets enriched in flavonoid-rich and flavonoid-poor fruits and vegetables on the urine metabolome of adults who had a \u22651.5 fold increased risk of cardiovascular diseases. A single-blind, dose-dependent, parallel randomized controlled dietary intervention was conducted where volunteers (n = 126) were randomly assigned to one of three diets: high flavonoid diet, low flavonoid diet or habitual diet as a control for 18 weeks. High resolution LC\u2013MS untargeted metabolomics with minimal sample cleanup was performed using an Orbitrap mass spectrometer. Putative biomarkers which characterize diets with high and low flavonoid content were selected by state-of-the-art data analysis strategies and identified by HR-MS and HR-MS/MS assays. Discrimination between diets was observed by application of two linear mixed models: one including a diet-time interaction effect and the second containing only a time effect. Valerolactones, phenolic acids and their derivatives were among sixteen biomarkers related to the high flavonoid dietary exposure. Four biomarkers related to the low flavonoid diet belonged to the family of phenolic acids. For the first time abscisic acid glucuronide was reported as a biomarker after a dietary intake, however its origins have to be examined by future hypothesis driven experiments using a more targeted approach. This metabolomic analysis has identified a number of dose dependent urinary biomarkers (i.e. proline betaine or iberin-N-acetyl cysteine), which can be used in future observation and intervention studies to assess flavonoids and non-flavonoid phenolic intakes and compliance to fruit and vegetable intervention.",

Participants attended 4 clinical visits at the Hugh Sinclair Unit of Human Nutrition (week 0, 6, 12 and 18), where measurements of vascular function were performed and fasting blood and 24-h urine samples were collected. A total of 174 participants (68 men, 106 women) commenced the study, with 154 (60 men, 94 women) completing all 4 visits. Samples from 126 volunteers (42 persons per diet) resulting in a total of 504 24-h urine samples on which untargeted metabolomics analysis was performed.\nDetails regarding the diets were as follows: participants in the HF group received F&V which contained >=15 mg/100 g flavonoids.

The composition of mobile phases was: 95% of solvent A and 5% of solvent B were maintained for 1 min, followed by an increase of solvent B to 45% in 12 min and to 80% in 2 min and maintained for 2 min.

                        "description": "The Orbitrap LTQ was equipped with an Electrospray Ionization (ESI) probe and operated in the positive and negative ionization modes. The conditions in ESI positive (and negative) mode were: source voltage 5.0 kV (3.5 kV), heated capillary temperature 320 \u00b0C, capillary voltage 30 V (-30 V) and tube lens 110 V (-110 V). In the LTQ component of the instrument, nitrogen was used as both the sheath gas (70 U) and auxiliary gas (30 U), and helium was used as the damping gas. All measurements were done using the automatic gain control of the LTQ to adjust the number of ions entering the trap. Product ions were generated in the LTQ trap at collision energy 30 eV using an isolation width of 2 Da. Full-scan accurate mass spectra (mass range from 50 to 700 Da) were obtained at a mass resolution of 30,000 FWHM (m/z 400) in profile mode. The mass spectrometer operated under data-dependent-acquisition (DDA) mode during the complete chromatographic run, in which both MS and MSn spectra were acquired simultaneously. The resolving power for MS2 scans was 7500. Mass calibration was performed with every sequence run just prior to starting the batch by using flow injection of the manufacturer\u2019s calibration standards mixture allowing for mass accuracies <5 ppm in external calibration mode. 10 \u00b5l of sample were injected to the system. Additional MS3 and MS4 experiments were performed for selected ions showing statistically significant differences between treatments. Three samples were reinjected for each ion of interest and, samples were chosen based on maximal intensity.",
