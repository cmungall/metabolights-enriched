                "description": "<p>Long-term low-dose ionizing radiation (LLIR) widely exists in human life and has been confirmed to have potential pathogenic effects on cancer and cardiovascular diseases. However, it is technically and ethically unfeasible to explore LLIR-induced phenotypic changes in the human cohort, leading to slow progress in revealing the pathogenesis of LLIR. In this work, we recruited 32 radiation workers and 18 healthy non-radiation workers from the same city with the same eating habits for radiation damage evaluation and metabolomics profiling. It was found that clear metabolic phenotypic differences existed between LLIR and non-LLIR exposed participants. Moreover, LLIR exposed workers can be further divided into 2 types of metabolic phenotypes, corresponding to high and low damage types, respectively. 3-hydroxypropanoate and glycolaldehyde were identified as sensitive indicators to radiation damage, which specific response to the chromosomal aberration of workers and may be potential monitoring markers for LLIR protection. Taurine metabolism-related pathways were identified as the main differential metabolic pathway under LLIR inducing, which had been confirmed to have a response to acute or chronic radiation exposure. We expect our study can be helpful to LLIR damage monitoring and symptomatic intervention in the future.</p>",

The plasma sample was obtained by centrifuging whole blood samples (approximately 3&nbsp;mL) collected from a heparin sodium anticoagulant tube within 30&nbsp;min. Blood cell samples from radiation workers were further used to detect radiation damage related indicators, including chromosome aberration, chromatid aberration and lymphocyte micronucleus, in the central laboratory. Plasma samples from all participants were repackaged in 120&nbsp;\u03bcL volumes, then immediately quenched with liquid nitrogen and transferred to -80 \u00b0C refrigerator for storage until metabolomics experiments usage. A day before sample collecting, all participants were put on a diet.
