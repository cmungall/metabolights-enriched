                "description": "<p>Bivalves serve as an ideal ecological indicator; hence, their use by the NOAA Mussel Watch Program to monitor environmental health. This study aimed to expand the baseline knowledge of using metabolic end points in environmental monitoring by investigating the dreissenid mussel metabolome in the field. Dreissenids were caged at four locations along the Maumee River for 30 days. The mussel metabolome was measured using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and mussel tissue chemical contaminants were analyzed using gas or liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. All Maumee River sites had a distinct mussel metabolome compared to the reference site and revealed changes in the energy metabolism and amino acids. Data also highlighted the importance of considering seasonality or handling effects on the metabolome at the time of sampling. The furthest upstream site presented a specific mussel tissue chemical signature of pesticides (atrazine and metolachlor), while a downstream site, located at Toledo's wastewater treatment plant, was characterized by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and other organic contaminants. Further research into the dreissenid mussel's natural metabolic cycle and metabolic response to specific anthropogenic stressors is necessary before successful implementation of metabolomics in a biomonitoring program. </p>",

                        "description": "<p><strong>Sampling Sites and Collection Procedures</strong></p><p>The study evaluated 4 sites, 3 in the lower Maumee River and a reference site in Lake Erie. The reference site (REFERENCE-LEMR-03; Table S1) was located in Lake Erie, 13 km northeast of the Maumee River mouth at the small artificial island built in 1901 to support the Toledo Lighthouse. Due to the distance from the mouth of the river and the expected lower contamination burden relative to the other sites, this site was designated as a reference as we recognize that there are no truly pristine sites within the study area. The 3 river sites are located within an anthropogenically (agriculture, industrial, urban) impacted ecosystem and are described as follow: RIVER MOUTH-LEMR-0 (river-km 0), located at the river mouth between the dredged shipping channel and the southeast corner of Grassy Island; WWTP OUTFALL-LEMR-01 (river-km 1.9), located at the Toledo WWTP outfall; and UP RIVER-LEMR-04 (river-km 10), located along the eastern riverbank between the Anthony Wayne Bridge (Clayton St) and the Norfolk Southern railroad bridge.</p><p><br></p><p>Divers used stainless-steel scrapers to remove Dreissena sp. (approximately 22 \u00b1 2 mm in length) from their attachment to rocks and sheet piles that protect the island lighthouse (REFERENCE-LEMR-03, May 23, 2016 (T0)). Mussels were then placed in a nylon mesh dive bag, gently shaken underwater to remove debris, and immediately placed in coolers with aerated site water upon surfacing. The mussels (approximately 300-500) were then placed in cages (torpedo minnow trap, Frabill, Plano, Illinois) and deployed the same day as collection on metal moorings approximately 0.5 m above the river/lake bottom at 3 locations along the river and at the reference site (4 sites total). The cages were retrieved 4 weeks later, June 20 to June 22, 2016 (T1), and the mussels were divided into 2 sets for metabolomics and chemistry analysis.</p><p><br></p><p>Mussels collected for the metabolomics analysis (20-24 per site) were collected from REFERENCE-LEMR- 03 at both timepoints to evaluate metabolic change after 30 days and included both in situ and caged mussels for a handling comparison (Table S1). Caged mussels were collected from the river sites at 30 days (Table S1) to assess the ecosystem health. Mussels were rinsed with site water to remove debris, wiped, bagged and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. The mussels were shipped via overnight carrier in a cryogenic dry shipper (about -150 \u00b0C) and stored at -80 \u00b0C upon receipt at the Hollings Marine Laboratory in Charleston, SC, until analysis. Mussels collected for chemical analysis (200-400 per site) were rinsed with site water to remove debris, placed in freezer bags, packed on water ice and shipped to laboratories within 2 days.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Untargeted Metabolomics</strong></p><p>Individual frozen mussel tissues were removed from the shells by gently cracking the shell with a stainless-steel wrench in a liquid nitrogen cryocart (MVE CryoCart, Princeton Cryogenics, Inc.) to maintain frozen sample integrity during processing. Small remaining pieces of shell were gently removed using precleaned surgical scalpels. Ice found in the shell was kept to avoid any loss of tissue. Each individual mussel was then homogenized using a cryogenic ball-mill homogenizer (Cryomill, Retsch Inc.) with either a 25 or 35 mL grinding jar and 15 or 20 mm balls, respectively, for 2 min at 25 Hz. The homogenized tissue was placed in preweighed 2 mL cryovials using the Cryogenic Workstation. The individual experimental mussel samples were lyophilized (Heto Cooling Trap CT 110, ATR, Laurel, MD) in 2 mL cryovials for approximately 15 h, and 10 mg \u00b1 1 mg of dry tissue was aliquoted into bead-beating tubes. The dried samples were stored at -80 \u00b0C before extraction.</p>",

The extraction protocol was derived from a previous study<strong>[2]</strong> and fully described in the Supporting Information in the paper associated with this study. The homogenates were then added to a cold solvent mix (containing cold chloroform (32 mL/g dry mass) (Fisher Scientific) and Millipore water (16 mL/g dry mass)) for a final solvent volume ratio of chloroform:methanol:water (2:2:1.8). The mixture was vortexed for 30 s, and incubated on ice for 10 min. The solvent phases were partitioned by centrifugation at 2000 x g at 4 \u00b0C for 5 min.

For NMR-based metabolomics studies, a 2 mmol sucrose in a 10% D2O sealed standard sample was used as a system suitability test (SST) before the analysis of experimental samples<strong>[3]</strong>. Control materials used to evaluate technical precision included a process blank, an in-house pooled mussel control material (MCM), an NIST standard reference material (SRM 2974a - Organics in freeze-dried mussel tissue) and a technical replicate added to each extraction batch. MCM was prepared using 81 additional mussel samples collected during the study. All individual MCM mussels were removed from the shell, homogenized and lyophilized following the same protocol as for the experimental samples.

Residual water (4.84-4.76 ppm) and experimental contaminants (acetate 1.92 ppm) detected in the blanks were manually removed. Data were then imported to MetaboAnalyst 5.0<strong>[3]</strong> where spectra were normalized to total spectral intensity, and bins were mean-centered and Pareto-scaled before statistical analysis. Differences in the metabolome between sites, timepoints and handling methods were visualized using principal component analysis (PCA). Differences between sites were further investigated by partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA; MetaboAnalyst). Pairwise comparisons between the river sites and the reference site were performed by PLS-DA. The resonances presenting a variable importance in projection (VIP) &gt; 1.5 on the average of 5 components were selected as significant resonances leading to the metabolite identification. Since a database representative of mollusc is not available, identified metabolites that were driving the difference between sites were implemented in the pathway analysis against the zebrafish (Danio rerio) database instead in MetaboAnalyst.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Jacob D, Deborde C, Lefebvre M, Maucourt M, Moing A.
