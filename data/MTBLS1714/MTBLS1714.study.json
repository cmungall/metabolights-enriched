                "description": "Pseudo-nitzschia multistriata is a planktonic diatom species with a diplontic life cycle comprising a short sexual phase during which gametes are produced from the encounter of two diploid cells of opposite mating type (MT). Gene expression studies have highlighted the presence of substantial changes occurring at the onset of sexual reproduction. Collectively, there is clear evidence of a chemical cross talk which mediates the mating step.\nHerein, we have hypothesized that these major transcriptomic changes are associated to variations in the amount and nature of the metabolites produced by the cells. In order to investigate such chemical diversity in an unbiased manner, we undertook an untargeted metabolomics approach. Liquid chromatography \u2013 tandem mass spectrometry was applied to investigate the differences in the metabolic profiles between control cells in the vegetative phase (MT+ and MT-) and mixed strains of opposite MTs (cross) undergoing sexual reproduction. Of the 2408 high-quality features obtained, 70 known metabolites could be identified based on in-house libraries and online databases; molecular networking proved valuable to classify additional 47 non-identified features.\nThe present exploratory study provides an overview of the chemical diversity detectable in P. multistriata, presenting a dynamic picture of the changes occurring during sexual reproduction. In particular, the reduction of phytol detected in the cross can be linked to the general downregulation of photosynthesis during sexual reproduction observed elsewhere. The dysregulation of other metabolites stands as a starting point for the understanding of the mechanisms regulating sexual reproduction: a metabolite that was tentatively identified as 7-dehydrodesmosterol exhibited the highest upregulation in the comparison between the two MTs of opposite sex, as well as between MT+ vs cross.\nThe effects of extraction solvents and harvesting times on the ensemble of endo-metabolites were also analyzed.\n",

Each MT was set up with 14 litres culture starting from a cell concentration of 10,000 cells/ml. When cell density reached a concentration between 140,000 and 160,000 cells/ml, 500 ml of the two cultures were mixed in a glass flask (cross), while 1 l of each monoculture was moved in a separate glass flask to serve as control. Triplicates were prepared for each sample at each time point.</p><p>Samples were collected at 1 h, when cells of the two MTs had detected the presence of the opposite MT and were reacting to the presence of primary pheromones. At 6 h, when cells of opposite MTs are searching for a partner and start the mating process. And at 24 h, when gametes have appeared. At each sampling time, 1 l of each culture (MT+, MT- and Cross), in triplicate, were gently filtrated using Millipore\u00ae Stericup\u2122 (Darmstadt, Germany) filters with 0.22 mm pores, cells were recovered from the filter in a small volume and were then centrifuged at 3220 x g, for 20 mins, at 18 \u00b0C. The pellets were frozen with liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 \u00b0C, and were then lyophilized to obtain dry biomass.&nbsp;</p>",
