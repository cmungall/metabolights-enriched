After 6-h treatment, all cell samples were taken at the same time, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 \u00b0C until required.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Zhao K, Liu HY, Zhou MM, Liu JX.

In both ESI positive and negative modes, the mobile phase contained A = 25 mM ammonium acetate and 25 mM ammonium hydroxide in water and B = acetonitrile. The gradient was 98% B for 1.5 min and was linearly reduced to 2% in 10.5 min, and then kept for 2 min, and then increased to 98% in 0.1 min, with a 3 min re-equilibration period employed. In order to avoid the effects of instrument detection signal fluctuations, continuous analysis of samples was performed randomly. Pooled quality control (QC) samples (generated by taking an equal aliquot of all the samples included in the experiment) were run 3x times before the beginning of the sample queue for column conditioning and every 6 injections thereafter to assess inconsistencies that are particularly evident in large batch acquisitions in terms of retention time drifts and variation in ion intensity over time.</p>",

For peak picking, the following parameters were used: centWave, m/z = 25 ppm, peakwidth = c(10,60), prefilter = c(10,100). For peak grouping, bw = 5, mzwid = 0.025, minfrac = 0.5 were used. In the extracted ion features, only the variables having more than 50% of the nonzero measurement values in at least one group were kept. Compound identification of metabolites was performed by MS/MS spectra with an in-house database established with available authentic standards. After normalized to total peak intensity, the processed data were uploaded into SIMCA-P (version 14.1, Umetrics, Umea, Sweden), where it was subjected to multivariate data analysis, including Pareto-scaled principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA). The 7-fold cross-validation and response permutation testing were used to evaluate the robustness of the model. The variable importance in the projection (VIP) value of each variable in the OPLS-DA model was calculated to indicate its contribution to the classification. Significance was determined using an unpaired Student\u2019s t test. VIP value &gt; 1 and p-value &lt; 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Kessner D, Chambers M, Burke R, Agus D, Mallick P.

The in-house database has &gt;30,000 substances, which contains 6000+ metabolites (4000+ from human/animals and 2000+ from plants) identified by reference materials. Another 24,000+ metabolites were from 4 public databases: MassBank, Metlin, HMDB and the secondary standard spectrum library which corresponds to MoNA. The identification level of the in-house database is level 2 and above. The MS/MS spectra matching score was calculated using dot-product algorithm, which take the fragments and intensities into consideration. The matching score cutoff was set as 0.8, and the MS/MS spectra matching results were confirmed with standards.</p>",
