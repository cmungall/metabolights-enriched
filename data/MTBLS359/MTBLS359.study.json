                "description": "Background: Salmonella Typhimurium is a gram-negative enteropathogen that infects millions worldwide; the rapid emergence of antibiotic resistant strains has heightened the urgency of developing effective treatment for this pathogen. Previous studies have demonstrated that the aqueous extract of yerba mate (Ilex paraguariensis) provides effective therapy, in vitro, for the drug-resistant S. Typhimurium DT104. Unfortunately, while some of the chemical constituents that contribute to the extract\u2019s antibacterial activity have been identified, the mechanism of action of the extract is still unknown and of crucial importance to its future potential in combating antibiotic resistant bacteria.</br> Results: Yerba mate extract altered central carbon metabolism in S. Typhimurium, reduced catalase activity by means other than direct inhibition, and did not change membrane integrity (except at the initial 0 time point, where differences were not resolved) despite a significant increase in the production of a cell wall precursor. Additional significant differences were observed in the global metabolic regulators alpha-ketoglutarate and acetylphosphate, the energy-related molecule NAD+, and in an unexpected match to the antibacterial compound yohimbine.</br> Conclusions: This work provides the first insight into the mechanism of action of yerba mate extract on S. Typhimurium by revealing a major impact on central carbon metabolism, catalase activity, and possible metabolic links to interference in energy production and membrane integrity. The putative identification of the antibacterial compound yohimbine and the many unidentified compounds provides additional avenues for future investigations of novel yerba mate compounds capable of traversing or binding to S. Typhimurium\u2019s membrane.",

All growth experiments were performed in 125 ml flasks containing 12.5 ml TSB, 10 ml reconstituted yerba mate extract or MOPS buffer pH 7.3, and 2.5 ml S.

Parameters for peak selection were: mass domain resolution of 5 ppm, time domain resolution of 10 scans, EIC smoothing of 3 scans, peak grouping of 0.5 min, drop 80% intensities to get baseline, baseline smoothing of 10 scans, 3 minimum good peaks, minimum signal/baseline ration of 5, minumum peak width of 10 scans, minimum signal/blank ration of 5, and minimum peak intensity of 10000 ions. Peak intensity data in the resulting data matrix was normalized to biomass by scaling the intensity for each sample. All samples were arbitrarily scaled to the intensity value of the first sample (7.35 \u00d7 108 CFU/ml counts). To investigate treatment and time differences, the data matrix was analyzed as a randomized block design, blocked on replicate, with split plots of time. A split plot analysis was considered sufficient when the change in Akaike information criterion (AIC) was less than 3 between a repeated measures model with an adjusted correlation structure (AR1) and a split plot model without a defined correlation structure. In 131 of the 7693 untargeted metabolites that were normal and had equal variance, the change in AIC was greater than 3, so a repeated measures correlation structure was used in those cases. The 3 flask treatments were control_no_tea (0 mg/ml yerba mate extract with S. Typhimurium), tea (80 mg/ml yerba mate extract with S. Typhimurium), and control_no_bacteria (80 mg/ml yerba mate extract with PBS instead of bacteria). ANOVA assumptions were tested in R with the Levene test for equal variance (P>0.05) and the Shapiro-Wilks test for normality (W>0.80). If these assumptions were not met or if errors occurred in the lme analysis (i.e. \u201ccomputationally singular matrix\u201d), metabolites were not included in the analysis. Otherwise, data were analyzed using linear mixed models (package nlme, R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). P-values were collected from a Tukey\u2019s honestly significant differences (HSD) analysis implemented with the R glht function from the multcomp package. Tukey HSD p-values were adjusted for multiple comparisons with the Benjamini-Hochberg method (false discovery rate 0.05, R function p.adjust) as a single family across all metabolites. ANOVA p-values across treatments were adjusted with the Benjamini-Hochberg correction as a separate group across all metabolites. Metabolites with an ANOVA p-value of P< 0.05 across all treatments that additionally had a Tukey HSD contrast p-value of P<0.05 were ranked by the most positive to most negative fold-change in the results tables.",
