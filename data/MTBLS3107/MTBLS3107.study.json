                "description": "<p>SARS-CoV-2 infection causes severe pulmonary manifestations, with poorly understood mechanisms and limited treatment options. Hyperferritinemia and disrupted lung iron homeostasis in COVID-19 patients imply that ferroptosis, an iron-dependent cell death, may occur. Immunostaining and lipidomic analysis in COVID-19 lung autopsies reveal increases in ferroptosis markers, including transferrin receptor 1 and malondialdehyde accumulation in fatal cases. COVID-19 lungs display dysregulation of lipids involved in metabolism and ferroptosis. We find increased ferritin light chain associated with severe COVID-19 lung pathology. Iron overload promotes ferroptosis in both primary cells and cancerous lung epithelial cells. In addition, ferroptosis markers strongly correlate with lung injury severity in a COVID-19 lung disease model using male Syrian hamsters. These results reveal a role for ferroptosis in COVID-19 pulmonary disease; pharmacological ferroptosis inhibition may serve as an adjuvant therapy to prevent lung damage during SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>",

All human samples were obtained from the Columbia University tissue bank. Severe COVID-19 lung autopsies with ALI and non-ALI pathology were collected from patients deceased from respiratory failure caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Severe lung explants were collected from patients with severe COVID-19 disease. Mild COVID-19 lung explants/biopsies were selected from patients recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Control lungs were selected from resections of pneumothorax lungs and neoplastic lungs that had no lung injury and were not infected with SARS-CoV-2. Non-COVID-19 control lung autopsies with ALI were collected from patients deceased from respiratory failure before the pandemic. Both male and female patients were equally involved. The sex and age of all subjects involved are provided in <strong>Data S1</strong> in the paper associated with this study. Consents were obtained for all patient samples obtained from the Columbia University tissue bank. The initial and last laboratory ferritin test records were obtained from severe COVID-19 patients involved in this study. Patient serum was collected during routine blood test and an immunoassay against ferritin was performed on the Roche analyzer in the Automated Lab.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Tissue pathology examination:</strong></p><p>Lung tissue block smaller than 4 mm x 4 mm x 4 mm were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for over 24 h.

FFPE tissue sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) and scanned using Leica AT2 whole slide digital imaging at 40x. The scanned whole slide images were annotated for injury and image border using QuPath (v0.4.3). Percentage injured area was calculated by dividing the sum of injured areas by total area and multiplying by 100%. For kidney and heart tissue evaluation, a practicing renal/cardiovascular pathologist blind to the animals' conditions/treatments performed light microscopic evaluated of H&amp;E FFPE tissue from the sampled kidneys and hearts. </p><p><br></p>",

OCT-embedded blocks were then sectioned at 10 mm thickness and washed 5 times with PBS as described previously to remove OCT<strong>[1]</strong>. Briefly, 3 ml of ice-cold PBS was added to each vial containing 20 tissue sections, vortex-mixed, and centrifuged at 2000 x g at 4 \u00b0C for 10 min. Following centrifugation, the supernatant was aspirated carefully to avoid taking up any tissue. This cycle of washing the tissues with cold PBS combined centrifugation was repeated 4 times. The lung sections were then incubated in methanol/acetonitrile (1:1; v/v) at -80 \u00b0C for 24 h to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 virus<strong>[2]</strong>. Viral deactivation solvents were discarded. Lipids were extracted using a modified Folch extraction method enabling a multi-omics analysis<strong>[3</strong>]. Briefly, the tissues were homogenized in 300 ml of methanol containing 0.01% BHT and a mixture of lipid standards using a micro-tip sonicator. Then 600 ml of dichloromethane was added to homogenized samples, and vortex-mixed for 30 s followed by incubating on dry ice on a shaker for 2 h. Next, 180 ml of ice-cold water was added to each sample, vortex-mixed, and incubated for 30 min on ice before centrifugation at 3500 rpm for 20 min at 4 \u00b0C. The total lipid extract was transferred into a glass vial followed by drying under a gentle stream of nitrogen gas. The dried samples were reconstituted in a solution of IPA/ACN/water (4:3:1; v/v/v) before lipidomics analysis. The protein pellet was removed to quantify proteins using the BCA assay. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Rohrbach TD, Boyd AE, Grizzard PJ, Spiegel S, Allegood J, Lima S.

In brief, samples were analyzed using Acquity UPLC I-class PLUS interfaced with a Synapt G2-Si Mass spectrometer (Waters Corp.). Chromatographic separation was performed with a 20 min gradient elution profile on a Waters Acquity CSH C18 column (1.7 m, 2.1 mm x 100 mm). Both positive and negative electrospray ionization (ESI) modes used the same mobile phase: (A) water:ACN (40:60; v/v) and (B) water:ACN:IPA (5:10:85; v/v/v). However, different mobile phase modifiers were used in order to improve the lipid coverage<strong>[4]</strong>. For the positive mode, 10 mM ammonium formate and 0.1% formic acid were used, while 10 mM ammonium acetate was used for the negative ESI mode. The following linear gradient at 400 \u00b5l/min flow rate with a column temperature at 55 \u00b0C was used: 0.0-2.0 min: 60% B, 2.0-2.3 min: 75% B, 2.3-10 min: 90% B, 10-17 min: 100% B, 17-20 min: 40% B. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Kraft VAN, Bezjian CT, Pfeiffer S, Ringelstetter L, M\u00fcller C, Zandkarimi F, Merl-Pham J, Bao X, Anastasov N, K\u00f6ssl J, Brandner S, Daniels JD, Schmitt-Kopplin P, Hauck SM, Stockwell BR, Hadian K, Schick JA.

Source voltages were set to \u00b1 2.5 kV, 30 V, and 5 V for capillary, sampling, and extraction cones, respectively. Moreover, the temperature was set to 120 \u00b0C for the source and 500 \u00b0C for sample desolvation. Gas flow rates were set at 900 L/h and 50 L/h for the desolvation gas and cone gas, respectively. Fragment ion spectra were generated using enhanced data-independent ion mobility (HDMSE) acquisition mode where data from mobility separation ions are collected in 2 channels with either low collision energy applied at 4 V or with an elevated collision energy ramp from 25 to 60 V for precursor and fragment ions, respectively. Nitrogen as the drift gas was held at a flow rate of 90 ml/min in the IMS cell with a wave velocity of 600 m/s and a wave height of 40 V.</p>",
