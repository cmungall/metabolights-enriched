                "description": "<p>Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) refers to nervous system damage caused by perinatal hypoxia, which is the major cause of long-term neuro-developmental disorders in surviving infants. However, the mechanisms still require further investigation. In this study, we found that the butanoate metabolism pathway exhibited significantly decreased and short chain fatty acid (SCFAs)-producing bacteria, especially butyrate-producing bacteria, were significantly decreased in fecal of neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain damage (HIBD) rats. Surprisingly, Sodium butyrate (SB) treatment could ameliorate pathological damage both in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus and facilitate recovery of SCFAs-producing bacteria related to metabolic pathways in neonatal HIBD rats. Moreover, we found that in samples from SB treatment neonatal HIBD rats cortex with high levels of butyrate acid along with aberrant key crotonyl-CoA-producing enzymes ACADS levels was observed compared HIBD rats. We also demonstrated that a decrease in histone 3-lysine 9-crotonylation (H3K9cr) downregulated expression of the HIE-related neurotrophic genes Bdnf, Gdnf, Cdnf and Manf in HIBD rats. Furthermore, SB restored H3K9cr binding to HIE-related neurotrophic genes. Collectively, our results indicate that SB contributes to ameliorate pathological of HIBD by altering gut microbiota and brain SCFAs levels subsequently affecting histone crotonylation-mediated neurotrophic-related genes expression. This may be a novel microbiological approach for preventing and treating HIE.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Untargeted fecal metabolomics</strong>&nbsp;is reported in the current study&nbsp;<a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS4932' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS4932</strong></a>.</p><p><strong>Targeted SCFA brain metabolomics</strong> is reported in <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS4933' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS4933</strong></a>.</p>",

Metabolites were annotated through <strong>LUG</strong> database (Untarget database of GC-MS from Lumingbio).

The Hotelling\u2019s T2 region, shown as an ellipse in score plots of the models, defines the 95% confidence interval of the modeled variation. Variable importance in the projection (VIP) ranks the overall contribution of each variable to the OPLS-DA model, and those variables with VIP &gt; 1 are considered relevant for group discrimination. In this study, the default 7-round cross-validation was applied with 1/7 of the samples being excluded from the mathematical model in each round, in order to guard against overfitting. The differential metabolites were selected on the basis of the combination of a statistically significant threshold of variable influence on projection (VIP) values obtained from the OPLS-DA model and p-values from a two-tailed Student\u2019s t-test on the normalized peak areas from different groups, where metabolites with VIP values larger than 1.0 and p-values less than 0.05 were considered as differential metabolites.</p>",
