                "description": "Excessive renal fibrosis is a common pathology in progressive chronic kidney diseases. Inflammatory injury and aberrant repair processes contribute to the development of kidney fibrosis. Myeloid cells, particularly monocytes/macrophages, play a crucial role in kidney fibrosis by releasing their proinflammatory cytokines and extracellular matrix components such as collagen and fibronectin into the microenvironment of the injured kidney. Numerous signaling pathways have been identified in relation to these activities. However, the involvement of metabolic pathways in myeloid cell functions during the development of renal fibrosis remains understudied. In our study, we initially reanalyzed single-cell RNA sequencing data of renal myeloid cells from Dr. Denby\u2019s group and observed an increased glycolytic pathway in myeloid cells that are critical for renal inflammation and fibrosis. To investigate the role of myeloid glycolysis in renal fibrosis, we utilized a model of unilateral ureteral obstruction in mice deficient of Pfkfb3, an activator of glycolysis, in myeloid cells (Pfkfb3\u0394M\u03d5) and their wild type littermates (Pfkfb3WT). We observed a significant reduction in fibrosis in the obstructive kidneys of Pfkfb3\u0394M\u03d5 mice compared to Pfkfb3WT mice. This was accompanied by a substantial decrease in myeloid cell infiltration, as well as a decrease in the numbers of M1 and M2 macrophages and suppression of macrophage to obtain myofibroblast phenotype in the obstructive kidneys of Pfkfb3\u0394M\u03d5 mice. Mechanistic studies indicate that glycolytic metabolites stabilize HIF1\u03b1, leading to alterations in macrophage phenotypes that contribute to renal fibrosis. In conclusion, our study implicates that targeting myeloid glycolysis represents a novel approach to inhibit renal fibrosis.",

The protocol (Animal protocol 2011-0401 and 2018-0971) followed was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Augusta University. Prior to, during, and after the experiment, welfare assessments, measurements and interventions were performed. The mice were housed under controlled environmental conditions, including a temperature range of 21-25 \u00b0C, humidity between 40-60%, and a 12-h light/dark cycle. All animals had ad libitum access to food (Teklad global 18% protein rodent diet; 2918-060622M, Envigo, Madison, WI, USA) and water. Floxed Pfkfb3 (Pfkfb3flox/flox) mice were generated by Xenogen Biosciences Corporation (Cranbury, NJ, USA)<strong>[1]</strong>. To achieve cell-specific deficiency of Pfkfb3 in macrophages, Pfkfb3flox/flox mice were crossbred with Lysm-Cre transgenic mice (The Jackson Laboratory, stock no. 004781, Bar Harbor, ME, USA) to generate Pfkfb3flox/flox Lysm-Cre (Pfkfb3\u0394M\u03c6) mice, with Pfkfb3WT/WT Lysm-Cre (Pfkfb3WT) mice used as wild type control.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Culture of bone marrow-derived macrophages</strong></p><p>After euthanizing the mice, femurs and tibias were collected and transected. The bone marrow cells were flushed out from the femurs and tibias. These cells were then passed through a 70 \u03bcm cell strainer and centrifuged at 1000 x g for 3 min to obtain a single-cell suspension. The collected cells were plated onto a 10 cm^2 dish and allowed to incubate for 6-8 h to discard the attached cells. The remaining suspension cells were collected and reseeded into a 6-well plate at a density of 2 x 10^6 cells/mL. Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (SH30027.01, Cytiva, Marlborough, MA, USA) supplemented with 10% FBS (F4135, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), 10 ng/mL MCSF (315-02, PeproTech, Cranbury, NJ, USA) and 1% Antibiotic-Antimycotic (15240062, Thermo Scientific, Grand Island, NY, USA) in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 \u00b0C for 7 days to induce macrophage differentiation as described before<strong>[2]</strong>. After 7 days, the differentiated cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 1% FBS, 1% Antibiotic-Antimycotic, and 10 ng/mL MCSF. Subsequently, the cells were treated with or without 10 ng/mL mouse TGF\u03b21 (7666-MB-005, R&amp;D SYSTEMS, Minneapolis, MN, USA) to induce macrophage differentiation for 5 days.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Metabolomics assay</strong></p><p>Bone marrow cells were collected from wild type (Lysm-CRE) or PFKFB3 deficient (PFKFB3-flox/Lysm-CRE) mice and cultured for 7 days for macrophage differentiation.

The analysis was carried out through selected reaction monitoring (SRM), targeting a comprehensive set of 298 endogenous water-soluble metabolites, enabling a thorough examination of the steady-state characteristics of the samples. Some metabolites were targeted in both positive and negative ion mode for a total of 309 SRM transitions using 8 positive/negative ion polarity switching. ESI voltage was +4950 V in positive ion mode and -4500 V in negative ion mode. The dwell time was 3 ms per SRM transition and the total cycle time was 1.55 s. Approximately 9-12 data points were acquired per detected metabolite.</p>",
