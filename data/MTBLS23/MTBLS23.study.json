                "description": "Macrophages are central players in immune response, manifesting divergent phenotypes to control inflammation and innate immunity through release of cytokines and other signaling factors. Recently, the focus on metabolism has been reemphasized as critical signaling and regulatory pathways of human pathophysiology, ranging from cancer to aging, often converge on metabolic responses. Here, we used genome-scale modeling and multi-omics (transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) analysis to assess metabolic features that are critical for macrophage activation. A genome-scale metabolic network for the RAW 264.7 cell line was constructed to determine metabolic modulators of activation. Metabolites well-known to be associated with immunoactivation (glucose and arginine) and immunosuppression (tryptophan and vitamin D3) were among the most critical effectors. Intracellular metabolic mechanisms were assessed, identifying a suppressive role for de-novo nucleotide synthesis. Finally, underlying metabolic mechanisms of macrophage activation were identified by analyzing multi-omic data obtained from LPS-stimulated RAW cells in the context of our flux-based predictions. This study demonstrates that the role of metabolism in regulating activation may be greater than previously anticipated and elucidates underlying connections between activation and metabolic effectors. This submission corresponds to the metabolomics data from this study.",

Each initial match to the library was manually inspected to confirm a confident identification. The data were also matched against the NIST 08 library to identify additional peaks not included in the Fiehn library. MetaboliteDetector software was used for database matching and batch identification/quantification parameters are as follows: required score, 0.6; \u0394RI, 25; minimum S/N, 20; maximum peak discrepancy index, 100. Ions 73 and 143 were excluded from use as metabolite quantification ions, since these are due to fragmentation of the trimethylsilyl groups. Otherwise, three unique fragment ions were assigned to each metabolite for quantification and used for each individual GC-MS analysis when processing the data in batch mode. The summed areas of the three quantification ions were exported from MetaboliteDetector and used in further statistical anayses. All identifications were manually validated by inspection of retention index and spectrum matches.",
