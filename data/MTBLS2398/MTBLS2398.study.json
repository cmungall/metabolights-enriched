                "description": "<p>STW 5, a blend of 9 medicinal plant extracts, exhibits promising efficacy in treating functional gastrointestinal disorders, notably irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Nonetheless, its effects on the gastrointestinal microbiome and the role of microbiota on the conversion of its constituents are still largely unexplored. This study employed an experimental ex vivo model to investigate STW 5's differential effects on fecal microbial communities and metabolite production in samples from individuals with and without IBS. Using 560 fecal microcosms (IBS patients, n=6; healthy controls, n=10), we evaluated the influence of pre-digested STW 5 and controls on microbial and metabolite composition at time points 0, 0.5, 4 and 24 h. Our findings demonstrate the potential of this ex vivo platform to analyze herbal medicine turnover within 4 h with minimal microbiome shifts due to abiotic factors. While only minor taxonomic disparities were noted between IBS- and non-IBS samples and upon treatment with STW 5, rapid metabolic turnover of STW 5 components into specific degradation products, such as 18\u03b2-glycyrrhetinic acid, davidigenin, herniarin, 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid and 3-(2-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl)propanoic acid occurred. For davidigenin, 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid and 18\u03b2-glycyrrhetinic acid, anti-inflammatory, cytoprotective or spasmolytic activities have been previously described. Notably, the microbiome-driven metabolic transformation did not induce a global microbiome shift, and the detected metabolites were minimally linked to specific taxa. Observed biotransformations were independent of IBS diagnosis, suggesting potential benefits for IBS patients from biotransformation products of STW 5.</p>",

The concentration of <strong>STW 5</strong> in the incubation mixture was 0.087 mg of <strong>STW 5 </strong>lyophilizate per ml of 10% HFS. This concentration was based on the daily dosage <strong>of STW 5</strong> (171.3 mg of lyophilizate) and an estimated small intestine fluid volume of approximately 200 mL<strong>[2]</strong>.

RT tolerance for grouping was 0.3 min. The resulting feature table was exported to Microsoft Excel where mean peak areas of the 5 technical replicates were calculated and areas were compared between <strong>STW 5</strong>- and <strong>vehicle</strong>-treated samples. Features with ratios &gt;150% in the <strong>HFS</strong> from at least one of the donors or time points, as well as features with ratios &gt;150% in the <strong>PBS buffer</strong> samples without <strong>HFS</strong> were considered to be related to <strong>STW 5</strong> or its metabolites and kept for further data evaluation. In order to calculate the metabolization ratios of the genuine <strong>STW 5</strong> constituents and the newly formed metabolites at each time point (t0.5 and t4), ratios were set in relation to the c0Met samples (i.e., microbiota-free control samples in which <strong>STW 5</strong> was added after centrifugation and filtration of the fecal suspensions. Significantly different features (p&lt;0.05; peak areas and metabolization ratios: tp0.5/c0Met or tp4/c0Met) were determined using <strong>ALDEx2[2]</strong>. <strong>PBS-buffer</strong> control incubations for pre-digested <strong>STW 5</strong> and its <strong>vehicle</strong> were also prepared for the same time points (tp0.5 or tp4). The respective peak areas of the detected <strong>STW 5</strong> constituents were compared to the peak areas in the vehicle samples to differentiate metabolization processes induced by gut microbiota from those induced by other factors, such as incubation temperature and time<strong>[3]</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p>Due to the low concentration of <strong>STW 5</strong> used in the incubation experiments (0.087 mg/ml), in order to stay in the range of the recommended daily dose of the preparation, and due to the interference of highly abundant matrix constituents derived from ex vivo pre-digestion and from the fecal samples, only the major <strong>STW 5</strong> constituents were detectable in c0Met samples and therefore annotated. Annotation of <strong>STW 5 </strong>constituents and metabolites was either performed by comparison with authentic references or based on reference data in the literature.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Thumann, T.A., Pferschy-Wenzig, E.M., Aziz-Kalbhenn, H., Ammar, R.M., Rabini, S., Moissl-Eichinger, C., Bauer, R., 2020.
