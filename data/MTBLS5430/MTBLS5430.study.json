                "description": "<p>Longitudinal metabolomics and lipidomics analysis was carried out in the blood plasma of mice injected intramuscularly with venoms of the viperid species <em>Bothrops asper</em> and <em>Daboia russelii</em>. Blood samples were collected 1, 3, 6 and 24 h after venom injection, and a control group of non-envenomed mice was included. Significant perturbations in metabolomics and lipidomics were observed at 1, 3 and 6 h, while values returned close to those of control mice by 24 h, hence reflecting a transient pattern of metabolic disturbance. Both venoms induced significant changes in amino acids, as well as in several purines and pyrimidines, and in some metabolites of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. KEGG analysis identified metabolic pathways that showed the highest changes, i.e., aminoacyl tRNA synthesis and amino acid biosynthesis and metabolism pathways. Regarding lipid metabolism, there was an increase of triglycerides and some acyl carnitines, concomitantly with a drop in the levels of some phospholipids. In addition, envenomed mice had higher levels of cortisol, heme and some oxidative stress markers. The overall pattern of metabolic changes in envenomed mice bears similarities with the patterns described in several traumatic injuries, thus underscoring a metabolic response/adaptation to the injurious action of the venoms.</p>",

Samples acquired using full scan MS1 used for quantification and DDA mode were used for spectral identification of the metabolites.&nbsp;The MS1 tolerance was set to 0.01 Da and the MS2 set to 0.025 Da.&nbsp;For peak picking mass slice width was set to 0.1. For peak alignment, the maximum retention time tolerance was set at 0.2 min, MS1 tolerance was set to 0.015. Peaks were identified by searching the MS2 spectra in <strong>MS-DIAL</strong> public database (290,915 records for positive and 36,848 entries for negative, Aug 14, 2020) using a mass tolerance of 0.01 Da for MS1 and 0.05 Da for MS/MS with identification score cutoff of 70.&nbsp;Additionally, peaks were also searched against in-house IORA library (in both positive and negative mode) with a mass tolerance of 0.01 and identification cutoff of 90%.</p><p><br></p><p>Data from <strong>MS-DIAL</strong> was exported out as <strong>txt</strong> file and further processing was done using <strong>R</strong>. The first blank injection signal subtraction and features that have RSD &gt; 30% in the QC sample were discarded. Further, data from both negative and positive polarity were combined, and again examined for duplicates and subsequently cleaned. The final data matrix thus obtained contains 63 negative mode metabolite and 317 positive mode metabolites. All metabolite identifications met MSI Level 1 and 2 requirements<strong>[4]</strong>. Raw peak intensities were analyzed in <strong>R</strong> version 4.2.0.&nbsp;Metabolite peak intensities were first median normalized and autoscaled.&nbsp;For multivariate analysis, the <strong>R</strong> package <strong>mixOmics[5]</strong> was used to analyze venom-induced changes over time.&nbsp;For the discovery of dysregulated metabolites, linear model with covariate adjustment analysis was performed based on the <strong>R</strong> package <strong>limma[6]</strong>. Changes in metabolites that have adjusted p-value \u2264 0.05 were deemed significant. Metabolite enrichment analysis was conducted in <strong>MetaboAnalyst</strong> v5.0 using <strong>KEGG</strong> pathways overrepresentation analysis (ORA; hypergeometric test).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Lipidomics</strong></p><p>Raw data were searched in <strong>LipidSearch</strong> software v4.1 for lipid identification. Search type was set to Product Search.&nbsp;Both precursor and product tolerance were set to 5 ppm with a relative intensity cut-off of 1%. For adducts, neg mode adduct set as M-H and M+HCOO while for positive mode adduct was set as M+H and M+NH4. Peak integration was performed by baseline subtraction, peak smoothing and deconvolution. Finally, peaks were aligned using alignment module with a RT tolerance of 0.25 min. For calculating group peak area max integration algorithm was used.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1] </strong>Tsugawa H, Cajka T, Kind T, Ma Y, Higgins B, Ikeda K, Kanazawa M, VanderGheynst J, Fiehn O, Arita M.
