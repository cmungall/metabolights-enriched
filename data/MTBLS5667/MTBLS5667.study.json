                "description": "<p><strong>OBJECTIVE:</strong> To observe the clinical efficacy and safety of Yiqi Yangxue formula (YQYXF) on knee osteoarthritis (KOA), and to explore the underlying therapeutic mechanism of YQYXF through endogenous differential metabolites and their related metabolic pathways.</p><p><strong>METHODS:</strong> A total of 61 KOA patients were recruited and divided into the treatment group (YQYXF, 30 cases) and the control group (celecoxib, Cxb, 31 cases). Effects of these two drugs on joint pain, swelling, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and c-reactive protein (CRP) were observed, and their safety and adverse reactions were investigated. In animal experiments, 63 SD rats were randomly divided into normal control (NC) group, sham operation (sham) group, model (KOA) group, Cxb group, as well as low-dose (YL), medium-dose (YM), and high-dose groups of YQYXF (YH). The KOA rat model was established using a modified Hulth method. Ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography/Q Exactive HF-X Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap Mass (UHPLC-QE-MS)-based metabolomics technology was used to analyze the changes of metabolites in plasma samples of rats. Comprehensive (VIP) &gt; 1 and t-test p &lt; 0.05 conditions were used to screen the disease biomarkers of KOA, and the underlying mechanisms of YQYXF were explored through metabolic pathway enrichment analysis. The related markers of YQYXF were further verified by ELISA (enzyme\u0002-linked immunosorbent assay).</p><p><strong>RESULTS:</strong> YQYXF can improve joint pain, swelling, range of motion, joint function, Michel Lequesen index of severity for osteoarthritis (ISOA) score, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) score, ESR, and CRP. No apparent adverse reactions were reported. In addition, YQYXF can improve cartilage damage in KOA rats, reverse the abnormal changes of 16 different metabolites, and exert an anti-KOA effect mainly through five metabolic pathways. The levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and glutathione (GSH) were significantly decreased after the treatment of YQYXF.</p><p><strong>CONCLUSION:</strong> YQYXF can significantly improve the clinical symptoms of KOA patients without obvious adverse reactions. It mainly improved KOA through modulating lipid metabolism-related biomarkers, reducing lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress.</p>",

The experiments were conducted under full authorization from the Ethics Committee of Yunnan University of Chinese Medicine (ethical code no. R-062019065). The rats were randomly divided into 7 groups, including <strong>normal control (NC),</strong> <strong>sham-operated (sham)</strong>, <strong>knee osteoarthritis model (KOA)</strong>, <strong>Cxb</strong> (18 mg/kg), <strong>YQYXF low- (YL)</strong>, <strong>middle- (YM)</strong>, and <strong>high- (YH) </strong>dose groups (18.4, 9.2, and 4.6 g of crude drug/kg, respectively). Each group had 9 rats. The <strong>KOA models</strong> were established by the modified Hulth method<strong>[1]</strong>. The anterior ligament was severed, and the medial meniscus was removed with the tibial joint reduction<strong>[2]</strong>. The knee in the <strong>sham group</strong> was only treated with joint capsule opening and suturing. The operation was conducted in an aseptic environment. After the successful modeling, the <strong>NC group</strong> and the <strong>sham group</strong> were provided with normal drinking water and diet. The rest were given the corresponding drug suspension by gavage once a day for 8 consecutive weeks. The plasma was collected by centrifugation, and the right knee joint was taken. The knee joints were fixed with 10% neutral formaldehyde solution and decalcified with 10% EDTA for 56 d. The tissue was embedded in paraffin and sliced with a thickness of 5 \u03bcm.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Rogart JN, Barrach HJ, Chichester CO.

A 95% confidence interval in the <strong>PCA</strong> score plot was used as the threshold to identify potential outliers in the dataset. In order to visualize group separation and find significantly changed metabolites, supervised <strong>orthogonal projections to latent structures-discriminate analysis (OPLS-DA)</strong> were applied. Then, 7-fold cross-validation was performed to examine the quality of the model. Permutation tests were used to test the validity of the model. The first principal component of <strong>variable importance in the projection (VIP)</strong> and <strong>Student\u2019s t-test</strong> were obtained to refine the analysis. Suppose <strong>VIP &gt; 1</strong> and <strong>p &lt; 0.05</strong>, the variable was defined as a significantly different metabolite between the 2 groups. The significantly different metabolites were used for plotting hierarchical clustering based on the Euclidean distance formula and drawn heat maps using the <strong>Pheatmap package</strong> in <strong>R</strong> studio.
