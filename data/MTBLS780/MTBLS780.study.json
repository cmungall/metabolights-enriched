                "description": "The selection of bioengineering platform strains and engineering strategies to improve the stress resistance of Saccharomyces cerevisiae remains a pressing need in bio-based chemical production. Thus, a systematic effort to exploit the genotypic and phenotypic diversity to boost yeast\u2019s industrial value is still urgently needed. Here, we analyzed 5400 growth curves obtained from 36 S. cerevisiae strains and comprehensively profiled their resistances against 13 industrially relevant stresses. We observed that bioethanol and brewing strains exhibit higher resistance against acidic conditions, however, plant isolates tend to have wider range of resistance, which may be associated with their metabolome and fluxome signatures in TCA cycle and fatty acid metabolism. By deep genomic sequencing we found that industrial strains have more genomic duplications especially affecting transcription factors, presenting disparate evolutionary paths in comparison to the environmental strains which have more InDels, gene deletions and strain-specific genes. Genome-wide association studies coupled with protein-protein interaction networks uncovered novel genetic determinants of stress resistances. These resistance-related engineering targets and strain rankings provide a valuable source for engineering significantly improved industrial platform strains.</br></br> This metabolomic study of 36 yeast strains measured intra- and extracellular metabolome under standard glucose medium, profiled by GS-MS. This is part of a multi-omic study on yeast strain collection.",

Strains were classified into four types: 17 industrial strains (from ethanol production, food and brewing industries), 13 environmental strains (isolated from soil, plant and animals), 4 laboratorial and 2 clinical strains (vaginal isolates). A single colony isolated on YPD agar was used to pre-inoculate 100 ml of minimum mineral (MM) medium (pH 5.5; as described in the media used in measurements of stress conditions) at 30 \u00b0C using shake flasks in a rotary shaker at 170 rpm for 24 h. The cells were collected by centrifugation at 2000 x g (4 \u00b0C) for 5 min and washed twice in phosphate buffered saline (8 g/l NaCl, 0.2 g/l KCl, 1.44 g/l Na2PO4, 0.24 g/l KH2PO4, at pH 7.5). The cell pellets were resuspended in fermentation medium at an initial OD600 of 1. The medium was the same as the MM medium with D-glucose (20 g/l) at pH 5.5. The cells were incubated in a rotary shaker-incubator (170 rpm) at 30 \u00b0C until reached OD600 of 5 for glucose medium and OD600 of 10 for ethanol medium.",

                        "description": "Three shake-flask cultures with ethanol medium (100 ml) were harvested at late exponential growth phase. For intracellular metabolomics analysis, five technical replicates (10 ml) for each culture were rapidly filtered under vacuum (Air Cadet vacuum/pressure station, ThermoFisher), quickly washed with cold saline solution (1-2 \u00b0C) and quenched in 2.5 ml of cold methanol water (50 % v/v) at -30 \u00b0C as described by Smart et al. Three samples (1 ml) of the microbial cultures were filtered (0.2 \u03bcm pore size membrane) to remove the S. cerevisiae cells, and the filtrate was used for the analysis of extracellular metabolites. The sampling procedures for both intracellular and extracellular took less than 30 s per sample. To accommodate the lower OD600 for glucose medium, six shake-flask cultures (100 ml) were harvested at late exponential growth phase and two cultures were rapidly pooled together prior to sampling. For intracellular metabolomics analysis, five technical replicates (20 ml) for each pooled culture were prepared as described for the experiments with ethanol medium.</br></br>\n\nThe intracellular metabolites were extracted from the quenched cell pellets using cold methanol/water and freeze-thaw cycles following the protocol optimized by Smart et al. [1]. In brief, the internal standard 2,3,3,3-d4-alanine was added to each sample (0.3 \u03bcmol/sample) before extraction. The solution was mixed vigorously for one minute, frozen at -80 \u00b0C, and thawed at 4 \u00b0C. After the cycle had been repeated two additional rounds, the samples were centrifuged at -20 \u00b0C for 15 min at 20,800 x g. The supernatant was collected and the remaining cells were resuspended in 2.5 ml of cold methanol water (70% v/v) at -30 \u00b0C. Centrifugation was repeated under the identical conditions and the supernatant collected was pooled with the first collection. The intracellular metabolite extracts and spent culture medium containing extracellular metabolites were lyophilized (BenchTop K manifold freeze dryer, VirTis) before chemical derivatization. The lyophilized samples were derivatized using the methyl chloroformate (MCF) method according to the protocol described by Smart et al. [1]. In summary, the lyophilized samples were resuspended in 200 \u03bcl of sodium hydroxide solution (1 M) and transferred to a silanized glass tube, then mixed with 167 \u00b5l of methanol and 34 \u00b5l of pyridine. The derivatization started by adding 20 \u00b5l of MCF followed by vigorously mixing for 30 s, and then a further 20 \u00b5l of MCF was added followed by vigorously mixing for 30 s. To separate MCF derivatives from the reactive mixture, 400 \u00b5l of chloroform was added and vigorously mixed for 10 s followed by the addition of 400 \u00b5l of sodium bicarbonate solution (50 mM), and mixing for an additional 10 s. The aqueous layer was removed and dehydrated with anhydrous sodium sulfate before samples were transferred to GC-MS vials.</br></br>\nThe biomass content (dry weight) was determined after intracellular metabolite extraction by drying the collected cell debris using a domestic microwave (250 W for 20 min), cooling in a desiccator overnight, followed by weighing of each sample.</br></br>\n\nRef:</br>\n[1] Smart KF, Aggio RB, Van Houtte JR, Villas-B\u00f4as SG.
