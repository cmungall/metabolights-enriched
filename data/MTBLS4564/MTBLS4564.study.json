                "description": "<p>The living and dried specimens in botanical collections play an important role in society for scientific and recreational purposes, offering the opportunity to obtain both macroscopic and molecular information for individual plants, ecosystems, and environmental studies. Untargeted metabolomics is an analytical approach that permits the simultaneous study of multiple small molecules present in an organism, which allows us to statistically compare different conditions of interest. Metabolomic approaches have been used on living specimens in botanical collections, but, until now, not on historical dried material. Using the Nicotiana genus herbaceous plant (tobacco) as a case study, we propose an untargeted metabolomic study to evaluate the potential of dried historical specimens as a source of metabolomic information on the past. The metabolomic profile from polar and less-polar/apolar aqueous extracts of four modern handmade tobacco cigars (split into wrapper, binder, and filler leaves), and a set of eight late-19th to early-20th century tobacco specimens (seven tobacco leaves and one snuff powder) from the collection of the Royal Botanical Gardens at Kew (London, UK) were analysed by liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry. Results showed a wide range of polar and less-polar/apolar molecules which are preserved in dried botanical material, providing information optimal for metabolomic studies. The metabolomic profiles of historical dried samples were distinct enough to classify as Nicotiana tabacum or Nicotiana rustica, and showed differences based on geographic provenance or product transformation/processing. Statistical models based on the molecular data from the historical material permitted us to validate the labelling of the historical collection, which identified one possible mislabelled specimen and offered some clues as to the species of one unknown Nicotiana sample. Finally, metabolomic differences in profiles between Nicotiana tabacum and modern cigars showed that both share a large proportion of their metabolomic profile, where molecular differences could be possibly associated with both location of growth and anthropogenic transformation suffered by the plant in the last two centuries. This study demonstrates that dry botanical collections are a feasible source of information, and, if applied to a large set of individuals, conclusions may be drawn about the possible evolution and anthropogenic modification over time in plant material. The results are significant for disciplines interested in the history of plants, such as botany, history and archaeology.</p>",

These are currently thought to be the most frequently used tobacco plants in the past<strong>[1]</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p>An <em>in-situ</em> micro-sampling of 8 Nicotiana species from the Royal Botanical Gardens of Kew (London, UK) was performed. The specimens selected represented <em>Nicotiana tabacum</em> and <em>Nicotiana rustica</em> species plus 1 specimen of unknown species. All but 1 of these samples were preserved as dried leaves, with the other being a snuff (powder) tobacco (see <strong>Fig. 1</strong> and <strong>Table 1</strong> in the paper associated with this study). The micro-sampling was performed on plant areas where there would be minimal impact to the integrity of the plant, endeavouring to take material that was already loose. Less than 200 mg were extracted from each sample and stored in individual pre-labelled containers for analysis (for reference, 1 single dry leaf of N.T. weighs &gt;5 g).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Modern samples:</strong></p><p>Tobacco is a product that results from the cutting of leaves from a <em>Nicotiana</em> genus plant. Depending on the drying process (curation), size reduction (powdering, cutting, etc.), and consumption, different products are produced for the market, i.e., cigars, chewing tobacco, cigarettes, snuff, etc. Cigars are one of the most famous tobacco products formed by rolling up different leaves after being cut from the plant and dried naturally with no use of heat. This produces a set of dry leaves that, when combusted, produce a specific smoke with specific sensorial characteristics according to the chemical composition of the leaves.</p><p><br></p><p>To contrast the molecular composition found in the dry <em>Nicotiana tabacum</em> samples from the historical collection with modern samples, 4 different handmade modern cigars manufactured from <em>Nicotiana tabacum</em> leaves were purchased from a recognized online provider. Only cigars were selected, as the lack of curation with heat means they are in a similar condition to samples found in historical collections, as opposed to cigarette tobacco which is treated/curated or modified after harvesting. Each cigar was manually dissected, and the different leaves were separated into wrapper, binder, and filler, with each leaf considered as a single sample. Individual leaves were collected in pre-labelled containers for a total of 12 samples (see <strong>Fig. 2</strong> and <strong>Table 2</strong> in the paper associated with this study).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Hughes J.

The supernatant was transferred in a total recovery glass LC-MS vial before their LC-MS measurement.</p><p><br></p><p>Untargeted analyses were performed on a high flow Acquity UPLC system coupled to a Waters Synapt G2 HDMS system (Waters Corporation, Manchester). Chromatographic separations were carried out by using both a reversed phase (RP) C18 column (Waters Acquity UPLC BEH C18 column (2.1 x 100 mm, 1.7 \u03bcm)) for semi-polar and apolar metabolites, and a hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography column (Acquity UPLC BEH HILIC (2.1 x 100 mm, 1.7 \u03bcm)) for polar metabolites. Samples were maintained at 4 \u00b0C in the auto sampler and aliquots of 5 \u03bcl injected per run. The flow rate was set at 0.4 ml/min, and the column temperature was maintained at 40 \u00b1 2 \u00b0C. Solvents used for separation consisted of 0.1% Formic Acid in water as mobile phase A, and 0.1% Formic acid in Acetonitrile as mobile phase B. The RP gradient elution program started running at 2% B, held for 1 min, then mobile phase B was linearly increased to 20% to minute 5, 25% in minute 6, 75% in minute 7, and 98% in minute 7.5, then was held at 98% of B until minute 8, going back to initial conditions of 98% of A in minute 9, and equilibrated the column until minute 10. The HILIC gradient elution program started running at 3% A and held for 1 min, then mobile phase A was linearly increased to 20% in 3 min, 25% in 1 min, 75% in 2 min, and 97% in 1 min, then was held for 30 s, going back to initial conditions of 97% of B in 1.5 min to later be equilibrated for 4 min.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Quality assurance (QA):</strong></p><p>To ensure the quality of the metabolomic study, QA procedures were carried out during all the workflow steps in aims to reduce the unwanted variation regarding the pre-analytical, analytical and post-analytical phase of metabolomics<strong>[1]-[4]</strong>. To establish that the liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry instrument was clean and consistent for the metabolomic studies, a series of 4\u20136 injections of <strong>pure solvent (injection blank sample)</strong> were run at the beginning of each sequence. To evaluate the quality of the extraction process and filter out later from the MS data the possible interferences from the extraction process, <strong>extraction blank samples</strong> were injected 3 times randomly during each sequence. To stabilize the MS platform and obtain MS control samples for the posterior data treatment, <strong>pooled quality control (QC)</strong> samples were prepared individually for each chromatographic separation technique by mixing 5 \u03bcl of each extracted sample after their reconstitution. The QC samples were injected 6 times at the beginning of each chromatographic sequence after the injections of instrumental blank samples. QC samples were also injected after each 6\u20138 randomized samples to monitor the stability of the analytical platform and after each extraction blank injection to preserve the stability of the MS instrument. To avoid instrumental and statistical bias, all biological samples were randomized before injection. To test the technical variability and possible carryover in the instrument during the injection of the different sequences, <strong>a quality control standard mixture (LC-MS QC STD Part number 186006963\u20131, Waters)</strong> was injected at the beginning and at the end of each sequence and r. t. And ions evaluated.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Beger RD, Dunn WB, Bandukwala A, Bethan B, Broadhurst D, Clish CB, Dasari S, Derr L et al.
