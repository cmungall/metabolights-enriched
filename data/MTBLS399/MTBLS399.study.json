                "description": "Pseudostellariae Radix (PR) is an important traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), which is consumed commonly for its positive health effects. However, the chemical differences of PR from different cultivated fields and germplasms are still unknown. In order to comprehensively compare the chemical compositions of PR from different cultivated fields , in this study 1H-NMR-based metabolomics coupled with HPLC were used to investigate the different metabolites in PR from five germplasms (jr, zs1, zs2, sb, and xc) cultivated in traditional field (Jurong, Jiangsu, JSJR) and cultivated field (Zherong, Fujian,FJZR). A total of 34 metabolites were identified based on 1H-NMR data, and fourteen of them were found to be different in PR from JSJR and FJZR. The relative contents of alanine, lactate, lysine, taurine, sucrose, tyrosine, linolenic acid, \u03b3-aminobutyrate, and hyperoside in PR from JSJR were higher than that in PR from FJZR, while PR from FJZR contained higher levels of glutamine, raffinose, xylose, unsaturated fatty acid, and formic acid. The contents of Heterophyllin A and Heterophyllin B were higher in PR from FJZR. This study will provide the basic information for exploring the influence law of ecological environment and germplasm genetic variation on metabolite biosynthesis of PR and its quality formation mechanism.",

A presaturation sequence was used to suppress the residual H2O signal with low-power selective irradiation at the H2O frequency during the recycle delay. Free induction decays (FIDs) were Fourier transformed with Luria\u2013Bertani (LB) = 0.3. The resulting spectra were manually phased and baseline-corrected, and calibrated to TSP at 0.00 ppm.",

The two regions of d = 3.355-3.363 and 4.67\u20134.98 were excluded from analysis because of the residual signals of methanol and water. The integral data (d = 0.50 to d = 10.00, except for d = 3.355-3.363 and 4.67\u20134.98) were normalized according to peak areas and imported to Microsoft Office Excel (Redmond, WA, USA) for the following analysis. The integral data obtained were imported to SIMCA-P 11.5 (Umetrics, Umea, Sweden) for multivariate statistical analysis, including principal component analysis (PCA), partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), and orthogonal PLS-DA (OPLS-DA) with VIP > 1.
