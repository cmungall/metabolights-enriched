                "description": "Hyocholic acid (HCA) is a major bile acid (BA) species in the BA pool of pigs, a species known for its exceptional resistance to spontaneous development of diabetic phenotypes. HCA and its derivatives are also present in human blood and urine. We investigate whether human HCA profiles can predict the development of metabolic disorders. We find in the first cohort (n\u2009=\u20091107) that both obesity and diabetes are associated with lower serum concentrations of HCA species. A separate cohort study (n\u2009=\u200991) validates this finding and further reveals that individuals with pre-diabetes are associated with lower levels of HCA species in feces. Serum HCA levels increase in the patients after gastric bypass surgery (n\u2009=\u200938) and can predict the remission of diabetes two years after surgery. The results are replicated in two independent, prospective cohorts (n\u2009=\u2009132 and n\u2009=\u2009207), where serum HCA species are found to be strong predictors for metabolic disorders in 5 and 10 years, respectively. These findings underscore the association of HCA species with diabetes, and demonstrate the feasibility of using HCA profiles to assess the future risk of developing metabolic abnormalities.",

Beginning in 2009, the SHOS recruited participants from four communities in Shanghai, China. The participants that were selected satisfied the criteria for overweight/obese and diabetes (see the paper associated with this study for the full exclusion criteria). According to these criteria, a total of 1,107 subjects with fasting serum samples were selected prior to bile acid (BA) analysis. This cohort included 585 HL (329 men and 256 women), 419 HO (229 men and 190 women) and 103 OD (52 men and 51 women) participants. We further selected 103 subjects from each group with matched age, sex and BMI as a matched cohort.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Human study 2, cross-sectional study 2 (Cohort2):</strong></p><p>A group of 91 subjects including 26 healthy controls (9 men and 17 women), 30 individuals with pre-diabetes (10 men and 20 women) and 35 patients with diabetes (16 men and 19 women) were recruited for this study. The exclusion criteria were the same as in human study 1. Fasting sera and fecal samples of 91 participants were collected and stored for later analysis.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Human study 3, Gastric bypass surgery intervention study (Cohort3):</strong></p><p>A total of 38 patients with obesity and diabetes who received RYGB surgery were enrolled in the study<strong>[2]</strong>. Any patient with a history of open abdominal surgery, a serious disease (such as heart or lung insufficiency) that was incompatible with surgery, an acute T2DM complication, severe alcohol or drug dependency, a mental disorder, type 1 diabetes, secondary diabetes, an unstable psychiatric illness, or who was at a relatively high surgical risk (such as a patient with an active ulcer) was excluded. The fasting serum specimens of these subjects were collected and stored for future analysis before (baseline) and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after the surgery.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Human study 4, a 10-year longitudinal study (Cohort4):</strong></p><p>A group of 132 subjects (36 men and 96 women) were selected from the Shanghai Diabetes Study, which was intended to assess the prevalence of diabetes and diabetes-associated metabolic disorders in urban Shanghai<strong>[3]</strong>. All 132 subjects were metabolically healthy at baseline (the year 2000-2001). 10 years later (year 2010-2011), 86 participants (26 men and 60 women) became metabolically unhealthy (future metabolically unhealthy) and 46 participants (10 men and 36 women) remained healthy (future metabolically healthy). Fasting serum samples of the 132 participants at baseline were collected and stored for future analysis. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Human study 5, a 5-year longitudinal study&nbsp;(Cohort5):</strong></p><p>A group of 207 subjects (117 men and 90 women) were selected from the physical examination centers in Beijing. All 207 subjects were metabolically healthy at baseline (the year 2011). 5 years later (the year 2016), 90 participants (60 men and 30 women) became metabolically unhealthy (future metabolically unhealthy) and 117 participants (57 men and 60 women) remained healthy (future metabolically healthy). Fasting serum samples of the 207 participants at baseline were collected and stored for future analysis.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Criteria for lean, overweight/obesity, pre-diabetes, diabetes, metabolically healthy and unhealthy status:</strong></p><p>Individuals with BMI &lt; 25 kg/m^2 were considered lean and those with BMI \u2265 25 were classified as overweight/obese. Individuals with 6.1 mmol/l \u2264 fasting blood glucose &lt; 7.0 mmol/l or 7.8 mmol/l \u2264 oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) (2 h) &lt; 11.1 mmol/l were classified as pre-diabetic. Subjects with fasting blood glucose \u2265 7.0 mmol/l and/or OGTT (2 h) \u2265 11.1 mmol/l were classified as diabetic. Subjects were considered 'metabolically healthy' if they met all of the following criteria: fasting blood glucose &lt; 6.1 mmol/l, OGTT (2 h) &lt; 7.8 mmol/l and no previous history of diabetes; systolic blood pressure (SP)/diastolic blood pressure (DP) &lt; 140/90 mmHg and no previous history of high blood pressure; fasting plasma TG&lt; 1.7 mmol/l and fasting plasma high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL) \u2265 0.9 mmol/l (men) or \u2265 1.0 mmol/l (women), and no previous history of high cholesterol (total cholesterol (TC) &lt; 5.18 mmol/l); no history of cardiovascular or endocrine disease<strong>[4]</strong>. Those who failed to meet all criteria above were classified as 'metabolically unhealthy'. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Clinical measurements and sample collection:</strong></p><p>All human samples were collected, stored and measured following the standard operating protocol of the hospital. Participants were given a standard 75-g OGTT after an overnight fast of more than 8 h. Venous blood samples were drawn at 0 (fasting), 30, 60 and 120 min. Fasting and postprandial plasma glucose and insulin levels, fasting serum lipid profiles (TC, TG, HDL-c, LDL-c), blood pressure (SP and DP), waist circumference, BMI, liver and kidney function tests were determined as previously described<strong>[4][5]</strong>. The blood samples were centrifuged for plasma or serum collection, and then divided into aliquots and delivered on dry ice to the study laboratory. Fecal samples from the recruited subjects were collected in the sterile feces containers (Cat  80.9924.014, SARSTEDT). Each sample was either frozen immediately at -80 \u00b0C or briefly stored in personal -20 \u00b0C freezers before transport to the laboratory within 24 h. All samples were stored in a -80 \u00b0C freezer until analysis.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Bao Y, Ma X, Yang R, Wang F, Hao Y, Dou J, He H, Jia W.
