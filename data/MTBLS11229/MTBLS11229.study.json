                "description": "Paurocephala sauteri Enderlein, one of the most important pests of mulberry trees in the tropical and subtropical regions, the nymphs and adults of this species penetrate the veins on the back of leaves and buds of mulberry trees, nymph and female adult can secrete wax, these wax accumulated on the mulberry leaves significantly effect photosynthesis of leaves and silkworm cultivation. Therefore, this study aimed to clearly understand the wax-secreting system and characteristics of wax secretion, and see if there is any possible strategy to control the species population from angle of the wax-secreting process. The main findings were as follow: scanning electron microscopy revealed that the nymphs and female adults secreted wax in the form of long tubes with spherical ends, male adults only secreted honeydew. Additionally, the wax-secreting system of the nymphs and female adults were different, the nymph owned a bending moon-shaped wax gland, the first instar nymph wax gland was consisted of one circle of rectangular and depressed cells, but second to fifth instar nymph wax gland was made of one circle of rectangular and depressed cells, and one circle of round depressed cells. There were a certain number of white pores inside of these depressed cells. Wax filaments produced by these pores converted the into dense, tight and hollow wax tube. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry showed that the main constituents of P. sauteri wax were hydrocarbons. Wax tube as a water conservation pool during the P. sauteri developmental process, this physiological feature may as a key point for a potential strategy to control P. sauteri, even other secreting insects.",

A gas chromatograph coupled with a mass spectrometer (GC/MS, Agilent 7890A+5975C)&nbsp;was used to detect and analyse the components of P. sauteri&nbsp;wax filaments. We used an Agilent 19091S-433 chromatographic column (30 m x 0.25 mm x 0.25 \u03bcm), with the following conditions: sample size: 1.0 \u03bcL; temperature at sample inlet: up to 250 \u00b0C; carrier medium: high-purity helium; and column speed: 1.0 mL/min. The following temperature adjustment cycle was used: 80 \u00b0C&nbsp;for 1 min, followed by up to 150 \u00b0C&nbsp;at a rate of 5 \u00b0C/min for 2 min and up to 320 \u00b0C&nbsp;at a rate of 10 \u00b0C/min for 10 min. The total speed of split sampling was 14.0 mL/min, and electron ionization&nbsp;was completely scanned.
