                "title": "Genome-scale metabolic modelling of responses to polymyxins in Pseudomonas aeruginosa",
                "description": "Background: Pseudomonas aeruginosa often causes multidrug-resistant infections in immunocompromised patients and polymyxins are often used as the last-line therapy. Alarmingly, resistance to polymyxins has been increasingly reported worldwide recently. To rescue this last-resort class of antibiotics, it is necessary to systematically understand how P. aeruginosa alters its metabolism in response to polymyxin treatment, thereby facilitating the development of effective therapies. To this end, a genome-scale metabolic model (GSMM) was employed to analyse bacterial metabolic changes at the systems level. Findings: A high-quality GSMM iPAO1 was constructed for P. aeruginosa PAO1 for antimicrobial pharmacological research. Model iPAO1 encompasses an additional periplasmic compartment and contains 3,022 metabolites, 4,265 reactions and 1,458 genes in total. Growth prediction on 190 carbon and 95 nitrogen sources achieved an accuracy of 89.1%, outperforming all reported P. aeruginosa models. Notably, prediction of the essential genes for growth achieved a high accuracy of 87.9%. Metabolic simulation showed that lipid A modifications associated with polymyxin resistance exert a limited impact on bacterial growth and metabolism, but remarkably change the physiochemical properties of the outer membrane. Modelling with transcriptomics constraints revealed a broad range of metabolic responses to polymyxin treatment, including reduced biomass synthesis, upregulated amino acids catabolism, induced flux through the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and increased redox turnover. Conclusions: Overall, iPAO1 represents the most comprehensive GSMM constructed to date for Pseudomonas. It provides a powerful systems pharmacology platform for the elucidation of complex killing mechanisms of antibiotics.",

A single colony was then inoculated into 10 ml of cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton broth (CaMHB, Oxoid) and incubated for overnight at 37 \u00b0C with shaking at 150 rpm. The overnight culture was diluted by 1:100 into 5 different reservoirs with 100 ml fresh CaMHB media and then grown to an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.50 (~10^8 CFU/ml). The bacterial cultures of PAK was then treated with polymyxin B at 4 mg/l for 1 and 4 hr. The untreated bacterial cultures served as a control sample.  Control and treatment samples (n=3) at 4 hr were collected for lipid A profiling; whereas only control samples (n=5) at 1 hr were collected for lipidomics study. To ensure the bacterial cell counts were comparable at each time point, the bacterial cultures were normalized according to OD600 of 0.50.\n</p>\nThe culture of P. aeruginosa PAO1 was prepared on a nutrient agar plate from the frozen stock (-80 \u00b0C) and incubated for 16-18 hr at 37 \u00b0C.

In brief, the bacterial cell pellets were harvested from 100 ml of normalized culture (OD600 = 0.50) via centrifugation at 3,220 x g for 20 min and washed twice with 5 ml PBS. The cell pellets were then re-suspended in 4 ml PBS, and followed by 5 ml chloroform and 10 ml methanol to make a single-phase Bligh-Dyer (chloroform/methanol/water, 1:2:0.8, v/v). After 15-min centrifugation at 3,220 x g, the supernatant was removed and left LPS in the pellets. After one washing with 5 ml single-phase Bligh-Dyer solvent, the LPS pellets were re-suspended in 10.8 ml of hydrolysis buffer (50 mM sodium acetate pH 4.5 with 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate [SDS]) and homogenized via sonication through a probe tip sonicator (Misonix, USA) at a constant duty cycle (20 s at 50% output). The samples were then incubated in a boiling water bath for 45 min and allowed to cool to room temperature. To extract lipids after hydrolysis, 12 ml chloroform and 12 ml methanol were added to the 10.8 ml hydrolysis solution to make a double-phase Bligh-Dyer (chloroform/methanol/water, 1:1:0.9, v/v). The lower phase containing lipid A was finally collected and dried under nitrogen gas stream. Structural analysis of lipid A was performed using mass spectrometry in negative ion mode on a Q-Exactive Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap Mass Spectrometer.\n</p>\nLipidomics analysis for PAK:</br>\nFor lipidomics study, cellular metabolites of PAK were extracted by a previously optimized method with slight modifications. Briefly, the untreated samples were collected at 1 hr for metabolite extraction. For the fingerprint samples (i.e. intracellular metabolites), 20 ml of the bacterial culture was collected and immediately transferred into a 50 ml ice-cold falcon tube. The samples were then shortly quenched in a dry ice/ethanol bath for ~30 s to stop the metabolic processes. Samples were then normalized according to OD600 at 0.50  to ensure the bacterial cell counts are at ~10^8 CFU/ml. The cell pellets were then collected after centrifugation at 3,220 x g at 4 \u00b0C for 10 min, while the supernatant was collected for extracellular metabolites (i.e. footprint). After washing twice with 2 ml ice-cold 0.9% NaCl, the cell pellets were then resuspended in 500 \u00b5l chloroform/methanol/water (CMW, 1:3:1, v/v) containing 1 \u00b5M generic internal standards (CHAPS, CAPS, PIPES and TRIS). A triple freeze-thaw process was followed to lyse the cells and release cellular metabolites. The extracted samples were centrifuged at 3,220 x g at 4 \u00b0C for 10 min and 300 \u00b5l supernatant was collected, which is followed by a further centrifugation at 14,000 x g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C to obtain particle-free supernatants (200 \u00b5l) for LC-MS analysis. For footprint samples, 10 \u00b5l of the filtered supernatant was mixed with 250 \u00b5l of CMW (1:3:1, v/v) solution and then centrifuged at 14,000 x g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C to collect 200 \u00b5l particle-free supernatant for LC-MS analysis.\n</p>\nMetabolomics analysis for PAO1:</br>\nCellular metabolites of P. aeruginosa PAO1 were extracted by the previously optimized method with slight modifications. Samples were collected 1 hr from untreated and polymyxin treatment (1 mg/l) groups for metabolite extraction and viable counting. For the fingerprint samples (i.e. intracellular metabolites), 20 ml of the bacterial culture was collected and immediately transferred onto the ice. Quickly, all the samples were quenched in a dry ice/ethanol bath and preserved on ice for all following steps. Samples were normalized by optical density (OD600 nm) of ~0.5 (~10^8 CFU/ml). The samples then were centrifuged for 10 min at 3,220 x g at 4 \u00b0C. The cell pellets were washed 3 times with 0.9% NaCl (4 \u00b0C) and centrifuged for 3 min at 3,220 x g at 4 \u00b0C. Cellular metabolites were extracted with chloroform:methanol:water (CMW; 1:3:1, v/v; -80 \u00b0C) (total volume of 250 \u00b5l) containing generic internal standards (CHAPS, CAPS, PIPES and TRIS) at 1 \u00b5M. Samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and allowed to thaw on ice, and the freeze-thaw process was repeated 3 times to lyse the cells and release cellular metabolites. The extracted samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 3,220 x g at 4 \u00b0C and the supernatant was collected and further centrifuged at 14,000 x g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C.

The mass scanning range was from 85 to 1,275 m/z.\n</p>\nThe injection sample volume was 10 \u00b5l and the run time was 32 min. All samples were analysed in the same run and the chromatographic peaks, signal reproducibility and analyte stability were monitored by assessment of pooled biological quality control (PBQC) samples (aliquot of 10 \u00b5l of each sample) analysed periodically throughout the batch, internal standards and total ion chromatograms for each sample. Mixtures of pure standards containing over 200 metabolites were analysed within the batch to aid in the identification of metabolites.",

Mzmatch.R was also used to retrieve LC-MS peak intensities for missing peaks and for the annotation of related peaks. Unwanted noise and artefact peaks were eliminated using IDEOM with default parameters. Metabolites were putatively identified by the exact mass within 2 ppm, after correction for loss or gain of a proton in negative and positive ESI mode, respectively. Retention time was employed to confirm the identification of each metabolite based on the available authentic standards. Putative identification of other metabolites was determined using exact mass and predicted retention time based on the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), MetaCyc and LIPIDMAPS databases, with preference given to bacterial metabolites annotated in EcoCyc. Quantification of each metabolite was calculated using the raw peak height and is expressed relative to the average peak height for their paired susceptible strain.",
