                "description": "Methodologies for untargeted metabolomic profiling using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) were developed and applied to lipid-depleted methanolic extracts of soybeans seeds obtained from four near isogenic soybean lines (NILs) that differed in phytate content. The four lines differed in mutations for genes encoding two highly homologous multi-drug resistant proteins (MRPs). The double mutant exhibited the low phytate/emergence phenotype whereas the other three NILs, namely the two single mutants and the wild type, did not. Lipid-depleted aqueous methanol extracts were analyzed by orthogonal chromatographic separations (reversed-phase and hydrophilic interaction) in both positive and negative ionization modes. Principal component analysis (PCA) of the LC-MS data clearly separated the low phytate line from the other three, with the major metabolite differences residing in the soyasaponin composition. Group A soyasaponins containing C22-terminated acetylated glucosides were of much lower concentration in the low phytate line, which favored terminally acetylated xyloside-based soyasaponins (soyasaponin A4, A5 and A6). Differing levels of the allergen Gly m 1 were also detected.",

Three replicates of each sample were injected randomly for each column/ionization mode format. Master mixes were prepared for each class (DM, WT, SM3, SM19) by combining aliquots (10 \u00b5l each) of the three biological replicates, with a complete master mix of all classes created by combining aliquots (10 \u00b5l) of the four class master mixes.  An analysis 'set' consisted of 3 blank injections followed by 3 complete master mix injections (for column conditioning).  A random set of all samples (17) plus a blank injection was then repeated three times in the same randomized order, which was generated at https://www.random.org.\n</p>\nReversed-Phase Separations.</br>\nDried extracts were reconstituted with 0.1% aqueous formic acid: acetonitrile (MeCN, 9:1, v/v, 120 \u00b5L). Samples were briefly vortexed and sonicated for 10 min, followed by centrifugation (13k x g, 10 min, RT). An aliquot (10 \u00b5l) was transferred to an LC-MS-grade vial and diluted with 90 \u00b5l of 0.1% aqueous formic acid:MeCN (9:1, v/v). Sample separation was achieved with a binary solvent system of 0.1% formic acid (A) and MeCN (B) utilizing an Acquity UPLC BEH C18 column (1.7 \u00b5m, 2.1 mm x 50 mm, Waters Corp., Milford, MA) with flow rate 200 \u00b5l/min and a 15 min gradient. The following gradient conditions were used: isocratic at 5% B (0-1 min), followed by linear gradient to 15% B (1-2 min), to 95% B (2-11 min), isocratic at 95% B (11-12.5 min), followed by return to initial conditions (12.5-15 min). Injection volume into the column was 2 \u00b5l. The separated samples were ionized by electrospray ionization and analyzed in both positive and negative modes. The scan time was set to 0.20 sec and a mass range of 50-1800 m/z was scanned. The source parameters for positive ion mode were source temperature 125 \u00b0C, capillary voltage 3.0, cone voltage 70, source offset 80, desolvation temperature 300 \u00b0C, cone gas 50 l/h, desolvation gas 500 l/h and nebulizer gas 6.0 bar. The source parameters for negative ion mode were source temperature 125 \u00b0C, capillary voltage 2.4, cone voltage 40, source offset 80, desolvation temperature 300 \u00b0C, cone gas 50 l/h, desolvation gas 500 l/h and nebulizer gas 6.0 bar.

MarkerLynx generated a data matrix consisting of all exact match-retention time pairs (EMRTs) found in the datasets along with their normalized peak areas. The EZinfo 2.0 software (Umetrics, Umea, Sweden) was used to conduct principal component analyses (PCA) and orthogonal partial least squared discriminate analyses (OPLS-DA) of the EMRT datasets.
