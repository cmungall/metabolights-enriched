                "description": "<p><em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> is a leading cause of community-acquired pneumonia and bacteraemia and is capable of remarkable phenotypic plasticity, responding rapidly to environmental change. Pneumococcus is a nasopharyngeal commensal, but is responsible for severe, acute infections following dissemination within-host. Pneumococcus is adept at utilising host resources, but the airways are compartmentalised and those resources are not evenly distributed. Challenges and opportunities in metabolite acquisition within different airway niches may contribute to the commensal-pathogen switch when pneumococcus moves from nasopharynx into lungs. We used NMR to characterise the metabolic landscape of the mouse airways, in health and during infection. Using paired nasopharynx and lung samples from na\u00efve animals, we identified fundamental differences in metabolite bioavailability between airway niches. Pneumococcal pneumonia was associated with rapid and dramatic shifts in the lung metabolic environment, whilst nasopharyngeal carriage led to only modest change in upper airway metabolite profiles. NMR spectra derived from the nasopharynx of mice infected with closely-related pneumococcal strains that differ in their colonisation potential could be distinguished from one another using multivariate dimensionality reduction methods. The resulting models highlighted that increased branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) bioavailability in nasopharynx is a feature of infection with the high colonisation potential strain. Subsequent analysis revealed increased expression of BCAA transport genes and increased intracellular concentrations of BCAA in that same strain. Movement from upper to lower airway environments is associated with shifting challenges in metabolic resource allocation for pneumococci. Efficient biosynthesis, liberation or acquisition of BCAA is a feature of adaptation to nasopharyngeal colonisation.</p>",

The nasopharynx adapted strains used were <strong>D39_C20-1</strong>, <strong>D39_C20-3</strong>, <strong>D39_C20-6</strong> and <strong>D39_C20-10</strong>.

The principles of the Declaration of Helsinki were observed throughout. Mice, Balb/c inbred mice (4-6 wk old females) (Charles River, Oxford, UK) were housed in individually ventilated cages, with access to food and water ad libitum. Environmental enrichment was provided in all cages and mice were acclimatised to the animal unit for at least 7 d before use. Mice were randomly allocated to cages on arrival in the animal unit by staff with no role in study design.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Lung tissue:</strong></p><p>For NMR profiling of lung tissue, 3 groups each containing 10 mice were selected: <strong>1)</strong> A lung control group; <strong>2)</strong> A lung test group that was infected with <strong>D39 wild type <em>S. pneumoniae</em>;</strong> and <strong>3)</strong> A lung test group that was infected with a <strong>D39-derived, lung adapted lineage (D39_P20-10)</strong>. To induce pneumonia, mice were infected intranasally under light anaesthesia, using a mix of oxygen and isoflurane, with 1 x 10^6 colony forming units (CFU), in 50 \u03bcl PBS. For the control (sham) group, mice were administered 50 \u03bcl of PBS intranasally.

The intact lung samples were dipped in ice-cold PBS solution, pH 7.4, to remove any blood surrounding the organ. Lungs were placed into 1.5 ml bead beating tubes, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 \u00b0C until metabolite extraction (for a period of no more than 3 mth). From the lung control group, the nasopharynx tissues were also dissected, as soon as the lungs were removed, in order to compare the NMR profiles of the lung with the nasopharynx, in the absence of pneumococcal infection. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Nasopharynx tissue:</strong></p><p>For NMR profiling of nasopharynx tissue, 3 groups each containing 10 mice were selected: <strong>1)</strong> A nasopharynx control group; <strong>2)</strong> Nasopharynx test group infected with 10 \u03bcl <strong>D39</strong>;&nbsp;and <strong>3)</strong> A nasopharynx test group infected with 10 \u03bcl of a <strong>D39-derived, nasopharynx adapted lineage (D39_C20-3)</strong>.

Nasopharynx dissection was carried out following the revised guides for organ sampling and trimming in rats and mice<strong>[3]</strong>. Tissue was collected in a region between the posterior part of the upper incisors and the second palatine crest. All tissue contained within the skull between these 2 regions was collected.

Each frozen sample was re-suspended in 0.8 ml ice-cold extraction solvent (50:50 [v/v]) acetonitrile/water. A bead beating protocol was used to homogenise the lung and nasopharynx tissues for metabolite extraction. For the lungs, 0.5 g of 2.8 mm diameter ceramic beads were added to tissues and, for the nasopharynx, 0.25 g of beads were used. Each tube was bead bashed for 3 min in total using a BeadBug tissue homogeniser (Sigma Aldrich, Gillingham, UK), in cycles of 1 min with tubes put on ice between cycles. This process was carried out in a cold room, maintained between 2-4 \u00b0C. After homogenisation the lysate was transferred to fresh 1.5 ml microfuge tubes and centrifuged at 4 \u00b0C for 10 min at 21,500 x g. The supernatants were then transferred into fresh 1.5 ml microfuge tubes, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 \u00b0C until they were transferred on dry ice to University of Liverpool NMR Centre for lyophilisation and NMR profiling. The cell pellets were also frozen down and stored at -80 \u00b0C in case further extraction of samples was required.</p><p><br></p><p>Supernatants from extracted samples were processed at the University of Liverpool NMR centre.
