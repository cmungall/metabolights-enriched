                "description": "Metabolomic approaches, such as in clinical applications of living individuals, have shown potential use for solving questions regarding the past when applied to archaeological material. Here, we study for the first time the potential of this Omic approach as applied to metabolites extracted from archaeological human dentin. Dentin obtained from micro sampling the dental pulp of teeth of victims and non-victims of <i>Yersinia pestis</i> (plague) from a 6th century Cambridgeshire site are used to evaluate the potential use of such unique material for untargeted metabolomic studies on disease state through liquid chromatography hyphenated to high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS). Results show that small molecules of both likely endogenous and exogenous sources are preserved for a range of polar and less polar/apolar metabolites in archaeological dentin; however, untargeted metabolomic profiles show no clear differentiation between healthy and infected individuals in the small sample analysed (<i>n</i> = 20). This study discusses the potential of dentin as a source of small molecules for metabolomic assays and highlights: (1) the need for follow up research to optimise sampling protocols, (2) the requirements of studies with larger sample numbers and (3) the necessity of more databases to amplify the positive results achievable with this Omic technique in the archaeological sciences.",

The unexpected discovery of <em>Y. pestis</em> at the site<strong>[5]</strong> opened new pathways for investigation into the spread and impact of the Plague of Justinian (541\u2013549 CE), part of the First Pandemic (541\u2013750 CE). Using metagenomic screening of aDNA from tooth roots, at least 10 victims of plague were identified<strong>[6]</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p>20 individuals were selected for the untargeted metabolomic study (see <strong>Table 1</strong> in the paper associated with this study) according to the following: first, 100 individuals from the site of Edix Hill were screened for human and pathogen DNA<strong>[6]</strong> using an established pipeline (see<strong>[2]</strong>); of these, 10 individuals with a positive identification of ancient <em>Yersinia pestis</em> DNA in a tooth were chosen, then each individual was matched by estimated morphological age and genetic sex to an additional individual that did not have any ancient <em>Y. pestis</em> DNA identified.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Dentin Sampling:</strong></p><p>The same teeth used for the metagenomic screening were micro-sampled by drilling the open bottom of the root canal (of the root used for the screening) using a sterilised engraving drill tip and stored in a DNA lo-bind 1.5 ml tube. Masses varying between 14 and 65 mg were obtained depending on the tooth. Samples with enough mass were split into 3 to obtain biological replicates for the metabolomic study for a total of 42 samples as indicated in <strong>Table 1</strong> of the paper associated with this study.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Malim T and Hines J.

Untargeted analyses were performed on a high-flow Acquity UPLC system coupled to a Waters Synapt G2 HDMS system (Waters Corporation, Manchester). Chromatographic separations were carried out by using both a reversed phase (RP) C18 column (Waters Acquity UPLC BEH C18 column (2.1 x 100 mm, 1.7 \u03bcm)) for semi-polar and apolar metabolites, and a hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography column (Acquity UPLC BEH HILIC (2.1 x 100 mm, 1.7 \u03bcm)) for polar metabolites. Samples were maintained at 4 \u00b0C in the autosampler and aliquots of 5 \u03bcl injected per run. The flow rate was set at 0.4 ml/min, and the column temperature was maintained at 40 \u00b1 2 \u00b0C. Solvents used for separation consisted of 0.1% formic acid in water as mobile phase A, and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile as mobile phase B. The RP gradient elution program started running at 2% B, held for 1 min, then mobile phase B was linearly increased to 20% to minute 5, 25% in minute 6, 75% in minute 7 and 98% in minute 7.5, then held at 98% of B until minute 8, going back to initial conditions of 98% of A in minute 9 and the column was equilibrated until minute 10. The HILIC gradient elution program started running at 3% A and held for 1 min, then mobile phase A was linearly increased to 20% in 3 min, 25% in 1 min, 75% in 2 min and 97% in 1 min, then was held for 30 s, going back to initial conditions of 97% of B in 1.5 min to later be equilibrated for 4 min.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Quality Assurance (QA):</strong></p><p>QA procedures were performed to reduce the unwanted variation regarding the pre-analytical, analytical and post-analytical phase during all the metabolomics workflow<strong>[1]</strong>. Blank injections of pure solvent were run to condition the LC-MS system and obtain the MS data for later data processing. Extraction blank injections were performed to evaluate the extraction process and determine the MS data which could interfere with the biological information from the different samples. Pooled quality control (QC) samples were prepared by mixing 5 \u00b5l of each extracted sampled after their reconstitution. QC samples were injected at the beginning of the sequence to stabilise the MS instrument, as well as bracketing the biological samples during the total sequence after each 6-8 randomised samples to monitor the stability of the analytical platform. To avoid instrumental and statistical bias, all biological samples were randomised before injection. A quality control standard mixture (LC-MS QC STD Part number 186006963-1, Waters) was used to test the technical variability and possible carry over of the instrument during the injection of the different sequences, being the r.t. and ions evaluated at the beginning and at the end of each sequence.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Badillo-Sanchez D, Ruber MS, Davies-Barrett AM, Sandhu JK, Jones DJL, Hansen M, Inskip SA.

Resultant compound metabolomic matrices containing the different samples and the total list of compounds detected for each experiment were inspected manually by using <strong>Microsoft Excel 2016</strong> to filter out the non-biological information (noise, instrumental signals, compounds from the extraction process, etc.) For that, compounds with a contribution higher than 5% of the blank or extraction blank with respect to the QCs were filtered out. Furthermore, the compounds with a relative standard deviation (RSD) for the QC samples greater than 40% were removed. Before any further statistical analysis, data transformation was applied to the different data matrices. K-nearest neighbours based on similar features was employed to replace missing values and mean sample normalization; log10 data transformation; and Pareto data scaling were applied to the different sets of data.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Badillo-Sanchez D, Ruber MS, Davies-Barrett AM, Sandhu JK, Jones DJL, Hansen M, Inskip SA.

Multivariate statistical analyses, including unsupervised <strong>principal component analysis (PCA)</strong>, were used to establish the overall differences in the metabolic profiles between groups studied. The quality of the established statistical models was evaluated using the R2X, R2Y and Q2 parameters, as well as permutation tests to evaluate the possible overfitting in supervised models. Statistical models were performed including QC samples to evaluate stability of the analytical system and the data quality, using as indicator the clustering of QC samples in successive injections during the sequences. Univariate tests were performed to visualise significant features up-regulated or down-regulated and volcano plots were drawn by transferring the <strong>fold change (FC)</strong> value of each substance peak to <strong>log2 (FC)</strong> and transferring the <strong>p value (p = 0.05)</strong> of <strong>Student\u2019s t-test</strong> to <strong>\u2212log10 (p value)</strong>.
