                "description": "The use of glucocorticoids as growth promoters for meat-producing animals is strictly regulated within the European Union. However, in the past few years, a higher frequency of non-compliant bovine urine samples for prednisolone has been noticed, which could not be directly related to fraudulent use of prednisolone. As such, questions have risen about the origin of this compound. Unfortunately, at present, no decisive strategy has been established to discriminate between endogenous and exogenous prednisolone. In this study, an untargeted metabolomics strategy, based on Orbitrap and QqTOF mass spectrometry, was deployed to reveal urinary biomarkers, which are indicative for the exogenous administration of the synthetic glucocorticoid prednisolone. For this purpose, prednisolone was administered intramuscularly and per os to 12 bovines and a total of 2700 urine samples were collected before, during and after treatment. Multivariate statistical data analysis (i.e. OPLS-DA) revealed four differentiating metabolites that allowed discrimination between urine samples collected before and during prednisolone administration. None of these compounds were present in urine containing endogenous prednisolone, of which the formation was induced by the administration of a synthetic analogue of adrenocorticotropic hormone. Only one metabolite was retained as a highly suitable biomarker during growth-promoting and therapeutic prednisolone treatment, with 93.4 % sensitivity and 96.3 % specificity. Besides, this compound could be detected up to 4 days after a single therapeutic per os prednisolone administration. Based on accurate mass, isotope pattern, and MS/MS spectra, this compound was putatively annotated and is suggested as an actionable biomarker for exogenous prednisolone administration.",

                        "description": "Animals:</br>\nIn this study, a diverse group of cattle was compiled in order to include the potential influence of biological variation on the specific biomarker identification. More specifically, twelve healthy cows of a mixed breed, varying age (2\u20136 yrs) and with a body weight between 360 and 570 kg were housed for 8 months under controlled experimental conditions in the animal facilities of the Centre d\u2019Economie Rurale (CER) (Marloie, Belgium). The animals were fed a commercially available diet, commonly applied in zootechnical practice, with ad libitum access to water and hay. During the entire study, animals were kept in 3 separate groups (4 animals per group) and all housed in a half covered pen. Prior to the in vivo study, an initial acclimatization period of 14 days was considered. In order to consider animal growth during the in vivo study, the animals were weighted at the start and at the end of the experiment, but no significant differences were observed. The in vivo study was approved by CER\u2019s Ethical Committee (CE/Sante/ET/004).\n</p>\nExperimental protocol:</br>\nAfter the acclimatization period, which served as control, all animals underwent the same sequential prednisolone treatments: a growth-promoting treatment (long-term, 40 mg/cow/day) followed by a therapeutic treatment (short-term, 0.5 mg/kg b.w./day). The specific dosages were based on literature findings [1][2][3] to ensure relevant levels of prednisolone and potential metabolites in urine.\n</p>\nThe growth-promoting treatment started with 30 consecutive days of oral administration of 40 mg/day of prednisolone (Sigma-Aldrich St. Louis, USA) (Day + 1 till Day + 30) (PO1), followed by a washout period of 10 days (WO1). Next, intramuscular injections of 40 mg/day of Solu-Delta-Cortef (prednisolone sodium succinate, Zoetis, Zaventem, Belgie) were given for 30 consecutive days (Day + 41 till Day + 70) (IM1). Before the start of the therapeutic prednisolone treatment, a washout period of 35 days was considered (WO2).\n</p>\nDuring the therapeutic prednisolone treatment, a similar experimental set-up was implemented. First, the animals received 0.5 mg/kg b.w. of prednisolone per os for 5 days (Day + 106 till Day + 110) (PO2), which was followed by a washout period of 25 days (WO3). Next, intramuscular injections of 0.5 mg/kg b.w. of Solu-Delta-Cortef were administered during 5 consecutive days (Day + 136 till Day + 140) (IM2). A final washout period of 32 days (Day + 141 till Day + 172) was respected (WO4).\n</p>\nDuring the periods of oral administration, one capsule containing the appropriate amount of prednisolone, using lactose as excipient, was given in the morning just after feeding, using a capsule launcher. The intramuscular injections were placed in the neck and were alternated\nevery day from the left to the right side in order to minimize irritation.\n</p>\nCollection:</br>\nUrine samples were collected in the morning, 5 min before prednisolone administration, by a veterinarian using a probe (to prevent faecal contamination), immediately portioned into 15 ml tubes, and stored in the dark at -80 \u00b0C until analysis [4]. As for the sampling\nrate, during the acclimatization period, urine samples were collected daily. During the therapeutic and growth-promoting prednisolone treatments and washout periods, samples were collected every 5 days.\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Cannizzo, F.

                        "description": "In this study, the general workflow of data acquisition and analysis can be organized into multiple steps. A first step relates to the extraction of urine samples. Due to the large number of collected urine samples, sample preparation and analysis were performed in subsequent batches of four animals. The first batch considered of the urine samples of animals 1, 5, 7 and 12. The second batch contained the\nurine samples of animals 2, 4, 6 and 11, and the last batch included urine of animals 3, 8, 9 and 10. Instrumental stability (quality control measure) during mass spectrometric analyses was verified by considering standard injections. These injections were run at the beginning and repeated every 25 samples. This mixture consisted of cortisol, cortisone, dihydrocortisone, prednisolone, prednisone, methylprednisolone, 20alpha-dihydroprednisolone and 20beta-dihydroprednisolone. The following average coefficients of variance (n = 162) were obtained for the various glucocorticoids: 6.39% for cortisol, 5.51% for cortisone, 6.79% for dihydrocortisone, 3.09% for prednisolone, 4.35% for prednisone, 8.93% for methylprednisolone, 7.61% for 20alpha-dihydroprednisolone and 6.94% for 20beta-dihydroprednisolone.\n</p>\nThe second step involved data pre-processing (peak list generation), thereby using either Sieve 2.1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, USA) or MarkerViewTM 1.2.1.1 (SCIEX, California, USA) software, to respectively process Exactive (raw.files). Applied parameter values included an m/z-range of 150\u2013650 Da, a m/z width of 5 ppm, a retention time window ranging from 1 to 9.5 min, a peak intensity threshold of 100,000 arbitrary units, a maximum peak width of 0.5 min and a maximum number of 10,000 frames. Furthermore, corrections for inherent chromatographic variability along samples were made during the peak alignment process. This strategy rendered a list of features (detected ions) that were characterized by their m/z-value, retention time and signal abundance. The signal intensities of these ions were for each sample normalized by the average signal intensity of the two deuterium labeled internal standards i.e. cortisol-d4 and prednisolone-d8, which were supplemented prior to extraction. Moreover, since urine is a matrix subjected to potential dilution effects, a secondary normalization was implemented. normalization by means of specific gravity (Pocket Refractometer, Atago, Tokyo) based on the Levine\u2013Fahy\nequation (correction factor ranged from 1.003 to 1.0044) was implemented.\n</p>\nIn the final step, multivariate statistical analysis was performed by means of SIMCATM 13 software (Umetrics, Malmo, Sweden).",
