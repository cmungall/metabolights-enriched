                "description": "<p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is a curative procedure for a variety of conditions. Despite major advances, a plethora of adverse clinical outcomes can develop post-transplantation including graft-versus-host disease and infections, which remain the major causes of morbidity and mortality. There is increasing evidence that the gastrointestinal microbiota is associated with clinical outcomes post-hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Herein, we investigated the longitudinal dynamics of the gut microbiota and metabolome and potential associations to clinical outcomes in pediatric hematopoietic stem cell transplantation at a single centre.</p><p><strong>RESULTS:</strong> On admission (baseline), the majority of patients presented with a different gut microbial composition in comparison to healthy control children with a significantly lower alpha diversity. A further, marked decrease in alpha diversity was observed immediately post-transplantation and in most microbial diversity, and composition did not return to baseline status while hospitalized. Longitudinal trajectories identified continuous fluctuations in microbial composition, with the dominance of a single taxon in a significant proportion of patients. Using pam clustering, three clusters were observed in the dataset. Cluster 1 was common pre-transplantation, characterized by a higher abundance of <em>Clostridium XIVa</em>, <em>Bacteroides</em> and <em>Lachnospiraceae</em>; cluster 2 and cluster 3 were more common post-transplantation with higher abundance of <em>Streptococcus</em> and <em>Staphylococcus</em> in the former whilst <em>Enterococcus</em>, <em>Enterobacteriaceae</em> and <em>Escherichia</em> predominated in the latter. Cluster 3 was also associated with a higher risk of viraemia. Likewise, further multivariate analysis reveals <em>Enterobacteriaceae</em>, viraemia, use of total parenteral nutrition and various antimicrobials contributing towards cluster 3, <em>Streptococcaceae</em>, <em>Staphylococcaceae</em>, <em>Neisseriaceae</em>, vancomycin and metronidazole contributing towards cluster 2. <em>Lachnospiraceae</em>, <em>Ruminococcaceae</em>, <em>Bifidobacteriaceae</em> and not being on total parenteral nutrition contributed to cluster 1. Untargeted metabolomic analyses revealed changes that paralleled fluctuations in microbiota composition; importantly, low fecal butyrate was associated with higher risk of viraemia.</p><p><strong>CONCLUSIONS:</strong> These findings highlight the frequent shifts and dominations in the gut microbiota of pediatric patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The study reveals associations between the fecal microbiota, metabolome and viraemia. To identify and explore the potential of microbial biomarkers that may predict risk of complications post-HSCT, larger multi-centre studies investigating longitudinal microbial profiling in pediatric hematopoietic stem cell transplantation are warranted.</p>",

Preparative regimens were as follows: Reduced-intensity conditioning included treosulfan/fludarabine or fludarabine/melphalan or reduced-intensity busulfan/fludarabine (targeted busulfan area under the curve of 45 to 65 mg*h/L). Myeloablative protocols were: myeloablative busulfan/fludarabine (targeted busulfan area under the curve, &gt;70 mg*h/L) or treosulfan/fludarabine/thiotepa. GvHD grading (gut/skin) was done according to the Glucksberg criteria. Medication administrations, including antimicrobials, were also recorded. Prophylactic ciprofloxacin was administered from day -8/-10 until discharge or central venous line removal in younger patients. Viraemia was defined as a single positive detection of any virus (Epstein- Barr virus (EBV)/Cytomegalovirus (CMV)/Adenovirus/Human Herpesvirus 6 (HHV6) /Parvovirus) via PCR of a blood sample, regardless of viral load. CMV, Adenovirus and EBV were the most commonly detected in the cohort. Patients received both enteral and total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Further cohort characteristics are detailed in <strong>Table S1</strong> in the paper associated with this study.</p><p><br></p><p>In total 9 healthy controls were also studied. Healthy controls were not matched to the patients and consisted of stool samples from 5 females and 4 males with the median of 8 years (4-14), sampled once. Healthy controls did not receive antibiotics 6 months prior to sample collection. Upon receipt, all fecal samples were thoroughly mixed, aliquoted and frozen at -80 \u00b0C until required.</p>",

                        "description": "<p>The raw spectra were automatically baseline and phase corrected and calibrated to TSP using <strong>Topspin</strong> 3.2 (Bruker Biospin). The spectra were then imported into <strong>MATLAB</strong> (Version R2018b; Mathworks Inc., USA) and the redundant spectral regions (corresponding to water and TSP) were removed. Manual alignment to the median spectrum and to quality control spectra was performed using recursive segment-wise peak alignment. Finally, the spectra were normalized using a probabilistic quotient approach.</p><p><br></p><p>PCA was performed to summarize the overall variance in the dataset using whole spectra, whether metabolites were subsequently identified or not. Of the 439 samples, 14 outliers were identified and removed due to poor spectral quality. Orthogonal projection to latent structures (OPLS) and OPLS discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) methods were used to 246 identify biochemical variation related to continuous and categorical variables, respectively. Only models with positive Q2Y values, which are indicative of a model\u2019s predictive ability, were further tested for significance using permutation testing (1000 permutations, p-value threshold: p \u2264 0.05). To identify which metabolites significantly contributed to the model, p \u2264 0.05 was used as a cut-off for the calculated p-values of each peak (correlation of spectral feature to the predictive component of the model).</p><p><br></p><p>Several regions (potential drug residues) corresponding to 1.07-1.2 and 4.98-5.28 ppm were removed and the baseline model was re-run, however these regions did not influence the model (<strong>Figure S3</strong>). To investigate individual metabolites, peaks from the normalized spectra were integrated using trapezoidal numerical integration. Pearson correlation coefficient was used to correlate metabolite abundance and alpha diversity in baseline samples. Logistic regression was used to investigate associations between viraemia and metabolites in allogeneic HSCT baseline samples. The model including metabolites and patient demographic and clinical characteristics was subjected to stepwise reduction using the Akaike criterion. Following this, remaining metabolites were used as independent predictors alongside any significant baseline characteristics.</p>",
