                "description": "Brassicaceae plants contain glucosinolates, which are hydrolysed by myrosinases to toxic products such as isothiocyanates and nitriles, acting as defences. Herbivores have evolved various detoxification strategies, which are reviewed here. Larvae of Phaedon cochleariae (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) metabolise hydrolysis products of benzenic glucosinolates by conjugation with aspartic acid. In this study, we investigated whether P. cochleariae uses the same metabolic pathway for structurally different glucosinolates, whether the metabolism differs between adults and larvae and which hydrolysis products are formed as intermediates. Feeding experiments were performed with leaves of watercress (Nasturtium officinale, Brassicaceae) and pea (Pisum sativum, non-Brassicaceae), to which glucosinolates with structurally different side chains (benzenic, indole or aliphatic) or their hydrolysis products were applied. Samples were analysed by UHPLC-QTOF-MS/MS or TD-GC-MS. The same aspartic acid conjugates as previously identified in larvae were also detected as major metabolites of benzenic glucosinolates in adults. Indol-3-ylmethyl glucosinolate was mainly metabolised to N-(1H-indol-3-ylcarbonyl) glutamic acid in adults and larvae, while the metabolism of 2-propenyl glucosinolate remains unclear. The metabolism may thus proceed primarily via isothiocyanates rather than via nitriles, while the hydrolysis occurs independently of plant myrosinases. A detoxification by conjugation with these amino acids is not yet known from other Brassicaceae-feeders.",

Insects were fed with shoots of watercress. Plants of watercress (seeds from Volmary GmbH, M\u00fcnster, Germany) and pea (seeds from Kiepenkerl, Bruno Nebelung GmbH, Konken, Germany) used for the rearing and/or for feeding experiments (see below) were 6-8 wk old, not flowering and grown in a greenhouse (60% r.h., 16:8 h light:dark). The glucosinolate profile of these watercress plants was dominated by 2-phenylethyl glucosinolate (~89%), followed by 7-(methylsulfinyl)heptyl glucosinolate (~6%) and indol-3-ylmethyl glucosinolate as well as 8-(methylsulfinyl)octyl glucosinolate occurring in low amounts (~1% or less). The use of the plants in the present study complies with international, national and institutional guidelines.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Feeding bioassays with glucosinolates and hydrolysis products:</strong></p><p>The metabolism of structurally different glucosinolates was investigated by providing individuals of <em>P. cochleariae</em> with leaf discs (2 cm diameter) of either watercress or pea. Leaf discs were treated with solutions (50 \u03bcl, 40 mM) of either benzyl glucosinolate, 4-hydroxybenzyl glucosinolate, indol-3-ylmethyl glucosinolate or 2-propenyl glucosinolate (all &gt;95\u201399%, Phytoplan Diehm &amp; Neuberger GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany), dissolved each in a mixture of methanol (MeOH), millipore water (H2O) and dichloromethane (DCM) (64:30:6, v:v:v; organic solvents from Fisher Scientific, Loughborough, UK), or treated with the solvent only (as in<strong>[1]</strong>). Discs were kept for 40 min on moistened filter paper under a fume hood for solvent evaporation and then offered in Petri dishes (55 mm diameter) to <em>P. cochleariae</em>.</p><p><br></p><p>All mentioned glucosinolates were offered to adults (24 h after emergence), while experiments with larvae (5 h after moult to second instar) were performed with the 2 glucosinolates indol-3-ylmethyl glucosinolate and 2-propenyl glucosinolate only, because the larval metabolism of benzenic glucosinolates has already been investigated<strong>[1]</strong>. Individuals had been starved since their last moults. The treated leaf discs were offered to groups of 3 individuals for 24 h (watercress) or 48\u201372 h (pea) (6 replicates per plant species and test solution) to seek an uptake of at least 10%. Afterwards, from half of the groups individuals were dissected on ice into guts (<strong>\u201cgut\u201d</strong>) and remaining body tissues (<strong>\u201cbody\u201d</strong>). The remaining individuals were transferred into 2 ml Eppendorf tubes without food for 3 h to collect their faeces (<strong>\u201cfaeces\u201d</strong>), and individuals with emptied guts were collected separately (<strong>\u201cwhole\u201d</strong>). Thus, per treatment combination, 3 replicates pooled from 3 individuals were collected. In addition, leaf discs treated with the same glucosinolates or solvent but without insects were kept in Petri dishes for the same experimental period (n = 3 per treatment group and plant species). All insect samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen, stored at \u221280 \u00b0C and lyophilised. The freeze-dried samples were than extracted and measured by <strong>UHPLC-QTOF-MS/MS</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Friedrichs J, Schweiger R, Geisler S, Mix A, Wittstock U, M\u00fcller C.

Then, the <strong>Find Molecular Feature</strong> algorithm was used for picking of molecular features (each defined by a retention time and m/z), applying spectral background subtraction. Settings used for the algorithm were signal-to-noise threshold: 3, correlation coefficient threshold: 0.75, minimum compounds length: 16 spectra, smoothing width: 5. Molecular features probably belonging to the same metabolite were sorted together in so-called buckets, allowing the ion types [M-H]-, [M-H2O-H]-, [M+Cl]-, [M+HCOOH-H]-, [M+CH3COOH-H]-, [2M-H]-, [2M+HCOOH-H]-, [2M+CH3COOH-H]- and [3M-H]-. For alignments of buckets across the set of samples, shifts of 0.1 min (retention time) and 5 mDa (m/z) were allowed in the processing software <strong>Compass ProfileAnalysis 2.3</strong> (Bruker Daltonics). Within each bucket, the intensity (peak height) of the most intense molecular feature was used for quantification and divided by the height of the [M+HCOOH-H]- ion of hydrocortisone in the same sample. In the next step, fold changes were calculated for these features for each glucosinolate treatment as mean intensities in insect samples from the glucosinolate treatment divided by the mean intensities in insect samples from the solvent control treatment.</p>",
