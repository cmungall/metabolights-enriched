                "description": "It was recently demonstrated in mice that knockout of the flavin-containing monooxygenase 5 gene, Fmo5, slows metabolic ageing via pleiotropic effects. We have now used an NMR-based metabonomics approach to study the effects of ageing directly on the metabolic profiles of urine and plasma from male, wild-type C57BL/6J and Fmo5\u2212/\u2212 (FMO5 KO) mice back-crossed onto the C57BL/6J background. The aim of this study was to identify metabolic signatures that are associated with ageing in both these mouse lines and to characterize the age-related differences in the metabolite profiles between the FMO5 KO mice and their wild-type counterparts at equivalent time points. We identified a range of age-related biomarkers in both urine and plasma. Some metabolites, including urinary 6-hydroxy-6-methylheptan-3-one (6H6MH3O), a mouse sex pheromone, showed similar patterns of changes with age, regardless of genetic background. Others, however, were altered only in the FMO5 KO, or only in the wild-type mice, indicating the impact of genetic modifications on mouse ageing. Elevated concentrations of urinary taurine represent a distinctive, ageing-related change observed only in wild-type mice.",

FMO5 KO mice were obtained after 8 generations of backcrosses of heterozygous FMO5 KO mice with WT C57BL/6J mice[1]. WT C57BL/6J mice were used as controls. Mice were fed a standard chow diet (Teklad Global 18% Protein Rodent Diet, Harlan Laboratories, Inc., Madison, WI)[1]. Animal experiments were carried out in accordance with the UK Animal Procedures Act and with local ethics committee approval (Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Body).\n</p>\nTo study the metabolic effects of ageing, blood was collected from the tail vein into heparin-coated tubes and plasma isolated as described.[2] Urine samples were collected as described previously[3] from WT C57BL/6J and FMO5 KO mice, at the ages of 15 (n = 4, KO; n = 4, WT), 30 (n = 4, KO; n = 4, WT), 45 (n = 5, KO; n = 4, WT), and 60 (n = 4, KO; n = 4, WT) weeks. All samples were collected between 09:00 and 11:00 onto an ice-cooled surface and then frozen on solid CO2 and stored at 193 K until analysed by NMR spectroscopy.\n</p>\nThe week 15 and week 45 animals were from different cohorts and were each followed longitudinally for 15 weeks. To investigate the effect of batch differences[4] on the metabolic profiles of urine and plasma, a batch comparison experiment was performed on 2 different cohorts at the same week 30 time point (week 30 set 2, n = 5, KO; n = 5, WT, see Figures S1\u2013S4 in the paper associated with this study). Since no significant metabolic changes were found between different batches, using ANOVA[5] with a false discovery rate (FDR) set at 10%[6], we proceeded to study the longitudinal effects of ageing on the urinary and plasma metabolic profiles and to compare the profiles of WT and FMO5 KO mice.\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Gonzalez Malagon, S.

For each spectrum, 8 dummy scans were used to establish spin equilibrium, then 256 free induction decay transients were collected into 65,536 data points with a spectral width of 20 ppm.\n</p>\nFor all mouse plasma samples, 2 types of 1D 1H NMR experiments were acquired. The first was the standard 1D NOESY presaturation pulse sequence (noesygppr1d) with gradient pulses and saturation of the water peak during the relaxation delay (RD). After 8 dummy scans, 128 transients were collected into 65,536 data points over a spectral width of 20 ppm, using a relaxation delay (RD) of 2 s and a mixing time of 100 ms. Standard 1H NMR spectra provide information on both low- and high-molecular-mass metabolites. However, signals from low intensity, low-molecular-mass molecules can be obscured by broad signals arising from high-molecular-mass macromolecules. A second set of data was therefore acquired with the Carr\u2013Purcell\u2013Meiboom\u2013Gill (CPMG) spin-echo experiment, RD [90\u00b0x\u2013(t-180\u00b0y\u2013t)n\u2013collect FID], using the Bruker pulse sequence (cpmgpr), where RD = 2 s, the number of loops n = 100 and the spin-echo delay t = 400 \u00b5s, to allow spectral editing through T2 relaxation and therefore attenuation of broad signals. During the relaxation delay, irradiation was applied to achieve suppression of the water peak. For each spectrum, after 8 dummy scans, 128 transients were collected into 65,536 data points with a spectral width of 20 ppm and total spin\u2013spin relaxation delay (2n.t) of 80 ms.\n</p>\nTwo-dimensional (2D) NMR experiments[1] were carried out for selected urine and plasma samples to aid/confirm the assignment of metabolites. The detailed parameters for the acquisition of the 2D NMR spectra are provided in Tables S1, S2 in the paper associated with this study.\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Claridge, T. (2009).

Prior to applying Fourier transformation, the free induction decays (accumulated transients) were multiplied by an exponential function corresponding to a line broadening of 0.3 Hz. The 1D 1H NMR spectra were manually phased, baseline corrected and referenced to the chemical shift of TSP (0.0 ppm), for urine, and to the anomeric doublet of a-D-glucose at d 5.233, for plasma samples.\n</p>\nThe NMR data were then imported into Matlab (R2010 b, Mathworks) using in-house routines (MetaSpectra, Dr O. Cloarec, Imperial College) with a resolution of 0.00025 ppm. All subsequent data processing and analysis, unless stated otherwise, was carried out using in-house Matlab routines, written by Dr K. Veselkov's team as previously described and exemplified.[1][2] For urine samples, regions of the spectra upfield of 0.8 ppm, downfield of 10 ppm, and the spectral region containing water (d 4.7\u20134.9) were omitted to eliminate the effects of background noise and variable water saturation respectively.\n</p>\nFor the plasma NMR spectra, regions of the spectra downfield of 10 ppm and upfield of 0.8 ppm (CPMG) and 0.2 ppm (1D), as well as resonances corresponding to the water signal region (d 4.2\u20135.2, 1D) and (d 4.6\u20135.15, CPMG), were excluded.\n<p>\nAll NMR spectra were normalised using \u201cProbabilistic Quotient Normalization\u201d[3] in order to compensate for differences in concentration between samples. All 1H NMR spectra were then aligned using recursive segment-wise peak alignment (RSPA) method.[4] Alignment was performed in 2 steps: first, a global correction was carried out using the RSPA algorithm, and second, a custom interval approach was performed for signals that exhibited high chemical shift variation, like citrate and taurine, to align peak positions in baseline-separated regions defined by the researcher. All NMR spectra were also log-transformed to convert multiplicative noise into additive noise for downstream pattern recognition analysis.[1].\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Veselkov, K. A., Vingara, L.

A series of 2D NMR experiments, including J-resolved, correlation spectroscopy (COSY), TOCSY, HSQC, and HMBC (Claridge, 2009), were acquired for a number of samples in order to assist or confirm the identification of a range of metabolites. The identities of the key discriminating metabolites were also confirmed by the spiking of authentic standards into urine and plasma samples. Confidence in the identification of these known metabolites was assessed using the new metabolite identification carbon efficiency (MICE)[6] and topological MICE (tMICE)[7] methods.\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Dona, A.
