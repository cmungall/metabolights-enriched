                "description": "<p>The discovery of antibiotics has led to the effective treatment of bacterial infections that were otherwise fatal and has had a transformative effect on modern medicine. Teixobactin is an unusual depsipeptide natural product that was recently discovered from a previously unculturable soil bacterium which is active against several Gram-positive pathogens, including methicillin- resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococci. One of the key attractive features of teixobactin as an antibiotic lead is that resistance could not be generated in a laboratory setting against S. aureus. This is proposed to be a result of the mechanism of action that involves binding to essential bacterial cell wall synthesis building blocks lipid II and lipid III.</p><p>In the present study, metabolomics was used to investigate the potential metabolic pathways and mode of action involved in mechanisms of antibacterial activity and bacterial killing of the synthetic teixobactin analog Leu10-teixobactin against an MRSA strain, S. aureus ATCC700699. The metabolomes of S. aureus ATCC700699 cells were compared at 1, 3 and 6 h following treatment with Leu10-teixobactin (0.5 \u00b5g/ml, i.e. 0.5x MIC) and the untreated controls. Leu10-teixobactin significantly perturbed bacterial membrane lipids (glycerophospholipids and fatty acids), peptidoglycan (lipid I and II) metabolism and cell wall teichoic acid (lipid III) biosynthesis as early as after 1 h of treatment reflecting an initial activity on the cell envelope. Concordant with its time-dependent antibacterial killing action, Leu10-teixobactin caused more perturbations in the levels of key intermediates in pathways of amino-sugar and nucleotide-sugar metabolism and their downstream peptidoglycan and teichoic acid biosynthesis at 3 and 6 h. Significant perturbations in arginine metabolism and interrelated tricarboxylic acid cycle, histidine metabolism, pantothenate and Coenzyme A biosynthesis were also observed at 3 and 6 h.</p><p>To conclude, this is the first study to provide novel metabolomics mechanistic information which lends to support the development of teixobactin as an antibacterial drug for the treatment of multi-drug resistant Gram-positive infections.</p>",

Overnight culture was prepared by inoculating few colonies into 100 ml MHB in 250 ml conical flasks (Pyrex) and incubated in an incubator shaker (Bioline) at 37 \u00b0C and 180 rpm for 16 h. After overnight incubation, the log phase was prepared in fresh MHB and then incubated for 2 h at 37 \u00b0C and 180 rpm to log phase with a starting bacterial inoculum of 108 CFU/ml. Stock solution of Leu10-teixobactin prepared beforehand was then added to a flask to give a desired concentration of 0.5 \u03bcg/ml leaving another flask as an antibiotic-free control for each replicate. The flasks were then further incubated at 37 \u00b0C with shaking at 180 rpm. At each time point, 15 ml samples were transferred to 50 ml Falcon tubes (Thermo Fisher, Australia) for quenching and then the optical density reading at 600 nm (OD600) was measured and normalized to approximately 0.5 with fresh MHB. Samples were then centrifuged at 3220 \u00d7 g at 4 \u02daC for 10 min and the supernatants were removed subsequently.

Two LC solvents, 20 mM ammonium carbonate (solvent A) and acetonitrile (solvent B), were used, which operated via a multistep gradient system. The gradient started at 80% solvent B, which declined to 50% solvent B over 15 min and was then reduced from 50% solvent B to 5% solvent B over 3 min, followed by a wash with 5% solvent B for another 3 min and, finally, an 8 min re-equilibration with 80% solvent B at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. The injection sample volume was 10 \u00b5l, and the total run time was 32 min. All samples were analyzed as a single LC-MS batch to avoid batch-to-batch variation. Mixtures of pure standards containing over 300 metabolites were also included in the analysis batch to aid in metabolite identification.</p>",
