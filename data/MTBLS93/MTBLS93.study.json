                "description": "The TwinGene project, conducted between 2004 and 2008, is a population-based Swedish study of twins born between 1911 and 1958. The study participants have previously participated in a telephone interview called Screening Across the Lifespan Twin Study, conducted between 1998 and 2002. To be included in TwinGene, both twins within a pair had to be alive. In total, 12591 individuals participated by donating blood to the study, and by answering questionnaires about life style and health. For the purpose of metabolomic profiling, we designed a case-cohort of incident coronary heart disease, diabetes, dementia and ischemic stroke events and a matched sub-cohort (controls) stratified on age and sex. In the final analysis we included serum samples from 2,139 individuals.",

TwinGene is a longitudinal study nested within the Swedish Twin Register initiated to examine associations between genetic factors and cardiovascular disease in Swedish twins. Twins born before 1958 and who has participated in a telephone screening between 1998 and 2002 were re-contacted between April 2004 and December 2008. Health and medication data were collected from self-reported questionnaires, and a blood sampling kit was mailed to the subject who then contacted a local health care center for blood sampling and a health check-up. Contacts were allowed on Monday to Thursday mornings (not the day before a national holiday), to ensure that the sample would reach the KI Biobank in Stockholm the following day by over night mail. The participants were instructed to fast from 8 PM (20:00) the previous night. A total volume of 50 ml of blood was drawn from each individual by venipuncture.\n</p>\nFirst, a tube containing Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) was filled and inverted 5 times immediately. These plasma samples were used for DNA extraction. Second, three gel tubes were filled, inverted 5 times immediately, let stand for 30 min for coagulation at room temperature, centrifuge for 10-15 min at 3800 rpm. Thus, the serum was tapped from the gel tubes to a collection tube and placed in a transport cylinder. These serum samples were used for storage and for the following metabolomics analysis. Serum samples for biochemical analysis were collected in the same way. Tubes were sent to Karolinska University Laboratory by overnight post where they were frozen at -80 \u00b0C in liquid nitrogen until analysis.\n</p>\nIn total, 12,591 individuals (55% women) participated by donating blood to the study, and by answering questionnaires about life style and health. Metabolomics was performed in a subsample of TwinGene. Specifically, we utilized a case-cohort design by selecting all the incident cases of coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes, ischemic strokes and dementia up to 31st December 2010 and a sub-cohort (controls) of 1,643 individuals (43% women). The subcohort was stratified on median age and sex, and for each of the four strata, we randomly selected a number of participants proportional to the corresponding number of cases. In total, 2,139 individuals had metabolomic profiling data available.\n</p>\nRef: </br>\n[1] Magnusson PK, Almqvist C, Rahman I, Ganna A, Viktorin A, Walum H, Halldner L et.al.

Procedures to perform non-targeted metabolomics in large-population studies have been previously described by our group [2]; the code has been made publically available at https://github.com/andgan/metabolomics_pipeline. Metabolic feature detection, alignment, grouping, imputation and normalization were performed separately for each study. Each feature is characterized by a specific mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) and retention time. A single metabolite is normally represented by more than one feature. Indiscriminant (id) MS and idMS/MS spectra were generated for all the significant features [3]. Those with highly similar spectra, strong correlation and similar retention time were deemed to be from the same metabolite. We used the spectra to identify the corresponding metabolite. Four approaches were considered, in agreement with what has been suggested by the Metabolomics Standard Initiative [4].\n</p>\nNormalization:</br>\nFirst, feature intensities were transformed to the log2 base scale to approximate normal distribution. Second, potential sample outliers were identified by plotting the total intensity for each sample. Samples with extremes total intensities might indicate sample degradation or technical errors and these samples were excluded.  Third, an ANOVA-type normalization was used to take into account factors of unwanted variation. Specifically, we fitted a linear regression for association between each feature intensity and several factors of unwanted variability. We then used the residuals from the regression as new feature intensities. The factors of unwanted variability can be identified by studying the association between several technical variables and the first principal components. In TwinGene we adjusted for the square root of the sum of the squared differences between original retention time and corrected retention time, analysis date, storage time and unknown cluster effect. Finally, feature intensities were averaged between technical duplicates to reduce the inherent instrumental variability. Features with poor correlation between duplicates were excluded.\n</p>\nRef: </br>\n[1] Smith CA, Want EJ, O\u2019Maille G, Abagyan R, Siuzdak G (2006) XCMS: processing mass spectrometry data for metabolite profiling using nonlinear peak alignment, matching, and identification.
