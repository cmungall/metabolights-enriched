                "description": "<p><strong>INTRODUCTION: </strong>Earliness of tuberisation and the quality of potato tubers are important traits in potato breeding. The qualitative traits rely on the metabolite profile of tubers, which are storage organs and net importers of assimilates. Thus, the quality of tubers largely depends on the metabolites transported from leaves to developing tubers.</p><p><strong>OBJECTIVES: </strong>To test the influence of canopy on the quality of tubers by metabolite profiling of tubers of an early- and a late-maturing potato line and their grafts.</p><p><strong>METHODS:</strong> Potatoes were grown under greenhouse conditions, grafted and the tubers harvested at the end of the scions' vegetation period. Metabolite profiling of freshly harvested tubers was performed using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. Statistical analyses were applied to determine the significant differences between the different tubers.</p><p><strong>RESULTS:</strong> 99 metabolites were identified and an additional 181 peaks detected in chromatograms, out of which 186 were polar and 94 non-polar compounds. The concentrations of 113 metabolites were significantly different in the tubers from the early-maturing CE3130 and the late-maturing CE3027 line. Hetero-grafting resulted in considerable changes in the metabolite content of tubers. Especially, the effect of CE3027 on the metabolite composition of tubers formed on CE3130 rootstocks was readily apparent. Nevertheless, many compounds were present at similar levels in the tubers of hetero-grafted plants as was found in the tubers of their scion counterparts.</p><p><strong>CONCLUSION:</strong> Hetero-grafting resulted in many compounds at similar concentrations in rootstock tubers as in scion tubers suggesting that these are transported from the source leaves to tubers.</p>",

Plant growth conditions were previously described<strong>[1]</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Grafting and morphological studies:</strong></p><p>Grafting of plants was carried out 2 wk after planting the in vitro plantlets into pots. Stems of the plants serving as scions and rootstocks were cut at approximately 2 cm above the soil with a diagonal cut. The scions were placed on rootstocks and wrapped with rubber clips. The grafted plants were incubated under high humidity in a glassy box in shadow in the greenhouse. After a week, the grafted plants were transferred into larger pots with a 14 cm diameter top and 14 cm depth and grown further under ambient light (12-15 h light/12-9 h dark) at a temperature regime of 20-26 \u00b0C with regular watering. 2 consecutive grafting experiments were carried out. In the first experiment the tuber formation was tested by carefully tipping out the plants off the pots together with the soil and re-planting them after counting the tubers. This experiment was carried out with 5-5 non-grafted control, 5-5 homo-grafted and 15-15 hetero-grafted plants. In the second experiment, 20-20 non-grafted, 30-30 homo-grafted and 30-30 hetero-grafted plants were used. From both experiments, tubers were harvested at the end of the vegetation period of the scions and visually evaluated for shape and colour.</p><p><br></p><p>5 biological replications per combination were collected for metabolite studies.
