                "description": "Extreme environmental conditions at high altitude, such as hypobaric hypoxia, low temperature, and strong UV radiation, pose a great challenge to the survival of animals. Although the mechanisms of adaptation to high-altitude environments have attracted much attention for native plateau species, the underlying metabolic regulation remains unclear. Here, we used a multi-platform metabolomic analysis to compare metabolic profiles of liver between high- and low-altitude populations of toad-headed lizards, Phrynocephalus vlangalii, from the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. A total of 191 differential metabolites were identified, consisting of 108 up-regulated and 83 down-regulated metabolites in high-altitude lizards as compared with values for low-altitude lizards. Pathway analysis revealed that the significantly different metabolites were associated with carbohydrate metabolism, amino acid metabolism, purine metabolism, and glycerolipid metabolism. Most intermediary metabolites of glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle were not significantly altered between the two altitudes, but most free fatty acids as well as \u03b2-hydroxybutyric acid were significantly lower in the high-altitude population. This may suggest that high-altitude lizards rely more on carbohydrates as their main energy fuel rather than lipids. Higher levels of phospholipids occurred in the liver of high-altitude populations, suggesting that membrane lipids may undergo adaptive remodeling in response to low-temperature stress at high altitude. In summary, this study demonstrates that metabolic profiles differ substantially between high- and low-altitude lizard populations, and that these differential metabolites and metabolic pathways can provide new insights to reveal mechanisms of adaptation to extreme environments at high altitude.",

Liver samples (50 mg, n = 10 for each group) were mixed with 1000 \u03bcL of extraction reagent (methanol:acetonitrile:water, 2:2:1; v:v:v) containing adonitol (1000:5; v:v) and then quickly homogenized using an automatic homogenizer (JXFSTPRP-24, Shanghai Jingxin Technology Co., Ltd, Shanghai, China) followed by ultrasound-treatment for 5 min (repeated 3 times) with an ultrasonic apparatus (PS-60AL, Leidebang Electronics Co., Ltd., Shenzhen, China) while samples were held in ice water. Samples were then left to stand at -40 \u00b0C for 1 h and finally centrifuged at 13,800 x g for 15 min at 4 \u00b0C. For subsequent ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography coupled with Q-Exactive MS (UHPLC-QE-MS) analysis, supernatants were removed and quality control (QC) samples (n = 5) were prepared by mixing equal aliquot (10 \u03bcL) of supernatants from all samples. For gas chromatography coupled with a time-of-flight mass spectrometer (GC-TOF-MS) analysis, aliquots of 200 \u03bcL of the supernatant from each sample were transferred to new EP tubes, as well as preparing QC samples (n = 5) by mixing an equal aliquot (40 \u03bcL) of supernatants from all of the samples. After freeze-drying, all samples were mixed with 40 \u03bcL of methoxyamination hydrochloride (dissolved in 20 mg/mL pyridine) and incubated at 80 \u00b0C for 30 min. Then, N,O-Bis (trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) with 1% trimethylchorosilane (TMCS) was added and incubated at 70 \u00b0C for 1.5 h. Finally, 5 \u03bcL of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs, dissolved in chloroform) was added to QC sample, and then all samples were analyzed by GC-TOF-MS.</p>",
