                "description": "<p>Excessive salt intake is a widespread health issue observed in almost every country around the world. A high salt diet (HSD) has a strong correlation with numerous diseases, including hypertension, chronic kidney disease and autoimmune disorders. However, the mechanisms underlying HSD-promotion of inflammation and exacerbation of these diseases are not fully understood. In this study, we observed that HSD consumption reduced the abundance of the gut microbial metabolite L-fucose, leading to a more substantial inflammatory response in mice. A HSD led to increased peritonitis incidence in mice, as evidenced by the increased accumulation of inflammatory cells and elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and MCP-1, in peritoneal lavage fluid. Following the administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics, HSD-induced inflammation was abolished, indicating that the proinflammatory effects of HSD were not due to the direct effect of sodium, but rather to HSD-induced alterations in the composition of the gut microbiota. By using untargeted metabolomics techniques, we determined that the levels of the gut microbial metabolite L-fucose were reduced by a HSD. Moreover, the administration of L-fucose or fucoidan, a compound derived from brown that is rich in L-fucose, normalized the level of inflammation in mice following HSD induction. In addition, both L-fucose and fucoidan inhibited LPS-induced macrophage activation <em>in vitro</em>. In summary, our research showed that reduced L-fucose levels in the gut contributed contributes to HSD-exacerbated acute inflammation in mice; these results indicate that L-fucose and fucoidan could interfere with HSD-promotion of the inflammatory response.</p>",
