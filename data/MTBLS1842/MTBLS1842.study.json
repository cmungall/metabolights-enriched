                "description": "<p>Despite the growing popularity of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomics, no study has yet to systematically compare the performance of different data acquisition modes in the discovery of significantly altered metabolic features, which is an important task of untargeted metabolomics for identifying clinical biomarkers and elucidating disease mechanism in comparative samples. In this work, we performed a comprehensive comparison of three most commonly used data acquisition modes, including full-scan, data-dependent acquisition (DDA), and data-independent acquisition (DIA), using a metabolomics study of human plasma samples from leukemia patients before and after one-month chemotherapy. After optimization of data processing parameters, we extracted and compared statistically significant metabolic features from the results of each data acquisition mode. We found that most significant features can be consistently found in all three data acquisition modes with similar statistical performance as evaluated by Pearson correlation and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Upon comparison, DDA mode consistently generated fewer uniquely found significant features than full-scan and DIA modes. We then manually inspected over 2000 uniquely discovered significant features in each data acquisition mode and showed that these features can be generally categorized into four major types. Many significant features were missed in DDA mode, primarily due to its low capability of detecting or extracting these features from raw LC-MS data. We thus proposed a bioinformatic solution to rescue these missing significant features from the raw DDA data with good reproducibility and accuracy. Overall, our work asserts that data acquisition modes can influence metabolomics results, suggesting room for improvement of data acquisition modes for untargeted metabolomics.</p>",

In brief, 50 \u00b5l of the biofluid was mixed with 270 \u00b5l ice-cold methanol to quench metabolic activities and placed in a&nbsp;20 \u00b0C freezer overnight to complete the protein precipitation process. Then, 900 \u00b5l methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) was mixed with the extracted solution and vortexed for 30 min on a microplate shaker. To induce phase separation, 265 \u00b5l H2O was then added into the solution, followed by centrifugation (17,530 x g, 4 \u00b0C, 1 min). The upper organic phase and lower aqueous phase were separately transferred to 2 x 1.5 ml Eppendorf vials and concentrated by SpeedVac at 4 \u00b0C. The concentrated pellets were subsequently reconstituted with (ACN:IPA=1:1, v:v) for the lipids from organic phase and (ACN:H2O=1:1, v:v) for the metabolites from aqueous phase. 1 method blank was prepared using the same procedure but with no real sample in the vial. The metabolite solutions of BMIF samples were used for HILIC(-) analysis and the lipid solutions of PB samples were used for RP(+) analysis.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Wang S, Zhou L, Wang Z, Shi X, Xu G.

RP(+) and HILIC(-) modes were used in this study as they are the 2 most commonly used LC-MS modes for profiling hydrophobic and hydrophilic metabolites, respectively. A Millipore ZIC-pHILIC column (2.1 x 150 mm, 5 \u00b5m particle size, 200 \u00c5) was used for HILIC(-) analysis. A Waters ACQUITY UPLC BEH C18 column (1.0 x 100 mm, 1.7 \u00b5m particle size, 130 \u00c5) was used for RP(+) analysis. For HILIC(-) analysis, mobile phase A was 95% H2O and 5% ACN (adjusted to pH = 9.8 with 5 mM ammonium acetate (NH4AC)); mobile phase B was 5% H2O and 95% ACN. The chromatographic gradient was set as follows: 0 min, 5% A; 20 min, 80% A; 25 min, 95% A; 26 min, 5% A. Post-gradient equilibrium time was set for 14 min at 5% A. Flow rate was 0.15 ml/min. For RP(+) analysis, mobile phase A was 60% ACN and 40% H2O (adjusted to pH = 2.6 with 2 mM ammonium formate (NH4FA)); mobile phase B was 90% IPA and 10% ACN (adjusted to pH = 2.6 with 2 mM NH4FA). The chromatographic gradient was set as follows: 0 min,95% A; 8 min, 60% A; 14 min, 30% A; 20 min, 5% A; 23 min, 5% A; 24 min, 95% A. Post-gradient equilibrium time was set for 9 min at 95% A. Flow rate was 0.10 ml/min. A 2 \u00b5l of 250 mM sodium formate (NaFA) injection was performed at the end of each LC gradient as the internal reference. The analyses of full-scan, DDA, and DIA were completely randomized to minimize signal drift and systematic bias.</p>",
