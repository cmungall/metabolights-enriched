                "description": "In the ocean surface layer and cell culture, the polyamine transport protein PotD of SAR11 bacteria is often one of the most abundant proteins detected. Polyamines are organic cations at seawater pH produced by all living organisms and are thought to be an important component of dissolved organic matter (DOM) produced in planktonic ecosystems. We hypothesized that SAR11 cells uptake and metabolize multiple polyamines and use them as sources of carbon and nitrogen. Metabolic footprinting and fingerprinting were used to measure the uptake of five polyamine compounds (putrescine, cadaverine, agmatine, norspermidine, and spermidine) in two SAR11 strains that represent the majority of SAR11 cells in the surface ocean environment, Ca. Pelagibacter st. HTCC7211 and C. P. ubique st. HTCC1062. Both strains took up all five polyamines and concentrated them to micromolar or millimolar intracellular concentrations. Both strains could use most of the polyamines to meet their nitrogen requirements, but polyamines did not fully substitute for their requirements of glycine (or related compounds) or pyruvate (or related compounds). Our data suggests that potABCD transports all five polyamines and that spermidine synthase, speE, is reversible, catalyzing the breakdown of spermidine and norspermidine, in addition to its usual biosynthetic role. These findings provide support for the hypothesis that enzyme multifunctionality enables streamlined cells in planktonic ecosystems to increase the range of DOM compounds they metabolize.",

                        "description": "<p><strong>SAR11 Growth and Washing </strong></p><p>The protocol for <strong>SAR11 </strong>growth conditions, cell counts, and washing has been previously reported<strong>[1]</strong>. Briefly, <strong>Candidatus Pelagibacter sp. HTCC7211</strong> and <strong>Ca. P. ubique HTCC1062</strong> were grown on artificial seawater (ASW) amended with 100 \u00b5M pyruvate, 50 \u00b5M glycine, 10 \u00b5M methionine, and SAR11-specific vitamins at either 25 or 16 \u02daC (HTCC7211 and HTCC1062, respectively) in 12 h light/dark<strong>[2][3]</strong>. For testing <strong>polyamines </strong>as a nitrogen (N) source, a modified ASW was used without inorganic N (ammonium sulfate). This modified ASW was amended with 100 \u00b5M pyruvate, 50 \u00b5M oxaloacetate (instead of glycine), 1 \u00b5M dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP; instead of methionine), and vitamins, since both glycine and methionine provide potential organic N sources<strong>[4]</strong>. In the growth experiments testing polyamines as a N source, there were two positive controls: a <strong>N-replete positive control</strong>, with 400 \u00b5M ammonium sulfate added, and an <strong>equimolar N positive control</strong>, containing the same stoichiometric ammonium sulfate concentration as the experimental cultures with organic N sources (<strong>polyamines</strong>). For growth experiments, cell counts were taken at least twice a week and growth rates and maximum cell densities calculated as described previously<strong>[2]</strong>. For growth experiments, a starting cell density of 1E^5 cells/mL was used; a density of 5E^4 cells/mL was used in experiments using the modified ASW, as cells grew to a lower maximum cell density in this medium. For the experiments testing <strong>polyamines </strong>as a N source, cultures were started from cultures grown without N to late exponential phase to exhaust any carryover N. For footprinting/fingerprinting experiments, cells were harvested using centrifugation (Beckman-Coulter J2-21) at 10\u02daC at 30,000 g for 90 min. Cell pellets were re-suspended in TE buffer and pelleted again (Beckman-Coulter Ultracentrifuge) at 12\u02daC at 48,000 g for 60 minutes<strong>[1]</strong>. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Footprinting and Fingerprinting Experiments </strong></p><p>To measure the identity and quantity of polyamine compounds used by <strong>SAR11 cells</strong>, a panel of 5 common <strong>polyamine </strong>compounds was added to <strong>SAR11 </strong>cultures at the beginning of growth under normal growth conditions. The <strong>polyamine </strong>compounds used were <strong>putrescine </strong>(PUT), <strong>cadaverine </strong>(CAD), <strong>agmatine </strong>(AGM), <strong>norspermidine </strong>(NSD), and <strong>spermidine </strong>(SPD). Each <strong>polyamine </strong>compound was added at a final concentration of 500 nM for HTCC1062 or 250 nM for HTCC7211. 250 nM was used for HTCC7211 as they were found to be inhibited in growth at 500 nM (<strong>Figure S1 (A-B) </strong> in the paper associated with this study). Concentrations used were about 100X ambient <strong>polyamine </strong>concentrations for several reasons: to allow for accurate quantification of <strong>polyamines</strong>; to match the high densities of cells used, which were also about 100X average cell densities in the ocean; and to match previous amendment studies with <strong>polyamines </strong>and other, similar compounds<strong>[5]-[7]</strong>. A <strong>negative control </strong>treatment with SAR11 cells but no <strong>polyamines </strong>added was used to measure native <strong>polyamine </strong>production and background <strong>polyamine </strong>concentrations in the ASW. A <strong>no-cell control</strong> with <strong>polyamines </strong>and <strong>no SAR11 cells</strong> was also included to account for degradation of <strong>polyamines</strong>, extraction efficiency during SPE, and carryover <strong>polyamines </strong>in the intracellular measurements. All treatments were done in quadruplicate. Samples were taken for cell counts twice a week; samples for <strong>extracellular </strong>(footprint) and <strong>intracellular </strong>(fingerprint) polyamine measurements were taken in late exponential phase. The metabolic pathways of two of the <strong>polyamine </strong>compounds, SPD and NSD, are not clear in<strong> SAR11 cells</strong>. Thus, further fingerprinting experiments were carried out with SPD and NSD added separately to cultures at 500 nM. Several possible metabolic intermediates and byproducts were measured in these cells and compared to a <strong>negative control </strong>with no <strong>polyamines </strong>added.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1] </strong>Noell SE, Giovannoni SJ.

Cells were pelleted and washed in TE Buffer as described above. The supernatant was then completely removed and the cell pellet was re-suspended in 10 \u00b5L of fresh TE buffer. Volume was determined via an analytical balance. 1 \u00b5L of re-suspended cells was removed and diluted 1:200 in TE buffer to determine cellular abundance for per-cell normalization. Cells were lysed by adding 100 \u00b5L of cold methanol (MeOH; LC-MS grade) to the cell suspension, followed by an addition of 300 \u00b5L of cold 1 M acetic acid<strong>[1]</strong>. Cell lysis and polyamine extraction was completed by shaking samples on high for 5 min followed by rest in ice for 1 min to avoid overheating, repeated 3 times. A liquid phase extraction was used to remove hydrophobic components of the cellular matrix: 400 \u00b5L of chloroform (LC-MS grade) was added and the samples shaken for 1 min, followed by centrifugation for 5 min at 5,000 RPM to achieve phase separation. The aqueous layer containing the polyamines was transferred into a new tube and the organic layer discarded. The resulting sample was concentrated via drying under a nitrogen stream at 30 \u02daC. The dried samples were re-suspended in 30 \u00b5L of 50:50 1 M acetic acid:acetonitrile<strong>[2]</strong>, weighed, and analyzed as described below. When 125 nM standards of each compound were extracted using this method, minimal degradation was observed, with over 60% recovery (<strong>Table S1</strong> in the paper associated with this study). Because no intracellular polyamine standard reference exists, reported intracellular measurements in this paper were not corrected for recovery efficiency.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Extracellular SPE Extraction </strong></p><p>Polyamines dissolved in the culture media were extracted using a solid phase extraction (SPE) as described previously<strong>[2]</strong>. 10 mL of the supernatant from the initial centrifugation of cultures (described above) was used for each sample. Polyamines were extracted via gravity alone (nominal flow rate of 0.07 mL/min) onto a 1000 mg Bond Elut-C18 SPE column (3 mL, Agilent) pre-conditioned with methanol and bicarbonate buffer at pH 12. Salts were removed from the column by washing 3 times with 1 mL of 0.1 M borate buffer, pH 12. Polyamines were eluted into cryovials with three washes of equal volumes of 1 M acetic acid and acetonitrile, final volume 5 mL. Greater than 85% recovery for CAD, PUT, NSD, and SPD was observed, while AGM had 48% recovery (<strong>Table S1 </strong>in the paper associated with this study), perhaps because of the high pKa of AGM (~12) compared to the other four compounds (~10). Artificial seawater (blanks) extracted using this method only had minimal concentrations (less than 4 nM) of NSD and SPD and none of the other three compounds. Measured concentrations were not corrected for extraction recovery and so values reported in this paper are conservative.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1] </strong>Longnecker K, Kido Soule MC, Kujawinski EB. 2015.
