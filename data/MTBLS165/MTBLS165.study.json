                "description": "Ursids (bears) in general, and giant pandas in particular, are highly altricial at birth. The components of bear milks and their changes with time may be uniquely adapted to nourish relatively immature neonates, protect them from pathogens, and support the maturation of neonatal digestive physiology. Serial milk samples collected from three giant pandas in early lactation were subjected to untargeted metabolite profiling and multivariate analysis. Changes in milk metabolites with time after birth were analysed by Principal Component Analysis, Hierarchical Cluster Analysis and further supported by Orthogonal Partial Least Square-Discriminant Analysis, revealing three phases of milk maturation: days 1\u20136 (Phase 1), days 7\u201320 (Phase 2), and beyond day 20 (Phase 3). While the compositions of Phase 1 milks were essentially indistinguishable among individuals, divergences emerged during the second week of lactation. OPLS regression analysis positioned against the growth rate of one cub tentatively inferred a correlation with changes in the abundance of a trisaccharide, isoglobotriose, previously observed to be a major oligosaccharide in ursid milks. Three artificial milk formulae used to feed giant panda cubs were also analysed, and were found to differ markedly in component content from natural panda milk. These findings have implications for the dependence of the ontogeny of all species of bears, and potentially other members of the Carnivora and beyond, on the complexity and sequential changes in maternal provision of micrometabolites in the immediate period after birth.",

In the total of 55 milk samples, 17 were collected from \u201cLi Li\u201d, 21 from \u201cYuan Yuan\u201d and 17 from \u201cXiao Ya Tou\u201d respectively. The collection dates and postpartum days with the information of individual panda mothers are detailed in Supplementary Material Table 1 (SM-T1). The samples were frozen within 2 hrs of collection and kept at -80 \u00b0C until analysis. Infant formula (Enfamil) was purchased from Mead Johnson Company, LIC (No.2011503, Indiana USA). Dog milk replacer (Esbilac formula) was obtained from PetAg, New Hampshire, IL (No.IL-BLD-OO4, Illinois USA) and Panda milk replacer (research use only) was obtained from Morinyu Sunworld Co., Ltd (No. 141-0031, Tokyo Japan).",

The LC and the MS conditions were same as used in our previous studies [1][2]. The samples were put into a random sequence for LC-MS analysis and the QC sample (YY-19day) was injected at the beginning, the middle and the end of the experiment respectively to monitor the stability of the instrumentation. The elution gradient was performed by decreasing the percentage of acetonitrile from 80% to 20% in 30 min followed by washing the column at 5% of acetonitrile for 5 min and finally re-equilibrating the column at 80% of B for 10 min. Flow rate was 0.3 ml/min.\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Zhang T, Creek DJ, Barrett MP, Blackburn G, Watson DG (2012) Evaluation of coupling reversed phase, aqueous normal phase, and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography with Orbitrap mass spectrometry for metabolomic studies of human urine.

                        "description": "The ESI interface was operated in a positive/negative polarity switching mode. The spray voltage was 4.5 kV for positive mode and 4.0 kV for negative mode. The temperature of the ion transfer capillary was 275 \u00b0C and sheath and auxiliary gas was 50 and 17 arbitrary units respectively. The full scan range was 75 to 1200 m/z for both positive and negative modes with settings of AGC target and resolution as Balanced and High (1e6 and 50,000) respectively. The data was recorded using Xcalibur 2.1.0 software package (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Mass calibration was performed for both ESI polarities before the analysis using the standard Thermo Calmix solution with addition of some additional compounds to cover the low mass range and the signals of 83.0604 m/z (2 x ACN+H) and 91.0037 m/z (2 x formate-H) were selected as lock masses for positive and negative mode respectively during each analytical run. For HCD-on experiments the collision energy was 25 eV for both ESI positive and negative modes.",

MS2 and MS3 fragmentation of the key components discovered in the multivariate analysis was carried out by using Collision Induced Dissociation (CID) at 35 V using a Surveyor HPLC system combined with a LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometer from Thermo Fisher Scientific UK. The  MS/MS spectra obtained were compared with the published data or interpreted for further identification (SM-T2).\n</p>\nSIMCA-P version 13.0 (Umetrics, Sweden) was used for multivariate analysis including PCA, HCA, OPLS-DA and OPLS. The data was centred and unit variance (UV) scaled for PCA and HCA but Pareto (Par) scaled for OPLS-DA and OPLS in order to generate an S-plot for visualisation of the components with significant influence in the dataset. The rate of increase in the weight of the giant panda baby was used as the single Y-variable in OPLS. It was calculated as the percentage increase in body weight in relation to the whole body weight on the previous day (SM-T3).\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Zhang T, Creek DJ, Barrett MP, Blackburn G, Watson DG (2012) Evaluation of coupling reversed phase, aqueous normal phase, and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography with Orbitrap mass spectrometry for metabolomic studies of human urine.
