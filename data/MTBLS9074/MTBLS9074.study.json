                "description": "Articular cartilage degeneration, which may lead to osteoarthritis (OA), is a normal component of the aging process, but its underlying mechanism remains unknown. We found that chondrocytes exhibited an energy metabolism shift from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) during aging. Reprogrammed cartilage metabolism by parkin ablation decreased OXPHOS and increased glycolysis, with ameliorated aging-related OA. Metabolomics analysis indicated that lauroyl-L-carnitine (LLC) was decreased in aged cartilage, but increased in parkin-deficient cartilage. In vitro, LLC improved the cartilage matrix synthesis of OA chondrocytes. In vivo, intraarticular injection of LLC in mice with anterior cruciate ligament transaction (ACLT) ameliorated OA. These results suggest that metabolic changes are regulated by parkin-impaired cartilage during aging, and targeting the metabolomic changes by supplementation with LLC is a promising treatment strategy for ameliorating OA.",

All mice had ad libitum access to food and water and were maintained in an SPF facility with a 12 h:12 h light:dark cycle. Littermate of male mice was used for <strong>age-related OA model</strong> of <strong>wildtype</strong> and <strong>Prkn-KO</strong> mice.</p><p><br></p><p>The mouse knee OA model was induced by anterior cruciate ligament transaction (ACLT). Briefly, after anesthesia with isoflurane inhalation, the anterior cruciate ligament of the right knee was transected, while sham operation was performed without ligament transection. 10 wk-old male mice were randomly assigned to sham and ACLT operated groups. For LLC treatment, mice were given an intra-articular injection of 10\u00b5l LLC (300\u00b5M) or vehicle using micro syringe. The injection was repeated twice a wk for 4 consecutive wks. Mice were euthanized for tissue harvesting by carbon dioxide asphyxiation 4 wks after operation. All experiments were carried out under the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Shanghai Sixth People\u2019s Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University and were performed with IACUC-approved protocols.</p>",

LC\u2212MS raw data files were converted into mzXML format and then processed by the XCMS, CAMERA and metaX toolbox implemented with the R software. Each ion was identified by combining retention time (RT) and m/z data. Intensities of each peaks were recorded and a three dimensional matrix containing arbitrarily assigned peak indices (retention time-m/z pairs), sample names (observations) and ion intensity information (variables) was generated. The online KEGG, HMDB database was used to annotate the metabolites by matching the exact molecular mass data (m/z) of samples with those from database. If a mass difference between observed and the database value was less than 10 ppm, the metabolite would be annotated and the molecular formula of metabolites would further be identified and validated by the isotopic distribution measurements. We also used a in-house fragment spectrum library of metabolites to validate the metabolite identidification.</p>",

PCA was performed for outlier detection and batch effects evaluation using the pre-processed dataset. Quality control-based robust LOESS signal correction was fitted to the QC data with respect to the order of injection to minimize signal intensity drift over time.
