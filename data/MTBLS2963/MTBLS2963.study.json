                "description": "<p><strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong> Paratuberculosis, commonly known as Johne\u2019s disease, is a chronic intestinal infection of ruminants caused by <em>Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis</em> (MAP). Clinical signs, including reduced milk yields, weight loss and diarrhoea, are typically absent until 2 to 6 years post exposure.</p><p><strong>OBJECTIVES:</strong> To identify metabolomic changes profiles of MAP challenged Holstein-Friesian cattle and correlate identified metabolites to haematological and immunological parameters.</p><p><strong>METHODS:</strong> At approximately 6 weeks of age, calves (n = 9) were challenged with 3.8 x 10^9 cells of MAP (clinical isolate CIT003) on 2 consecutive days. Additional unchallenged calves (n = 9) formed the control group. The study used biobanked serum from cattle sampled periodically from 3- to 33-months post challenge. The assessment of sera using flow infusion electrospray high resolution mass spectrometry (FIE-HRMS) for high throughput, sensitive, non-targeted metabolite fingerprinting highlighted differences in metabolite levels between the two groups.</p><p><strong>RESULTS:</strong> In total, 25 metabolites which were differentially accumulated in MAP challenged cattle were identified, including 20 which could be correlated with certain haematological parameters, particularly monocyte levels.</p><p><strong>CONCLUSION: </strong>The targeted metabolites suggest shifts in amino acid metabolism that could reflect immune system activation linked to MAP and as well as differences in phosphocholine levels which could reflect activation of the Th1 (tending towards pro-inflammatory) immune response. If verified by future work, selected metabolites could be used as biomarkers to diagnose and manage MAP infected cattle.</p>",

All dams were MAP fecal culture negative and seronegative. Calves were housed indoors at the Central Veterinary Research Laboratory Farm (County Kildare, Ireland) for the duration of the study. To minimise cross contamination, the 2 groups were housed approximately 0.5 km apart and strict biosecurity measures enforced.</p><p><br></p><p>Calves were randomly assigned to the MAP challenge (n = 35) or control (n = 20) group. At approximately 6 weeks of age, the challenge group received an inoculation with 3.8 x 10^9 MAP bacterial cells (clinical isolate CIT003) on 2 consecutive days. Faecal MAP culture tests were performed at 3-, 6-, 9-, 12-, 16-, 20-, 24-, 28-, 31- and 33-months post challenge. Tissue culture was conducted upon euthanasia at either 12-, 24- or 33-months post challenge. Pathological evaluations assessed the ileum and ileocaecal value, as well as the ileal and ileocaecal lymph nodes, for changes consistent with MAP infection. The cell mediated immune (CMI) response was assessed 2-, 3-, 6-, 10-, 12-, 16-, 20-, 24-, 28-, 31- and 33-months post challenge using the Bovigam IFN\u0263 release assay (IGRA) (Prionics AG, Schlieren-Zurich, Switzerland). Blood samples were collected in EDTA tubes and measured for a range of haematology parameters, including monocytes (% and x 10^9/L).</p>",
