                "description": "<p>Optimal handling is the most important means to ensure adequate sample quality. We aimed to investigate whether pre-centrifugation delay time and temperature could be accurately predicted and to what extent variability induced by pre-centrifugation management can be adjusted for. We used untargeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) metabolomics to predict and evaluate the influence of pre-centrifugation temperature and delayed time on plasma samples. Pre-centrifugation temperature (4, 25 and 37&nbsp;\u00b0C; classification rate 87%) and time (5\u2013210&nbsp;min; Q2&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.82) were accurately predicted using Random Forest (RF). Metabolites uniquely reflecting temperature and temperature-time interactions were discovered using a combination of RF and generalized linear models. Time-related metabolite profiles suggested a perturbed stability of the metabolome at all temperatures in the investigated time period (5\u2013210&nbsp;min), and the variation at 4&nbsp;\u00b0C was observed in particular before 90&nbsp;min. A total of 14 and 8 metabolites were selected and validated for accurate prediction of pre-centrifugation temperature (classification rate 94%) and delay time (Q2&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.90), respectively. In summary, the metabolite profile was rapidly affected by pre-centrifugation delay at all temperatures and thus the pre-centrifugation delay should be as short as possible for metabolomics analysis. The metabolite panels provided accurate predictions of pre-centrifugation delay time and temperature in healthy individuals in a separate validation sample. Such predictions could potentially be useful for assessing legacy samples where relevant metadata is lacking. However, validation in larger populations and different phenotypes, including disease states, is needed.</p>",

Plasma samples were then stored at&nbsp;-80&nbsp;\u00b0C until instrumental analysis. This study was approved by the Regional Ethics Review Board in Gothenburg (Ethics number 054-15).</p><p><br></p><p>For the injection sequence, a 3-level constrained randomization procedure was applied between individuals, between temperatures within individuals and lastly between delay times within temperatures. All samples from the same donor were analysed in the same batch. Study-specific quality control samples (sQCs) were prepared by pooling equal amount of plasma from each sample and subjecting the mixture to the same sample preparation procedure as the actual samples<strong>[1]</strong>. Injection of sQCs was performed at the beginning, at the end and evenly between every 11 samples throughout the batch sequence. Long-term quality control plasma samples (ltQCs) from an independent population were used as part of the platform quality control system to monitor the performance of instrument and to provide reference for within- and between-batch data normalization<strong>[2]</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Broadhurst D, Goodacre R, Reinke SN, Kuligowski J, Wilson ID, Lewis MR, Dunn WB.

Data from reversed-phase positive (RP) and negative (RN) modes were processed separately using the R package \u201c<strong>XCMS</strong>\u201d<strong>[1]</strong>. Key parameters were optimized with the aid of the R package \u201c<strong>IPO</strong>\u201d<strong>[2]</strong>. In total, 3485 metabolite features (i.e., a mass spectral peak with a unique mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) and retention time (RT)) were obtained for RN and 3676 features for RP. Missing values were imputed using an in-house Random Forest (RF) based algorithm - the <strong>mvImpWrap()</strong> function (<a href='https://gitlab.com/CarlBrunius/StatTools' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>https://gitlab.com/CarlBrunius/StatTools</a>). To adjust for systematic intensity drifts of features, within- and between-batch normalization were performed using support vector regression and the R package \u201c<strong>MetNormalizer</strong>\u201d<strong>[3]</strong>. After normalization, 2946 features for RN and 2824 features for RP that had coefficient of variation (CV)&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;30% among sQCs were retained. Subsequently, features presumably derived from a single metabolite were grouped (R package \u201c<strong>RAMClustR</strong>\u201d<strong>[4]</strong> using manually optimized parameters), which resulted in 3172 metabolite features in total for statistical analysis. The term \u201cmetabolite feature\u201d and \u201cmetabolite\u201d were both used in this work where \u201cmetabolite\u201d specifically refers to the chemical compound after annotation and \u201cmetabolite feature\u201d refer to a LC-MS signal characterized by m/z and RT.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Prediction and evaluation of the effects of pre-centrifugation temperature and delay time on plasma metabolome:</strong></p><p>The analysis workflow detailing the number of metabolite features and/or metabolites at various stages is shown in the <strong>Supplemental Information </strong>in the paper associated with this study. A Random Forest (RF) algorithm with unbiased variable selection in a repeated double cross-validation (rdCV)<strong>[5]</strong> scheme (R package \u201c<strong>MUVR</strong>\u201d<strong>[6]</strong>) was used to model the effects of pre-centrifugation management conditions on the plasma metabolome. Each model resulted in both \u201cMin\u201d and \u201cMax\u201d variable selections for temperature and time, respectively. These variable selections provide similar predictions and correspond to the minimal-optimal set of most robust predictors (\u201cMin\u201d) and all-relevant variables within the modelling scheme (\u201cMax\u201d)<strong>[6]</strong>. More detailed description and application of the algorithm can be found in the publication by Shi and colleagues<strong>[6]</strong>. The minimal-optimal strategy was applied to select robust and parsimonious subsets of metabolite features<strong>[6]</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p>Specifically, RF classification analysis was performed for pre-centrifugation temperatures (4, 25 or 37&nbsp;\u00b0C), whereas RF regression was performed for modelling of natural logarithmic (log) transformed pre-centrifugation delay time (as a continuous variable ranging from 0 to 223&nbsp;min). To evaluate modelling fitness and predictability, percentage of correctly classified samples (i.e. classification rate) and Q2 (i.e. prediction power, also known as R2CV) were used for classification and regression analyses, respectively.</p><p><br></p><p>We selected all the metabolite features associated with pre-centrifugation temperature and delay time prediction (i.e. the \u201cMax\u201d selection). These features were then analysed one-by-one using generalized linear models (GLM) to investigate the effects of pre-centrifugation temperature, delay time (as a categorical variable, with four levels 5, 90, 150 and 210&nbsp;min) and their interaction, adjusted for donors\u2019 coded identity, fasting status, age and gender (R package \u201c<strong>GLM</strong>\u201d). Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was used to evaluate the effect of pre-centrifugation temperature, delay time and their interaction on metabolite features. P-values from F-test were adjusted for multiple testings using the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) method. Estimated marginal means (EMMEANS, R package \u201c<strong>emmeans</strong>\u201d) were used for pairwise comparisons of metabolite features uniquely associated with temperature or the temperature-time interaction at FDR &lt;0.05 and p values were adjusted by the Tukey method.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Clustering and correction of metabolome intensity drift induced by pre-centrifugation delay time:</strong></p><p>The change in metabolome over pre-centrifugation delay time was investigated by first scaling feature intensities per feature and individual by root mean square and then averaging over the individuals per time point. Metabolite features where the reproducibility of the drift between individuals had CV &gt; 30% were removed. Features with similar drift pattern were grouped into clusters and the cluster time profiles were then modelled separately for each temperature using cubic spline regression and the R package \u201c<strong>sample Drift</strong>\u201d<strong>[7]</strong>. Correction of feature intensities was then achieved by cluster-wise normalization from the actual pre-centrifugation time to the reference time point (5&nbsp;min).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Selection of predictive metabolite panels for pre-centrifugation temperature and delay time:</strong></p><p>The construction of predictive panels was performed separately for pre-centrifugation temperature and delay time. Metabolites for these panels were selected directly from the minimal-optimal variable selection of the MUVR-RF algorithm (i.e. the \u201cMin\u201d selection) as described previously<strong>[6]</strong>. Then, RF modelling within a rdCV<strong>[5]</strong> scheme using the R package \u201c<strong>rdCV</strong>\u201d (<a href='https://gitlab.com/CarlBrunius/rdCV' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>https://gitlab.com/CarlBrunius/rdCV</a>) in a backward step-wise elimination manner was used to further narrow down the number of metabolite features.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Metabolite annotation:</strong></p><p>Annotation of metabolite feature was performed by matching accurate mass and mass fragmentation patterns (MS/MS) against online libraries (<strong>HMDB</strong>, <strong>Metlin</strong> and <strong>MoNA</strong>) with 10&nbsp;ppm accuracy. The 4 levels of metabolite identification from the Metabolomics Standard Initiative (MSI)<strong>[8]</strong> were applied. For metabolites that had no hits in the online libraries, <strong>SIRIUS[9]</strong> was used to facilitate putative metabolite annotation.
