                "description": "The impact of combined heat and drought stress was investigated in Arabidopsis thaliana and compared to individual stresses to reveal additive effects and interactions. A combination of plant metabolomics and root and rhizosphere bacterial metabarcoding were used to unravel effects at the plant holobiont level. Hierarchical cluster analysis of metabolomics signatures pointed out two main clusters, one including heat and combined heat and drought, and the second cluster that included the control and drought treatments. Overall, phenylpropanoids and nitrogen-containing compounds, hormones and amino acids showed the highest discriminant potential. A decrease in alpha diversity was observed upon stress, with stress-dependent differences in bacterial microbiota composition. The shift in beta-diversity highlighted the pivotal enrichment of Proteobacteria, including Rhizobiales, Enterobacteriales and Azospirillales. The results corroborate the concept of stress interaction, where the combined heat and drought stress is not the mere combination of the single stresses. Intriguingly, multi-omics interpretations evidenced a good correlation between root metabolomics and root bacterial microbiota, indicating an orchestrated modulation of the whole holobiont.",

(2004) with some modifications. A professional potting soil (Orticole alveolo TecnoGrow, Tercomposti, Calvisano BS, Italy) was sterilised before the experiment (120 \u00b0C for 20 min). Before sowing, seed germination was synchronised by soaking the seeds in sterile water for 76 hours at 4 \u00b0C in dark conditions. Ten seeds were then sown per pot, and after germination, they were thinned, leaving one seedling per pot. A total of 24 pots (5 x 5 x 5 cm) were prepared for each treatment and replicate.</p><p><br></p><p>Seedlings were grown in a growth chamber under controlled conditions:&nbsp;12 h light / 12 h dark photoperiod (long day), 21\u00b11 \u00b0C, 100 \u00b5mol m-2&nbsp;s-1, and relative humidity of 60-70%. Seedlings were fertilised every other day through sub-irrigation using a half-strength Hoagland solution and grown for 22 days [Arabidopsis growth stage 3.50, Rosette is ~ 50% final size&nbsp;(Boyes et al., 2001).&nbsp;The following treatments were applied: C (Control watered plants), D (Drought stress), H (heat stress), and D+H (Drought + Heat stress). Drought treatment was achieved by blocking plant irrigation until they reached a relative water content&nbsp;(RWC) of 65 % to 70 % (typically 5\u20136 d). In contrast, heat stress was applied by raising the temperature gradually (~ 4 \u00b0C per hour) to avoid heat shock, in the growth chamber to 35 \u00b0C, and then keeping the plants at this temperature for 12 h. At the end of the experiments, 1 g of the rhizosphere and root samples were collected for the microbiome analysis. Roots were carefully washed in sterilised distilled water and immediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Both soil and powdered roots were stored at -80 \u00b0C&nbsp;(Thijs et al., 2017).</p>",

The univariate analysis of morphological and physiological parameters was carried out using XLSTAT 2014.5.03. Data were analysed through one-way ANOVA using Duncan\u2019s test as post hoc (P \u2264 0.05).</p><p>Concerning metabolomics, the post-acquisition data analysis was carried out using the software Mass Profiler Professional 12.6 (Agilent Technologies); the compounds were log2 transformed, normalised at the 75th percentile, and baselined against the median. Afterwards, both unsupervised and supervised multivariate statistics were applied for interpretations. According to Euclidean distance and Ward's linkage, the unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis was used to underline the relatedness across the different treatments. In addition, the supervised orthogonal projection to latent structures discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) was carried out, and the model parameter (goodness-of-fit R2Y and goodness-of-prediction Q2Y) were recorded. Also, the OPLS-DA model was cross-validated (CV-ANOVA), inspected for outliers (Hotelling\u2019s T2), and the overfitting was excluded through a permutation test (n = 200). Then, the Variable Importance in Projection (VIP) analysis was used to select the metabolites having the highest discriminant potential (VIP score &gt; 1.2). Finally, the differential compounds obtained from the ANOVA and fold-change analysis (FC) ( p &lt; 0.05, Bonferroni multiple testing correction and Fold-Change FC \u2265 2) were exported into the Omic Viewer Pathway Tool of PlantCyc&nbsp;(Plant Metabolic Network)&nbsp;(Stanford, CA, USA) software for interpretation&nbsp;(Karp et al., 2009; Caspi et al., 2013)</p>",
