                "description": "Background: Worldwide, over 350 million people are chronically infected with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) and are at increased risk of developing progressive liver diseases. The confinement of HBV replication to the liver, which also acts as the central hub for metabolic and nutritional regulation, emphasizes the interlinked nature of host metabolism and the disease. Still, the metabolic processes operational during the distinct clinical phases of a chronic HBV infection\u2014immune tolerant, immune active, inactive carrier, and HBeAg-negative hepatitis phases\u2014remains unexplored. </p> Methods: To investigate this, we conducted a targeted metabolomics approach on serum to determine the metabolic progression over the clinical phases of chronic HBV infection, using patient samples grouped based on their HBV DNA, alanine aminotransferase, and HBeAg serum levels. </p> Results: Our data illustrate the strength of metabolomics to provide insight into the metabolic dysregulation experienced during chronic HBV. The immune tolerant phase is characterized by the speculated viral hijacking of the glycerol-3-phosphate\u2013NADH shuttle, explaining the reduced glycerophospholipid and increased plasmalogen species, indicating a strong link to HBV replication. The persisting impairment of the choline glycerophospholipids, even during the inactive carrier phase with minimal HBV activity, alludes to possible metabolic imprinting effects. The progression of chronic HBV is associated with increased concentrations of very long chain triglycerides together with citrulline and ornithine, reflective of a dysregulated urea cycle peaking in the HBV envelope antigen-negative phase. </p> Conclusions: The work presented here will aid in future studies to (i) validate and understand the implication of these metabolic changes using a thorough systems biology approach, (ii) monitor and predict disease severity, as well as (iii) determine the therapeutic value of the glycerol-3-phosphate\u2013NADH shuttle. </p> The Lipid assays and the Biogenic amine and Acyl-carnitine assays for this study can be found in the MetaboLights studies MTBLS279 and MTBLS280 respectively.",

Blood was prospectively collected in SST tubes at the Erasmus MC and centrifuged to separate the serum and stored at -80 \u00b0C until analysis. Patients were treatment na\u00efve and excluded if they had other chronic infections (HIV, hepatitis C virus) or a body mass index of 31 or more. This study was conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki and the principles of Good Clinical Practice. The ethical review board of the Erasmus MC approved the study and informed consent was obtained from all patients who were asked to donate blood.\n</p>\nDefinition of chronic HBV clinical phases:</br>\nSerum ALT was measured on an automated analyzer, qualitative serum HBV surface antigen (HBsAg), HBeAg, and anti-HBeAg antibodies (Abs) were measured on an Architect Abbott analyzer, and serum HBV DNA levels were measured using the COBAS AmpliPrep-COBAS Taq- Man HBVv2test (CAP-CTM; Roche Molecular Systems, Indianapolis, IN). Based on serum HBV DNA, ALT levels and HBeAg presence at the time of sampling, patients were categorized into four clinical HBV phases according to international guidelines[1]. Immune tolerant (IT, n=18) patients had detectable serum HBeAg and repetitive normal ALT values (<40 U/l). The HBeAg-positive immune active (IA, n=12) and HBeAg-negative (ENEG, n=19) patients had repetitive or intermittent abnormal serum ALT (>40 U/l) values, and HBV DNA levels >2,000 IU/ml. Inactive carrier (IC, n=20) patients were HBeAg-negative and had both repetitive normal ALT values (<40 IU/l) and HBV DNAllevels below 20,000 IU/ml.</br>\nNote: A Unit (U)/litre(l) (SI unit) is equivalent to an International (IU)/litre(l) (US unit)[2]\n</p>\nQuality control samples:</br>\nQuality control (QC) samples consisted of equally pooled volumes of all study samples. A set of QC samples was then included during the analyses of the experimental groups on the individual metabolomic platforms and evenly distributed through the randomized samples prior to liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (LC\u2013MS) analyses. In addition, independent duplicate samples (10\u201315%) were randomly selected where sample volume allowed.\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] European Association For The Study Of The, 2012 no.259 (Table 2)</br>\n[2] SI to US units conversion.pdf, included with this study.</br>",
