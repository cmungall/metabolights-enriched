                "description": "BACKGROUND: Plants respond to various stress stimuli by activating an enhanced broad-spectrum defensive ability. The development of novel resistance inducers represents an attractive, alternative crop protection strategy. In this regard, hexanoic acid (Hxa, a chemical elicitor) and azelaic acid (Aza, a natural signaling compound) have been proposed as inducers of plant defense, by means of a priming mechanism. Here, we investigated both the mode of action and the complementarity of Aza and Hxa as priming agents in Nicotiana tabacum cells in support of enhanced defense. </br> RESULTS: Metabolomic analyses identified signatory biomarkers involved in the establishment of a pre-conditioned state following Aza and Hxa treatment. Both inducers affected the metabolomes in a similar manner and generated common biomarkers: caffeoylputrescine glycoside, cis-5-caffeoylquinic acid, feruloylglycoside, feruloyl-3-methoxytyramine glycoside and feruloyl-3-methoxytyramine conjugate. Subsequently, quantitative real time-PCR was used to investigate the expression of inducible defense response genes: phenylalanine ammonia lyase, hydroxycinnamoyl CoA quinate transferase and hydroxycinnamoyl transferase to monitor activation of the early phenylpropanoid pathway and chlorogenic acids metabolism, while ethylene response element-binding protein, small sar1 GTPase, heat shock protein 90, RAR1, SGT1, non-expressor of PR genes 1 and thioredoxin were analyzed to report on signal transduction events. Pathogenesis-related protein 1a and defensin were quantified to investigate the activation of defenses regulated by salicylic acid and jasmonic acid respectively. The qPCR results revealed differential expression kinetics and, in general (except for NPR1, Thionin and PR1a), the relative gene expression ratios observed in the Hxa-treated cells were significantly greater than the expression observed in the cells treated with Aza. </br> CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that Aza and Hxa have a similar priming effect through activation of genes involved in the establishment of systemic acquired resistance, associated with enhanced synthesis of hydroxycinnamic acids and related conjugates.",

                        "description": "Nicotiana tabacum cv Samsun cell cultures[1][2] were established from callus derived from sterile, in vitro grown tobacco plants grown from seeds (Agriculture Research Council, Roodeplaat, South Africa). For callus induction, stem and leaf sections were placed on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium containing 0.25 mg/l 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and 0.25 mg/l kinetin (pH 5.8). Cell suspensions were grown in liquid MS medium with the same hormone composition, whilst continuously shaking at 120 rpm in the dark at 25 \u00b0C[3-5]. Cells were sub-cultured into fresh medium every 7 d. All of the experiments were conducted 2\u20133 d after sub-culturing, during the logarithmic stage [6].\n</p>\nEach experiment was conducted a minimum of 3 times in order to generate the required minimum number of biological replicates required for metabolomics analyses [7-9]. Cell suspensions, as described above, were treated with equimolar concentrations of Aza and Hxa (final concentrations of 100 \u03bcM) (Sigma Aldrich, Germany). The 2 inducers were prepared as 10 mM stock solutions, dissolved in MS medium and with the pH adjusted to 5.8 [10]. Na\u00efve (non-treated / non-stimulated cells) exhibited no changes over the 24 h time period and served as a negative controls. Cells were harvested at the selected time points (0, 6, 12 and 24 h) by filtration onto 55 mm circle filter papers using a vacuum filtration system (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). The cells were transferred into Falcon tubes and cold, sterile MS medium (without any vitamins, hormones and inducing agents) was added to 50 ml to wash the cells free of any original culture medium. Thereafter, the cells were filtered again as described, weighed and processed for extraction.\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Djami-Tchatchou AT, Maake MP, Piater LA, Dubery IA.

The suspensions were homogenized using a probe sonicator (Bandelin Sonopuls, Berlin, Germany) set at 55% power for 15 s with 4 cycles. The homogenates were centrifuged at 5100 x g for 15 min at room temperature and the supernatants concentrated to approximately 1 ml on a rotary evaporator set at 50 \u00b0C. The resulting volumes were transferred into 2 ml Eppendorf tubes and dried to completeness in a heating block set at 50 \u00b0C overnight. The dried residues were reconstituted in 500 \u03bcl 50% (v/v) UHPLC-grade methanol (Romil Chemistry, Cambridge, UK) in autoclaved milli-Q water, and filtered through a 0.22 \u03bcm nylon syringe filter into 300 \u03bcl inserts fitted into glass vials with slitted caps. The filtrates were stored at \u221220 \u00b0C until analysis. To ensure reproducibility and account for analytical variability, the obtained results were from 3 independent biological repeats, each analyzed in triplicate (i.e. 3 technical repeats) for all samples. During data acquisition, pooled samples were used for quality control (QC) checks. Sample acquisition was randomized and the QC sample analyzed every 10 injections to monitor and correct changes in the instrument response.",

The binary solvents utilized consisted of UHPLC grade water (eluent A) and acetonitrile (eluent B) (Romil Pure Chemistry, Cambridge, UK), both containing 0.1% formic acid. The initial conditions were 5% A and gradient elution was introduced to change the chromatographic conditions to 90% B at 16 min and the conditions were kept constant for 1 min; the gradient was then dropped to the initial conditions and held for 2 min. The flow rate was 0.4 ml/min whilst an injection volume of 3 \u03bcl was used. Separated analytes were detected using a photodiode array detector; scanning range from 200 to 500 nm with 1.2 nm resolution and a sampling rate of 20 points/s.",

The MarkerLynxTM data matrix (of Rt-m/z variable pairs, with the m/z peak intensities for each sample), was exported to the SIMCA (Soft Independent Modeling of Class Analogy) software, version 14 (Umetrics, Ume\u00e5, Sweden) for principal component analysis (PCA) using Pareto scaling and orthogonal projection to latent structures discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) modeling also using Pareto scaling.",
