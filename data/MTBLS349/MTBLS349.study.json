                "description": "Introduction: The analysis of post-mortem metabolomic changes in biological fluids opens the way to develop new methods for the estimation of post-mortem interval (PMI). It may also help in the analysis of disease-induced metabolomic changes in human tissues when the postoperational samples are compared to the post-mortem samples from healthy donors. Objectives: The goals of this study are to observe and classify the post-mortem changes occurring in the rabbit blood, aqueous and vitreous humors (AH and VH), to identify the potential PMI markers among a wide range of metabolites, and also to determine which biological fluid \u2013 blood, AH or VH \u2013 is more suitable for the PMI estimation. Methods: The quantitative metabolomic profiling of samples of the rabbit serum, AH and VH taken at different PMIs has been performed with the combined use of high-frequency NMR and high-resolution LC-MS methods. Results: The quantitative levels of 63 metabolites in the rabbit serum, AH and VH at different PMIs have been measured. It has been found that the post-mortem metabolomic changes in AH and VH proceed slower than in blood, and the data scattering is lower. Among the metabolites whose concentrations increase with time, the most significant and linear growth is found for hypoxanthine, choline and glycerol. Conclusion: The obtained results indicate the advantage of ocular fluids, AH and VH, over blood serum for the search of potential biochemical markers for the PMI estimation. Among the compounds studied in the present work, hypoxanthine, choline and glycerol give the biggest promise as the potential PMI biomarkers.",

The animals were treated according to the ARVO Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research and the European Union Directive 2010/63/EU on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes, with the ethics clearance from the International Tomography Center SB RAS. Animals were sacrificed by electrical stunning. The bodies of 3 rabbits were kept at room temperature (24-25 \u00b0C) for 31 hr.\n</p>\nThe ante-mortem blood samples were obtained right before the rabbit culling by venepuncture from the marginal ear vein. The post-mortem samples of aqueous humor (AH), vitreous humor (VH) and blood were collected immediately after death (5-10 min post-mortem) and 1, 2, 4, 6, 10, 14, and 23 hr thereafter. 1 more blood sample from each animal was taken 31 hr post-mortem. The post-mortem blood samples (volume 0.4-1.0 ml) were taken by the direct cardiopuncture using the syringe with the thick needle (22G); the samples of AH (0.05-0.12 ml) were taken from the anterior chamber by the cornea puncture with the thin needle (27G), and the samples of VH (0.09-0.12 ml) \u2013 by the sclera puncture (in the ora serrata area) with the thick needle (18G). The first 4 samples of AH and VH (10 min, 1, 2, and 4 hr) were taken from 1 eye of each animal, and the second 4 samples \u2013 from the other. The collected blood samples were immediately centrifuged (3,000 x g, 10 min), and the plasma obtained was transferred into separate vials. The fluid samples (plasma, AH, VH) were immediately frozen and stored at -70 \u00b0C.",
