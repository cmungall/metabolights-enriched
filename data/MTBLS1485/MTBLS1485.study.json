                "description": "<p><strong>BACKGROUND: </strong>Kava is an important neuroactive medicinal plant. While kava has a large global consumer footprint for its clinical and recreational use, factors related to its use lack standardization and the tissue-specific metabolite profile of its neuroactive constituents is not well understood.</p><p><strong>RESULTS: </strong>Here we characterized the metabolomic profile and spatio-temporal characteristics of tissues from the roots and stems using cross-platform metabolomics and a 3D imaging approach. Gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry revealed the highest content of kavalactones in crown root peels and lateral roots. Infrared matrix-assisted laser desorption electrospray ionization (IR-MALDESI) imaging revealed a unique tissue-specific presence of each target kavalactone. X-ray micro-computed tomography analysis demonstrated that lateral roots have morphological characteristics suitable for synthesis of the highest content of kavalactones.</p><p><strong>CONCLUSIONS: </strong>These results provide mechanistic insights into the social and clinical practice of the use of only peeled roots by linking specific tissue characteristics to concentrations of neuroactive compounds.</p>",

The samples were &gt;3 years of maturity and provided as gift samples from Haridaya Enterprises Ltd., Fiji. Approximately 6 kg of the root samples were collected, with 3 samples each for selected parts of the plant. Crown roots peels (CRP), crown roots with no peels (CNP), crown roots with peels (CWP), lateral roots (LR), stem peels (SP), stems with no peels (SNP) and stems with peels (SWP) were the tissues selected for analysis. At the time of harvest the stump portion was left attached to the root.</p>",
