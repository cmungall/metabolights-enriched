                "description": "<p>Ferroptosis is mediated by lipid peroxidation of phospholipids containing polyunsaturated fatty acyl moieties. Glutathione, the key cellular antioxidant capable of inhibiting lipid peroxidation via the activity of the enzyme glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX-4), is generated directly from the sulfur-containing amino acid cysteine, and indirectly from methionine via the transsulfuration pathway. Herein we show that cysteine and methionine deprivation (CMD) can synergize with the GPX4 inhibitor RSL3 to increase ferroptotic cell death and lipid peroxidation in both murine and human glioma cell lines and in <em>ex vivo</em> organotypic slice cultures. We also show that a cysteine-depleted, methionine-restricted diet can improve therapeutic response to RSL3 and prolong survival in a syngeneic orthotopic murine glioma model. Finally, this CMD diet leads to profound <em>in vivo</em> metabolomic, proteomic and lipidomic alterations, highlighting the potential for improving the efficacy of ferroptotic therapies in glioma treatment with a non-invasive dietary modification.</p>",

                        "description": "<p><strong>Ethics Statement</strong></p><p>All experimental procedures involving mice were reviewed and approved by the Columbia University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Procedures involving de-identified human surgical specimens were conducted following Columbia University Irving Medical Center Institutional Review Board approval.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Cell lines and culture conditions </strong></p><p>Murine glioma cell lines were generated from retrovirus induced orthotopic murine glioma models as previously described<strong>[1]</strong>. Briefly, C57Bl/6 neonatal (p4) mice harboring floxed p53 and stop-flox mCherry-luciferase were anesthetized using hypothermia and orthotopically injected with a PDGFA - internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) - cyclization recombination (Cre) retrovirus (stereotaxic coordinates relative to bregma: 1 mm anterior, 1 mm lateral, 1 mm deep), resulting in tumor cells that overexpress PDGFA and mCherry-Luciferase, and have deleted p53<strong>[2]</strong>. End-stage tumors were harvested and tumor cells isolated and cultured in basal media (BFP), containing DMEM (Gibco 11965092) with 0.5% FBS (Gibco 16000044), antibiotic-antimycotic (Thermo Scientific 15240096), N2 supplement (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 17502-048), and 10 ng/mL each of recombinant human PDGF-AA (Peprotech, 100-13A) and FGFb (Peprotech, 10018B50UG). Three biological replicates of PDGFA driven cells made from three independent tumors with the same genetic background were used for this study. A Pten-/- P53-/- PDGFB+ cell line was also used<strong>[1]</strong>. All cells were grown at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2. For all murine glioma cell lines cysteine methionine deprived media was made from basal DMEM without cysteine, methionine and glutamine (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 21013024) that was supplemented with L-glutamine to a final concentration of 4mM. All other components of the media were the same for control and CMD media. Human glioma cells were cultured as previously described<strong>[3][4]</strong>. TS543 cell neurosphere cell lines were cultured in Neurocult media as previously described<strong>[3]</strong>, but were dissociated and plated in a single cell monolayer in 96 well plates in either BFP or cysteine methionine deprived BFP for dose response experiments. KNS42 cell lines were cultured in DMEM+10%FBS or cysteine methionine deprived DMEM + 10%FBS. Thus, for all experiments the only difference between CMD media and control media used for each cell line was the concentration of cysteine and methionine.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Animals, orthotopic tumor implantation and diet allocation</strong></p><p><strong>Cell implantation</strong></p><p>Mice were anesthetized with Ketamine/Xylazine (100 mg/kg and 10mg/kg, respectively) and assessed for lack of reflexes by toe pinch. Hair was shaved and scalp skin incised. The skull was cleaned with a q-tip and bregma identified. A burr hole was made with a 17 gauge needle 2 mm lateral and 2 mm anterior to the bregma. Cell suspension was made from lifted adherent cell lines. Intracranial injection (5 x 10^4 MG3 cells in 1 \u03bcL) performed under stereotactic guidance, 2 mm deep into the brain parenchyma aiming for subcortical white matter, using a Hamilton syringe at a flow rate of 0.25 \u03bcL/min. Tumor growth was assessed through monitoring of luciferase signaling by bioluminescence imaging as previously described<strong>[5]</strong>. Mice were injected at 6 weeks for diet survival studies and 8 weeks for diet and convection enhanced delivery pump studies.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Diet allocation</strong></p><p>Special diets were created by LabTest Diet (W.F. Fisher and Sons). A normal chow was used as a baseline (catalog no. 5CC7). From this two diets were created for experimental purposes. The diets used were a control diet with a defined 0.43% methionine and 0.33% cystine (w/w, catalog no. 5WVL) and a cystine deprived-methionine restricted diet with 0.15% methionine and 0.0% cystine (w/w, catalog no. 5WVM). Similar diets have shown safety in mouse experiments<strong>[6]</strong>. Mice were transitioned to the diet 7 days post tumor implantation. Investigators were not blinded to the allocation during experiments or outcome assessments.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Convection enhanced delivery</strong></p><p>Pump implantation was conducted as previously described<strong>[5]</strong>. After randomization to control or CMD diets, mice were further randomized into control or RSL3 pump groups. Mini osmotic pumps (Alzet, model 2ML1) were filled with either 0.5% DMSO in PBS (control) or 500nM RSL3. These pumps infuse ~200 \u03bcL of fluid over 7 days. Pump implantation was carried out on DPI 21 as previously described<strong>[7]</strong>. Explant was conducted on DPI 28 and mice were followed until endstage.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Tissue Collection</strong></p><p>Mice were assessed daily for signs of tumor morbidity. Mice were anesthetized with intraperitoneal injection of ketamine/xylazine (100 mg/g and 10 mg/kg, respectively). Following cessation of toe pinch reflex, mice were perfused with PBS. For end stage tumors the anterior most portion of the brain, which encompassed the anterior most tip of tumor was sectioned and placed in 4% PFA. Remaining brains were harvested and placed on an aluminum weigh boat floating in liquid nitrogen for flash freezing. For short time point experiments the whole brain was flash frozen as described.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Sonabend AM, Yun J, Lei L, Leung R, Soderquist C, Crisman C, Gill BJ, Carminucci A, Sisti J, Castelli M, Sims PA, Bruce JN, Canoll P.
