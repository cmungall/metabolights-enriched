                "description": "The diversity and number of species present within microbial communities create the potential for a multitude of interspecies metabolic interactions. Here, we develop, apply, and experimentally test a framework for inferring metabolic mechanisms associated with interspecies interactions. We perform pairwise growth and metabolome profiling of co-cultures of strains from a model mouse microbiota. We then apply our framework to dissect emergent metabolic behaviors that occur in co-culture. Based on one of the inferences from this framework, we identify and interrogate an amino acid cross-feeding interaction and validate that the proposed interaction leads to a growth benefit in vitro. Our results reveal the type and extent of emergent metabolic behavior in microbial communities composed of gut microbes. We focus on growth-modulating interactions, but the framework can be applied to interspecies interactions that modulate any phenotype of interest within microbial communities.",

                        "description": "Strains were inoculated from frozen stock to grow a dense lawn on agar plates containing BHI media. Prior to inoculation, all agar plates were equilibrated inside an anaerobic chamber for at least 24 hrs. Inoculated plates were incubated for 3-9 days before being used to start overnight cultures. For overnight cultures, 50 ml of mLB broth in a 500 ml glass flask was inoculated using a generous streak from the lawn of each strain, then each flask was covered with a Breathe-Easy membrane (Diversified Biotech, Dedham, Massachusetts, USA). After 18-24 hrs of incubation at 37\u00b0C, overnight cultures were transferred to 50 ml conical tubes, sealed, transferred out of the chamber, and centrifuged at 1500 x g for 5 mins. After centrifugation, samples were transferred into the chamber, supernatant was poured off, and pellets were resuspended in 12.7 ml mLB broth. The resuspension for each species was then diluted to make inoculant with the same concentration of cells as a solution at an optical density of 0.01, measured at OD600 with 100 \u00b5l of sample volume in a flat-bottom 96-well plate (with a well diameter of 0.64 cm). This final inoculant was then used to inoculate mLB broth in 12-well plates. For monoculture samples, 100 \u00b5l of inoculant was added to 2.9 ml of media. For co-culture samples, 100 \u00b5l of each strain\u2019s inoculant was added to 2.8 ml of media. 12-well plates were covered with a Breathe-Easy membrane, then the 12-well plate lid was placed on top of the membrane. Inoculated, covered 12-well plates were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 72 hrs.\n\tAfter 72 hrs of incubation, 12-well plates were removed from the incubator and membranes were opened for each well using a razor. For each well, the sample was mixed by pipetting 900 \u00b5l three times, then 1.8 ml of sample was transferred to a 2 ml snap-cap tube. 200 \u00b5l of sample was also collected after mixing and transferred to a 96-well plate to measure optical density at OD600. Samples within 2 ml tubes were then transferred out of the chamber and centrifuged at 18407 x g for 2 mins. After centrifugation, supernatant was poured directly into a 3 ml syringe attached to a syringe pump filter (0.22 \u00b5m pore size, mixed cellulose ester filter) and filtered into a 2 ml snap-cap tube. Cell pellets were then resuspended in 400 \u00b5l Qiagen lysis buffer (Buffer ASL, Qiagen) and vortexed until thoroughly mixed. Resuspended pellets and spent media were then frozen at -80 \u00b0C.\n\tTo ensure reproducibility, 3 experiments were performed in which independent overnight starter cultures were used to inoculate 3 samples per monoculture and co-culture condition (resulting in 9 total replicates). For the third experiment, ASF492 and ASF500 did not appear to grow in monoculture according to both OD600 and qPCR, and their metabolomes did not appear significantly different than any negative controls, so all sample groups containing ASF492 and ASF500 in the third experiment were excluded from analyses. As a result, those sample groups have N = 6 replicates throughout the study.\n",
