                "description": "Polyketide synthase (PKS) and nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) hybrid\u00a0systems typically use complex protein-protein interactions to facilitate direct transfer of intermediates between these\u00a0multimodular megaenzymes. In the canal-associated neurons (CANs) of Caenorhabditis elegans, PKS-1 and NRPS-1 produce the nemamides, the only known hybrid polyketide-nonribosomal peptides biosynthesized by animals, through a poorly understood mechanism. Here, we use genome editing and mass spectrometry to map the roles of individual PKS-1 and NRPS-1 enzymatic domains in nemamide biosynthesis. Furthermore, we show that nemamide biosynthesis requires at least five additional enzymes expressed in the CANs\u00a0that are encoded by genes distributed across the worm genome. We identify the roles of these enzymes and discover a mechanism for trafficking intermediates between a PKS and an NRPS. Specifically, the enzyme PKAL-1 activates an advanced polyketide intermediate as an adenylate and directly loads it onto a carrier protein in NRPS-1. This trafficking mechanism\u00a0provides a means by which a PKS-NRPS system can expand its biosynthetic potential and is likely important for the regulation of nemamide biosynthesis.",

Strains used in this study were obtained from Caenorhabditis Genetics Center or were generated through genome editing by CRISPR-Cas9 or through transgenesis (<strong>Table S2</strong> in the paper associated with this study). Some strains were backcrossed with <strong>wild-type strain</strong> (<strong>N2</strong>). The double mutants were generated from single mutants, using standard genetic crossing methods. The presence of alleles was verified through single worm PCR using primers in <strong>Table S3</strong> in the paper associated with this study and/or followed by restriction site digestion, as shown in <strong>Table S4 </strong>in the paper associated with this study.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><em>C. elegans </em><strong>wild-type</strong> and <strong>mutant </strong>worm strains (<strong>pkal-1</strong> and<strong> C32E8.6</strong>) were grown at room temperature on two NGM agar plates (10 cm) spread with 0.75 mL 25X OP50 until the food on the plates was almost gone. Then, the worms were transferred to 1 L Erlenmeyer flasks containing S medium (350 mL). The worm cultures were grown at 22.5 \u00b0C for 3-5 d until no food was left and were fed with 3.5 mL of 25X OP50 every day. For sample collection, the culture flasks were placed in an ice-bath for 30 min to 1 h to settle the worms. Then, the worms were transferred from the bottom of the flasks to a 50 mL centrifuge tube and were centrifuged (1000 rpm for 5 min) to separate the worms from the worm medium. The process was repeated until most of the worms were removed from the flasks. The collected worms were washed with water 3 times and centrifuged (1000 rpm for 5 min), and then they were soaked in 10 mL of water for 1 h in a shaking incubator (22.5 \u00b0C, 225 rpm) to remove bacteria from their digestive tract. The worms were collected by centrifugation and were freeze dried.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Large-scale worm extraction for biosynthetic intermediates</strong></p><p>The extraction method was similar to one previously reported but with modifications<strong>[1]</strong>. 50 mL of wild-type or mutant strain cultures were inoculated and shaken at 180 rpm for 7-10 d at 20 \u00b0C in 2.8 L baffled flasks&nbsp;containing 500 mL of CeHR medium with 20% cow\u2019s milk. 44 Worms were collected by centrifugation, washed with water, shaken in water for 30 min to clear their intestines, and washed again with water. Worms were stored frozen at -20 \u00b0C until needed.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>LC-MS-based PKAL-1 activity assay</strong></p><p>To examine the activity of PKAL-1 and its catalytic mutant, a LC-MS-based assay was used as previously described<strong>[2]</strong>. Generally, 50 \u00b5L reaction mixture contained 100 mM potassium phosphate at pH 7.0, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM CoA, 5 mM ATP, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1 mM fatty acid substrate. The reaction was initiated by adding 2 \u00b5L of 2 mg/mL purified PKAL-1 or PKAL-1(K488A) enzyme at 25 \u00b0C for 2 h. 50 \u00b5L methanol was added to quench the reaction, and the reaction was vortexed and centrifuged.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Shou Q, Feng L, Long Y, Han J, Nunnery JK, Powell DH, Butcher RA.

The ground worms were extracted with 15 mL of 190 proof ethanol for 3.5 h, and the extract was centrifuged (3500 rpm for 20 min). The supernatant was collected and dried using a speedvac. The dried worm samples were each resuspended in 100 \u03bcL of methanol, sonicated (if needed), and centrifuged (15000 rpm for 1 min) before analysis by LC-MS.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Large-scale worm extraction for biosynthetic intermediates</strong></p><p>For the extraction and fractionation process, worms from 2 L-worth of culture (around 5-10 g of dried worm) were processed at a time. After freeze drying, worms were ground for 15 min with 50-100 g of sand using a mortar and pestle. The pulverized worms were transferred to a 1 L Erlenmeyer flask, and 300 mL of 190-proof ethanol was added to the flask. The flask was shaken at 300 rpm for 3.5 h. The extract was filtered using a Buchner funnel and filter paper and evaporated with a rotavap at 25 \u00b0C. The extract was then subjected to silica gel chromatography (50-100 g silica gel) and eluted with a gradient of hexane, ethyl acetate, ethyl acetate/methanol (1:1) and methanol (350 mL each) to give 4 fractions (A - D). Fractions C and D were processed separately, evaporated with a rotavap at 27 \u00b0C, redissolved in 12 mL of methanol, and centrifuged at 3,500 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was dried and dissolved in 10 mL 70% methanol/water. The resulting cloudy sample was then applied to an HP-20ss column (100 g HP-20ss resin), eluting with methanol/water (7:3 to 9:1 to 10:0) to give 12 subfractions (1 to 12, 125 mL each). Each fraction was dried by rotavap and analyzed by LC-MS for peaks with the same characteristic triene/tetraene UV spectrum found in the nemamides. The amount of nemamide or intermediate was calculated based on the total UV area of HPLC traces (UV at 280 nm for nemamide A-like molecules and UV at 320 nm for nemamide B-like molecules), normalized by sample dilutions and the total amount (g) of dried worms used for extraction. UV peaks were verified by masses in both positive and negative modes. Percentage for each compound in each sample was compared to the mean amount of nemamide A or nemamide B in <strong>wild type</strong>. <strong>pkal-1</strong> or <strong>C32E8.6 </strong>mutants containing different alleles were analyzed, and they showed very similar&nbsp;intermediate patterns. For the <strong>pkal-1 </strong>mutant, the reb28 allele was used for most analyses of single and double mutants. For the <strong>C32E8.6</strong> mutant, the reb23 allele was used for most analyses of single mutants. At least 2 or 3 independent experiments were performed for each worm strain.&nbsp;</p>",
