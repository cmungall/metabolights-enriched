                "description": "Recent studies have provided links between glutamine metabolism and bone remodeling, but little is known about its role in primary osteoporosis progression. We aimed to determine the effects of inhibiting glutaminase (GLS) on two types of primary osteoporosis and elucidate the related metabolism. To address this issue, age-related and ovariectomy (OVX)-induced bone loss mouse models were used to study the in vivo effects of CB-839, a potent and selective GLS inhibitor, on bone mass and bone turnover. We also studied the metabolic profile changes related with aging and GLS inhibition in primary bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) and that related with OVX and GLS inhibition in primary bone marrow-derived monocytes (BMM). Besides, we studied the possible metabolic processes mediating GLS blockade effects during aging-impaired osteogenic differentiation and RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation respectively via in vitro rescue experiments. We found that inhibiting GLS via CB-839 prevented OVX-induced bone loss while aggravated age-related bone loss. Further investigations showed that effects of CB-839 treatment on bone mass were associated with alterations of bone turnover. Moreover, CB-839 treatment altered metabolic profile in different orientations between BMSC of aged mice and BMM of ovariectomized mice. In addition, rescue experiments revealed that different metabolic processes mediated glutaminase blockade effects between aging-impaired osteogenic differentiation and RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation. Taken together, our data demonstrated the different outcomes caused by CB-839 treatment between two types of osteoporosis in mice, which were tightly connected to the suppressive effects on both aging-impaired osteoblastogenesis and OVX-enhanced osteoclastogenesis mediated by different metabolic processes downstream of glutaminolysis.",

All animal experiments were performed in Experimental Animal Center of Tongji Hospital (Wuhan, China) strictly following the guidelines for care and use of laboratory animals, and all experimental protocols involving animals in this study were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee of Tongji Hospital (No. TJH-202103001). Wild-type mice were housed in (5 mice per cage) a specific pathogen-free (SPF) animal laboratory with controlled conditions (18-22 \u00b0C and a 12:12 h light-dark cycle) and allowed free access to clean food and water. Mice of the same sex were caged together.</p><p><br></p><p>CB-839 was dissolved and formulated as a solution at 20 mg/mL in vehicle which consisted of 10 mmol/L citrate solution and 25% hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (PH = 2.0). For the study of OVX-induced bone loss, 8-week-old C57BL6/J female mice were housed in the SPF facility for 2 weeks before anesthetized by an intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital for bilateral ovariectomy or sham operation. Later, mice were randomly divided into 4 groups (sample size n = 7 for each group) followed by specified treatment started 2 weeks after surgery (12 weeks of age): sham-operated mice treated with vehicle (SHAM group) or 200 mg/kg CB-839 (SHAM + CB-839 group), and ovariectomized mice treated with vehicle (OVX group) or 200 mg/kg CB-839 (OVX + CB-839 group). Mice were weighted weekly and treated with CB-839 (200 mg/kg body weight) or same volume of vehicle via intragastric administration twice daily (every 12 h). After 8 weeks of treatment, mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation after being anesthetized and long bones including femurs and tibias were excised.</p><p><br></p><p>For the study of age-related bone loss, 2-month-old and 14-month-old C57BL6/J male (or female) mice were housed in the SPF facility for 2 months before treatments. Then young and aged male (or female) mice were randomly divided into four groups (sample size n = 6 for each group) followed by specified treatment in each group: young mice treated with vehicle or CB-839, and old mice treated with vehicle or CB-839. Treatment of either vehicle or CB-839 was performed in the same way (same dose, route, frequency and duration of administration) as that described in the above OVX-induced bone loss study. After 8 weeks of treatment, sample collections of 6-month-old and 18-month-old male (or female) mice were done likewise.</p><p><br></p><p>For every mouse involved in above animal studies, we firstly isolated bone marrow cells as previously described.&nbsp;Briefly, after being dissected and cut in order to expose marrow cavity, freshly isolated femur and tibia bones from C57BL6/J mice were flushed with PBS containing 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and bone marrow cells were suspended in the solution. Then red blood cells were depleted from the cell suspensions via red blood cell lysis buffer rapidly and the remaining cells were subsequently centrifuged at 300 G. The pelleted bone marrow cells (total BMC) were subsequently used to isolate BMSC (bone marrow stromal cells) and BMM (bone marrow-derived monocytes). BMSC isolation from total BMC and collection were performed as described by Maridas et al. in 2018. The non-adherent hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) in the former step were transferred to Ficoll-Hypaque (GE Healthcare) density gradient to collect BMM from the buffy coat layer. Both BMSC and BMM were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen suddenly after collection and sent to Novogene Co., Ltd (Beijing, China) in dry ice.</p>",

Parameters were set as follows: actual mass tolerance, 5 ppm; retention time tolerance, 0.2 min; signal/noise ratio, 3; signal intensity tolerance, 30% and minimum intensity, 100,000. Peak intensities were subsequently normalized to the total spectral intensity and the normalized data were used to predict the molecular formula based on molecular ion peaks, additive ions and fragment ions. Next, the peaks were referenced to the mzCloud (https://www.mzcloud.org/), MassList and mzVault database and the accurate qualitative and relative quantitative results were generated. The statistical software R (R version R-3.4.3), Python (Python 2.7.6 version) and CentOS (CentOS release 6.6) were employed to perform statistical analyses. Identified metabolites were annotated using the KEGG database (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/), HMDB (http://www.hmdb.ca/) and Lipidmaps database (http://www.lipidmaps.org/).</p>",
