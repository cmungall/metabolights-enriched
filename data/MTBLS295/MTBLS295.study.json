                "description": "Both marine phytoplankton and terrestrial plants have to deal with limited bioavailability of the key life nutrient, phosphate. In freshwater algae and plants, a phosphate starvation response gene (psr1) has been characterized, which encodes for a transcription factor that regulates the metabolic response to phosphate deficiency. This study describes a psr1-like gene present in Micromonas pusilla and other prasinophytes as well as the haptophyte, Emiliana huxleyi. The metabolic response of M. pusilla to P-deficiency, as described from targeted and untargeted metabolomics techniques, was characteristic of an algal response to nutrient limitation with an increase in polyunsaturated fatty acids. The levels of many central metabolites, such as amino acids, vitamins, nucleosides, decreased in response to P-deficiency, with a few notable exceptions including malate, aspartate, glutamate, guanine and xanthine. Additionally, genes involved in the metabolic pathways associated with the elevated metabolites share a significant motif in their intron regions, which may be the regulatory element where the psr1 gene product binds. Results form the present study taken together with data from the literature suggests that M. pusilla, other prasionophytes and E. huxleyi, may be physiologically well poised to take advantage of a future ocean with lower nutrient levels and increased levels of pCO2.",

Therefore, the dried extracts were re-dissolved in 0.01 M hydrochloric acid and extracted using a 50 mg/1 cc PPL cartridge following the protocol of [2]. The resulting methanol extracts were re-dissolved in 95:5 water:acetonitrile.\n</p>\nThe filtrate for each sample, representing the extracellular metabolite fraction, was processed using SPE as described above (following [1]) but with 1 g/6 cc cartridges.

The chromatography gradient was: an initial hold of 95% A (0.1% formic acid in water) : 5% B (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile) for 2 min, ramp to 65% B from 2 to 20 min, ramp to 100% B from 20 to 25 min, and hold until 32.5 min. The column was re-equilibrated for 7 min between samples with solvent A. Each metabolite was quantified using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode with optimal parameters determined from infusion of authentic standards. Eight-point external calibration curves (0.5, 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 250, and 500 ng/ml) were generated for each compound by plotting peak area against concentration.\n</p>\nFor untargeted metabolomics analysis, LC separation was performed using a Synergi Fusion reversed phase column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) with the same gradient as for targeted analysis.",
