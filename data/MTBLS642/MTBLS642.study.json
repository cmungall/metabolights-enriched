                "description": "Using cells as microbial factories enables highly specific production of chemicals with many advantages over chemical syntheses. A number of exciting new applications of this approach are in the area of precision metabolic engineering, which focuses on improving the specificity of target production. In recent work, we have used precision metabolic engineering to design lycopene-producing Escherichia coli for use as a low-cost diagnostic biosensor. To increase precursor availability and thus the rate of lycopene production, we heterologously expressed the mevalonate pathway. We found that simultaneous induction of these pathways increases lycopene production, but induction of the mevalonate pathway before induction of the lycopene pathway decreases both lycopene production and growth rate. Here, we aim to characterize the metabolic changes the cells may be undergoing during expression of either or both of these heterologous pathways. After establishing an improved method for quenching E. coli for metabolomics analysis, we used two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GCxGC-MS) to characterize the metabolomic profile of our lycopene-producing strains in growth conditions characteristic of our biosensor application. We found that the metabolic impacts of producing low, non-toxic levels of lycopene are of much smaller magnitude than the typical metabolic changes inherent to batch growth. We then used metabolomics to study differences in metabolism caused by the time of mevalonate pathway induction and the presence of the lycopene biosynthesis genes. We found that overnight induction of the mevalonate pathway was toxic to cells, but that the cells could recover if the lycopene pathway was not also heterologously expressed. The two pathways appeared to have an antagonistic metabolic effect that was clearly reflected in the cells' metabolic profiles. The metabolites homocysteine and homoserine exhibited particularly interesting behaviors and may be linked to the growth inhibition seen when the mevalonate pathway is induced overnight, suggesting potential future work that may be useful in engineering increased lycopene biosynthesis.",

                        "description": "In experiments comparing the metabolic changes based on lycopene production levels, cells were transformed with individual plasmids.  In experiments comparing the effect of the mevalonate pathway, cells were cotransformed with two plasmids. Following transformation, cells were plated on LB plates with appropriate antibiotics for selection and grown at 37\u00b0C overnight.  Freshly transformed colonies were then inoculated in triplicate into LB medium with the appropriate inducers and grown at 37\u00b0C and 180 rpm for 18 hours. Cultures were then concentrated and inoculated to an OD of 0.2 in fresh medium, the appropriate inducers were added, and the sample was aliquoted into culture tubes corresponding to different time points.  Samples were analyzed at the time of inoculation and at hours 1, 2, 4, and 6.  At each time point, optical density and lycopene content were measured, and samples were collected for metabolomics analysis.  Optical density was quantified by measuring the absorbance at 600 nm in a ThermoFisher Genesys 20 spectrophotometer with a 10 mm path length.\nAn additional triplicate set of pLac32EBI+pBad\u00d8 samples as well as two triplicate sets of wild type were grown during the lycopene production comparison experiment to control for variation between experiment days. Lycopene extractions and quenching of these samples were performed with those from the lycopene production comparison experiment, but one set of wild-type samples as well as the additional set of pLac32EBI+pBad\u00d8 samples were stored in a -80\u00b0C freezer until extraction of the second experiment\u2019s samples.\nLB medium composed of 10 g L-1 NaCl, 5 g L-1 yeast extract, and 10 g L-1 tryptone was used in all experiments.  Either 1 mM IPTG or 0.01% (w/v) arabinose was used for induction, and the following antibiotics were used for appropriate selection: tetracycline (15 \u00b5g/mL), kanamycin (30 \u00b5g/mL), and carbenicillin (100 \u00b5g/mL).\nThe quenching method is a modified version of the methods in Spura et al. and Yasid et al. [1,2]. A quenching solution composed of 30% ethanol (v/v) and 0.6% NaCl (w/v) in a 15 ml or 50 mL conical was cooled to -15\u00b0C. Eachtube was prefilled with a certain amount of quenching solution for a 2:1 quench:sample ratio based on estimated OD at sampling time. Samples were taken at 0 hours, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, and 6 hours for both experiments to capture the metabolic profile over a relevant timeframe for lycopene production. The sample was added to each tube and quickly mixed by inversion. Each tube was kept in a -15\u00b0C 70% methanol bath until the sample temperature reached -5 to -8\u00b0C.  The tubes were then centrifuged for 5 minutes at 3500rpm at -10\u00b0C and transferred back to a -15\u00b0C bath. The supernatant was removed and the tubes were frozen in liquid nitrogen. The samples were stored in a -80\u00b0C freezer until extraction.\n\nThe extraction method is a modified version of the freeze-thaw method in Faijes et al. and Yasid et al. [2,3]. The cell pellet was resuspended in 500 \u00b5L of -80\u00b0C methanol and transferred to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. The suspension was then frozen in liquid nitrogen, thawed on ice, and centrifuged for 2 minutes at 10,000 g at 4\u00b0C. The supernatant was collected and stored in a separate microcentrifuge tube. The pellet was again suspended in an additional 500 \u00b5L of -80\u00b0C methanol, frozen, thawed, and centrifuged under the same conditions as the previous step. The supernatant was collected, and the pellet was resuspended with 250 \u00b5L of cold water, undergoing this freeze-thaw process for a final time. Once the supernatant was collected, the pooled supernatants were more accurately normalized to OD and were transferred to a CentriVap to be centrifugally concentrated at 40\u00b0C until completely dry. The dried samples were stored in a -80\u00b0C freezer for later processing.\n\nReferences:\n[1] Spura, Jana, et al.

Samples were centrifuged at 21,100 g for 3 minutes, and 50 \u03bcL of the supernatant was added to an autosampler vial. Samples were spiked with 0.25 \u03bcL of a retention time standard solution composed of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMES) and an internal standard of nonadecanoic acid methyl ester dissolved in dimethylformamide. In parallel, a quality control (QC) sample was prepared by removing 150 \u03bcL of extract from each sample and aliquoting 1.15 mL for experiments comparing the metabolic changes based on lycopene production levels. For experiments comparing the effect of the mevalonate pathway, 75 \u03bcL was removed. 1.15 mL and 0.65 mL of QC was aliquoted for each experiment respectively, dried, and derivatized with each batch of 9-10 samples.\n",

The inlet was functioning in splitless mode with a purge flow of 100 mL/min delayed to start 30 seconds after injection, giving a total flow of 101 mL/min. Runs were performed in a gas saver mode with a flow of 20 mL/min set to start a minute after injection. Front inlet temperature was set at 250\u00b0C for the entire run. The primary oven temperature was held at 70\u00b0C for 1 min and the temperature was ramped at 10\u00b0C/min until 315\u00b0C and held for 2 minutes. The secondary oven temperature and the modulator temperature offsets were 5\u00b0C and 15\u00b0C above the main oven respectively. One minute equilibration time was set for the ovens.

                        "description": "Sample runs were analyzed in ChromaTOF (LECO, St. Joseph, MI) to determine baseline, peak area, and peak identification. Briefly, settings included a baseline offset of 0.5, automatic smoothing, 1st dimension peak width of 36 seconds, 2nd dimension peak width of 0.10 seconds, and a match of 700 required to combine peaks with a minimum signal-to-noise (S/N) of 5 for all subpeaks. Peaks were required to have a S/N of 10 and have a minimum similarity score of 800 before assigning a name. Unique mass was used for area and height calculation.\nMetPP (http://metaopen.sourceforge.net/metpp.html) was used to align the samples [4]. Sample files and a derivatization reagent blank file were uploaded from ChromaTOF. Unknowns were retained during the peak alignment process. The derivatization reagent blank file was used to subtract peaks resulting from the sample preparation reagents from the corresponding cells\u2019 sample files. On-the-fly alignment was used with manually selected quality control samples as the peak list for primary alignment. Due to the size of the mevalonate induction time variation experiment, MetPP could not handle on-the-fly alignment using all of the quality control samples. Instead, one quality control sample was used from each batch as well as additional quality controls from the first, last, and fifth batches to perform on-the-fly alignment. Peak alignment was performed using the default criteria.\nAfter alignment, further processing of the data was done based on the procedure previously described [5]. Batch effects were removed from the data set using LOESS for both experiments. To remove analytes that were not reproducibly detected, analytes for which more than half of the values were missing in the QC samples or for which the QC samples had a coefficient of variance larger than 0.5 were removed from the data set. Then, missing values were manually corrected using small value correction only if all the values were missing in the biological replicate.\nSamples from the mevalonate induction time experiment were processed with Combat [6] to remove batch effects that were evident from principal component analysis of the initial data.\nFinally, MetaboAnalyst (http://metaboanalyst.ca/) was used for statistical and pathway analysis [7]. For both analyses, remaining missing values were k-nearest neighbors (KNN) corrected. Data was filtered using the interquantile range method and then log-transformed using generalized logarithm transformation (base 2) and autoscaled. Differences were considered significant at false discovery rate-corrected p < 0.5.\nAll samples from the experiment comparing the metabolic effects of the amount of lycopene production, except for one triplicate wild type set and the pLac32EBI+pBad\u00d8, were extracted, derivatized, and analyzed together. All samples for the experiment comparing the metabolic effect of the mevalonate pathway as well as those excluded from the previous experiment were extracted, derivatized, and analyzed together.\n\nReferences:\n[4] Wei, Xiaoli, et al.
