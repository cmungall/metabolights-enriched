The MaHPIC continues with ongoing support from the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) and others. The MaHPIC generates many data types (e.g., clinical, hematological, parasitological, metabolomics, functional genomics, lipidomics, proteomics, immune response, telemetry) and mathematical models, to iteratively test and develop hypotheses related to the complex host-parasite dynamics in the course of malaria in non-human primates (NHPs), and metabolomics data via collaborations with investigators conducting clinical studies in malaria endemic countries, with the overarching goal of better understanding human disease, pathogenesis, and immunity. Curation and maintenance of all data and metadata are the responsibility of the MaHPIC.",

                "description": "<b>MaHPIC Experimental Description:</b><br/> Malaria-naive male rhesus macaques (<i>Macaca mulatta</i>), approximately four years of age, were inoculated intravenously with salivary gland sporozoites produced and isolated at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from multiple <i>Anopheles</i> species (<i>An. dirus, An. gambiae</i>, and <i>An. stephensi</i>) and then profiled for clinical, hematological, parasitological, immunological, functional genomic, lipidomic, proteomic, and metabolomic measurements. The experiment was designed for 100 days, and pre- and post-100 day periods to prepare subjects and administer curative treatments respectively. The anti-malarial drug artemether was subcuratively administered to all subjects at the initial peak of infection, one out of the five macaques received four additional subcurative treatments for subsequent recrudescence peaks. The experimental infection in one subject was ineffective but the macaque was followed-up for the same period of 100 days. The different clinical phases of the infection were clinically determined for each subject. Blood-stage curative doses of artemether were administered to all subjects at the end of the study. Capillary blood samples were collected daily for the measurement of CBCs, reticulocytes, and parasitemias. Capillary blood samples were collected every other day to obtain plasma for metabolomic analysis. Venous blood and bone marrow samples were collected at seven time points for functional genomic, proteomic, lipidomic, and immunological analyses.<br/><br/>Within the MaHPIC, this project is known as \u2018Experiment 03\u2019. This dataset was produced by Dr. Regina Cordy and Manoj Khadka at Emory University.

This page will be updated as datasets are released to the public. The experimental design and protocols for this study were approved by the Emory University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). <br/><br/><b>Complete list of dataset contributors:</b><br/>The MaHPIC Consortium, Jeremy D.

Remove the plastic lid of the AbsoluteIDQ kit plate. Add 10 \u00b5l of the ISTD to all wells of the plate with exception of the blank well position A1. <br />2. Use a single channel pipette to accurately pipette 10 \u00b5l of the sample (PBS for zero samples, Biocrates calibration standards, QCs, and your samples) onto the center of the spot. Gently touch the filter inserts with the pipette tip while pipetting the samples. <br />3. Dry samples for 30 min at room temperature under nitrogen using a nitrogen evaporator. (Note: Make sure the evaporator needles are at least 5 mm above the filter inserts. Adjust the pressure at the nitrogen pressure to about 3-4 bars and check that there is a nitrogen flow at the end of the evaporator needles.)<br />4. Prepare the pre-mix and derivatization solution.<br />5. Use the derivatization solution immediately and pipette 50 \u00b5l to each well.<br />6. Cover the plate with the plastic lid. Let the reaction take place for 20 mins at room temperature. (Note: Ineffective removal of excess of PITC and pyridine may result in poor mass spectrometry results.)<br />7. Remove the plastic lid. Dry the plate in the nitrogen evaporator for 60 mins.<br />8. Add 300 \u00b5l of extraction solvent to each well. <br />9. Cover the plate with the plastic lid again. Shake the plate at maximum of 450 rpm at room temperature for 30 mins.<br />10. Centrifuge the kit plate for 2 mins at 500 X g (make sure the centrifuge is balanced). Visually check that the fill level is the same in all wells of the capture plate. If not, repeat and apply higher g or higher pressure, respectively.<br />11. Carefully remove the tape from the sides of the kit plate. Separate the lower capture plate (containing the samples extracts, labeled 'Use for FIA') from the upper filter plate. Make sure nothing spills or splashes over during this process.<br />12. Remove 50 \u00b5l from each well of the capture plate (labeled 'Use of FIA') and transfer it to the empty 96 deep well plate labeled 'Use for LC'. Remove 10 \u00b5l from each well of the capture plate (labeled 'Use for FIA') and transfer it to the empty deep well plate labeled 'Use for FIA dilution- if required'.<br />13. Use the plate labeled 'Use for LC' to dilute extracts for LC. Add 450 \u00b5l of 40% methanol (in HPLC grade water) to each well and seal the plate with a silicone mat. Make sure that the silicone mat is seated correctly on the plate. Firmly press the mat&rsquo;s naps into the wells. Shake for 2 mins at 600 rpm. Shake for 2 mins at 600 rpm.<br />14. Use capture plate labeled 'Use for FIA dilution-If required'. Add 490 \u00b5l of FIA mobile phase to each well and seal the plate with a silicone mat. Make sure that the silicone mat is seated correctly on the plate. Firmly press the mat&rsquo;s naps into the wells. Shake for 2 mins at 600 rpm.<br />15. Both plates, labeled 'Use for LC' and 'Use for FIA dilution-If required', are ready for LC-MS/MS and FIA-MS/MS analytics, respectively. Place the sealed plates into the autosampler at 10 \u00b0C or store 4 \u00b0C.</p>",
