                "description": "Male factor infertility is involved in almost half of all infertile couples. Lack of the ejaculated sperm owing to testicular malfunction has been reported in 6-10% of infertile men, a condition named nonobstructive azoospermia (NOA). In this study, we investigated untargeted metabolomic profiling of the seminal plasma in NOA men using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and advance chemometrics. In this regard, the seminal plasma fluids of 11 NOA men with TESE-negative, nine NOA men with TESE-positive and 10 fertile healthy men (as a control group) were collected. Quadratic discriminate analysis (QDA) technique was implemented on total ion chromatograms (TICs) for identification of discriminatory retention times. We developed multivariate classification models using the QDA technique. Our results revealed that the developed QDA models could predict the classes of samples using their TIC data. The receiver operating characteristic curves for these models were >0.88. After recognition of discriminatory retention time's asymmetric penalized least square, evolving factor analysis, correlation optimized warping and alternating least squares strategies were applied for preprocessing and deconvolution of the overlapped chromatographic peaks. We could identify 36 discriminatory metabolites. These metabolites may be considered discriminatory biomarkers for different groups in NOA.",

The semen of NOA men was collected before TESE operation and kept for further analysis. Of the 20 NOA men, 11 men were TESE-negative (AZN) and 9 were TESE-positive (AZP). The F (n=10), AZP (n=9) and AZN (n=11) notations are respectively used for the fertile, NOA TESE-negative and NOA TESE-positive groups in subsequent parts of the paper. The study was approved by the ethical committee of Avicenna Research Institute, Tehran, Iran (code 910107\u2013023).\n</p>\nTESE is a common operation performed on the testicle and is an invasive method for detection of sperm from the nonobstructive azoospermia men. The surgeon removes eight to 10 small parts of the testicle looking for the existence of the sperm under microscope. If the sperm exist then it is TESE-positive and if there is no sperm it is TESE-negative. When there is sperm they will use it for ICSI. In order to increase the accuracy of the TESE-positive and TESE-negative diagnosis in this work, the TESE operation was repeated twice on each sample to confirm the results of previous test (i.e. it was repeated twice for each sample).",

Prior to analysis by GC\u2013MS the seminal plasma samples were extracted to separate polar metabolites from nonpolar (lipophilic) metabolites. The polar metabolites were subjected to further analysis by GC\u2013MS. Each sample was analyzed in triplicate by GC-MS which gave almost 90 runs. These samples were run over a period of time.\n</p>\nPolar metabolites are extracted briefly as follows: an aliquot of 400 \u00b5l of seminal plasma was extracted with 500 \u00b5l of cold HPLC-grade methanol\u2013double-distilled water (9:1 vol/vol) and vortexed for 1 min. The sample was kept at 4 \u00b0C for 20 min and then centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 8 min. After centrifugation, 300\u2013400 \u00b5l of the supernatant was evaporated to dryness using a Speedvac concentrator (Savant Instruments Inc., SDC-100-H, Farmingdale, NY, USA). After Speedvac evaporation, a common protocol for carbonyl methoximation and hydroxyl, primary amine and thiolsilylation was followed for the polar metabolites. Extracted residues were reconstituted in 40 \u00b5l of 20 mg/ml methoxyamine hydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich) in ACS-grade pyridine and incubated at room temperature for 16 h. Then 50 \u00b5l of N-methyl-N-trifluoroacetamide with 1% trimethylchlorosilane derivatization agent (Pierce) was added and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h on a hotplate. The samples were vortexed twice during incubation to ensure complete dissolution. Derivatized samples were stored for <48 h at 4 \u00b0C until analysis.",
