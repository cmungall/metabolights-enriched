                "description": "<p>The mechanistic role of the airway microbiome in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) remains largely unexplored. We present a landscape of airway microbe-host interactions in COPD by an in-depth profiling of sputum metagenome, metabolome, host transcriptome and proteome from 99 COPD patients and 36 healthy individuals. Multi-omic data were integrated using a sequential mediation analysis, to assess in silico associations of the microbiome with neutrophilic or eosinophilic inflammation, two primary COPD inflammatory endotypes, mediated through microbial metabolic interaction with host gene expression. Mechanistic links of microbiome-metabolite-host interaction were identified leveraging microbial genetic information and established metabolite-human gene pairs. The strongest link for neutrophil-predominant COPD was altered tryptophan metabolism driven by airway lactobacilli resulting in reduced indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), which was in turn linked to perturbed host IL-22 signaling and epithelial cell apoptosis pathways. In vivo and in vitro studies showed that airway microbiome-derived IAA mitigates neutrophilic inflammation, apoptosis, emphysema, and lung function decline, via IL-22-mediated macrophage-epithelial cell crosstalk. Intranasal inoculation of two airway lactobacilli restored IAA and recapitulated its protective effects in mice. These findings provide the rationale for therapeutically targeting microbe-host interaction in COPD.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Linked studies:</strong></p><p><strong>UPLC-MS/MS assays</strong> of original cohort human samples are reported in&nbsp;this study.</p><p><strong>UPLC-MS/MS&nbsp;assays</strong> of&nbsp;more recent cohort human samples are reported in&nbsp;<a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS5423' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS5423</strong></a>.</p><p><strong>UPLC-MS/MS&nbsp;assays</strong> of&nbsp;more recent murine samples are reported in&nbsp;<a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS6894' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS6894</strong></a>.</p>",

For the validation cohort, induced sputum samples were obtained from 27 patients with stable COPD and 18 controls in Shenzhen People\u2019s Hospital in Shenzhen, China. The study was approved by the ethics committee of the 2 centers (reference number: 2017-22 and KY-LL-2020294-01). All COPD patients met the diagnostic criteria according to GOLD guideline<strong>[1]</strong>. The inclusion and exclusion criteria were described in previous studies<strong>[2][3]</strong>. Patients with antibiotic usage within 4 wk were excluded. All 135 individuals were subject to sputum metagenomic profiling, whereas 129 and 130 individuals had available samples for metabolomic and host transcriptomic profiling respectively; 124 individuals had matched 3 types of omic profiling. Sputum and serum proteome were profiled for a subset of 59 individuals.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Quality control of sputum samples:</strong></p><p>Induced sputum was obtained from all subjects and quality controlled upon collection. Briefly, sputum plugs which contained the most viscous material were placed in a petri dish and isolated from saliva. The selected sputum plugs were prepared for cytology by dilution with 0.1% dithiothreitol solution and filtered through 48-\u03bcm nylon-mesh filter according to a standardized sputum processing protocol<strong>[4]</strong>. The numbers of total cells, squamous epithelial cells and leukocytes were counted and recorded. Sputum specimens with squamous epithelial cells:leukocytes&lt;1:2.5 were considered minimally contaminated with oropharyngeal materials and were acceptable for downstream experiments<strong>[5]</strong>. 5 and 2 sputum samples were excluded from Guangzhou and Shenzhen cohort respectively in the sputum quality control process.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> GOLD.
