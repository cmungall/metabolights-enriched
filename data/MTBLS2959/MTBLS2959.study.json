                "description": "<p>Over 170 post-transcriptional RNA modifications have been described and are common in all kingdoms of life. These modifications range from methylation to complex chemical structures, with methylation being the most abundant. RNA modifications play a key role in RNA folding and function and their dysregulation in humans has been linked to several diseases such as cancer, metabolic diseases or neurological disorder. Nowadays, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry is considered the gold standard method for the identification and quantification of these modifications due to its sensitivity and accuracy. However, the analysis of modified ribonucleosides by mass spectrometry is complex due to the presence of positional isomers. In this scenario, optimal separation of these compounds by highly sensitive liquid chromatography combined with the generation of high-information spectra is critical to unequivocally identify them, especially in high-complex mixtures. Here we present an analytical method that comprises a new type of mixed-mode nano-flow liquid chromatography column combined with high- and low-collision energy data-independent mass spectrometric acquisition for the identification and quantitation of modified ribonucleosides. The method produces content-rich spectra and combines targeted and screening capabilities thus enabling the identification of a variety of modified nucleosides in biological matrices by single-shot liquid chromatographic analysis coupled to mass spectrometry.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Data-independent acquisition</strong> is reported in the current study <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS2959' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS2959</strong></a>.</p><p><strong>Mixed-mode column chromatography</strong> is reported in <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS2497' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS2497</strong></a>.</p>",

A further dilution with water was made prior LC-MS analysis of the mixes to a final concentration of 800 fmol/\u00b5L per compound. A total of 1 \u00b5L of each diluted mix (800 fmol/\u00b5L) was injected in all experiments except for the calibration curves and the experiment with different loading volumes.

For the preparation of the Reference C18 column, a suspension of C18 reverse-phase material Synergi 4 \u00b5m Hydro RP 80 \u00c5 (04A-4375, Phenomenex) was used, whereas for the preparation of the mixed-mode column, a suspension containing 95% Synergi 4 \u00b5m Hydro RP 80 \u00c5 (04A 4375, Phenomenex) and 5% Hypercarb Carbon 3 \u00b5m 250 \u00c5 (35003-054646, Thermo Fisher Scientific).

Prior analysis, <strong>msconvert</strong> (v3.0.11626, <strong>ProteoWizard</strong>)<strong>[3]</strong> and <strong>OpenMS</strong> (v2.5)<strong>[4]</strong> were used to split the MS2 spectra obtained in the DIA raw files with a collision energy of 20 and 80 NCE. The sum of all fragment ion areas per compound was used to build a multi-point linear calibration curve for each mono-methylated ribonucleoside. The calibration curves were created in <strong>Skyline</strong> using the logarithmic scale. The limit of quantification (LOQ) was calculated using a maximum of 40% coefficient of variation, whereas the limit of detection (LOD) was calculated from the fragment area of the blank samples, plus 3x standard deviation. Reference normalized retention time (nRT) were generated as previously described<strong>[5][6]</strong>. Briefly, cytidine and adenosine were arbitrarily assigned to 10 and 100, respectively, and the nRT values for each ribonucleoside (x) was determined using the following equation: nRTx = 100 \u2212 [(RTa \u2212 RTx)/(RTa \u2212RTc)] x 90.</p><p><br></p><p>For building the reference spectral library 1 \u00b5L (800 fmol/\u00b5L) of each diluted mix (Mix 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5) was analyzed by LC-PRM with a collision energy of 80, a quadrupole isolation window of 1.4 m/z, and MS/MS scans collected over a mass range of 50-250 m/z in order to obtain the fragments of each ribonucleoside. <strong>Thermo Xcalibur</strong> (v4.4.16.14) was used to obtain molecular formula for the fragment with relative intensity greater than 10% of each ribonucleoside. Extracted fragment ions were then used to create the target list in <strong>Skyline</strong> to query the DIA acquired data (Mix 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and yeast samples).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Adams KJ, Pratt B, Bose N, Dubois LG, St John-Williams L, Perrott KM, Ky K, Kapahi P, Sharma V, MacCoss MJ, Moseley MA, Colton CA, MacLean BX, Schilling B, Thompson JW; Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Metabolomics Consortium.
