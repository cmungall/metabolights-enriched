                "description": "<p>An extract prepared from species of Paris is the most widely consumed herbal product in China. The genus Paris includes a variety of genotypes with different medicinal component contents but only two are defined as official sources. Closely related species have different medicinal properties because of differential expression of proteins and metabolites. To better understand the molecular basis of these differences, we examined proteomic and metabolomic changes in rhizomes of P. polyphylla var. chinensis, P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis, and P. fargesii var. fargesii using a technique known as sequential window acquisition of all theoretical mass spectra as well as gas chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry. In total, 419 proteins showed significant abundance changes, and 33 metabolites could be used to discriminate Paris species. A complex analysis of proteomic and metabolomic data revealed a higher efficiency of sucrose utilization and an elevated protein abundance in the sugar metabolic pathway of P. polyphylla var. chinensis. The pyruvate content and efficiency of acetyl-CoA-utilization in saponin biosynthesis were also higher in P. polyphylla var. chinensis than in the other two species. The results expand our understanding of the proteome and metabolome of Paris and offer new insights into the species-specific traits of these herbaceous plants.</p><p><strong>SIGNIFICANCE:</strong> The traditional Chinese medicine Paris is the most widely consumed herbal product for the treatment of joint pain, rheumatoid arthritis and antineoplastic. All Paris species have roughly the same morphological characteristics; however, different members have different medicinal compound contents. Efficient exploitation of genetic diversity is a key factor in the development of rare medicinal plants with improved agronomic traits and malleability to challenging environmental conditions. Nevertheless, only a partial understanding of physiological and molecular mechanisms of different plants of Paris can be achieved without proteomics. To better understand the molecular basis of these differences and facilitate the use of other Paris species, we examine proteomic metabolomic changes in rhizomes of Paris using the technique known as SWATH-MS and GC/TOF-MS. Our research has provided information that can be used in other studies to compare metabolic traits in different Paris species. Our findings can also serve as a theoretical basis for the selection and cultivation of other Paris species with a higher medicinal value.</p>",

The identity of all plant materials was confirmed by Professors Dingrong Wan and Hong Liu of the South-Central University for Nationalities. The 3 species were grown simultaneously in the experimental field in 3 plots under identical environmental conditions, with field management applied to reduce any environmental impacts. In particular, soil moisture was maintained between 30% and 40%, and a sunshade net with a coverage of 70% was used during plant growth. Plants were grown in two-row plots of 6.0 x 1.4 m, with 0.8-m spacing between beds and 0.3-m spacing between plants. After 4 years of growth, plants with no pests or diseases and a height of approximately 0.7 m were selected for study. The rhizomes of each species were harvested in September from 10 different plants in the 3 experimental plots to normalize growth and developmental effects.

                        "description": "<p>10 rhizome tissue samples of each species were separately ground with liquid nitrogen for analysis. The powdered plant material (200 mg) was first vortexed with 8 ml methanol for 3 min and then subjected to ultrasonication for 1 h at room temperature<strong>[1]</strong>. Methoxyamine hydrochloride (20 mg/ml) was prepared with pyridine, and 0.2 mg/ml ribitol was prepared by dissolving ribitol in water and used as an internal standard[2]. The derivatization protocol was similar to our previously published methods<strong>[2]</strong>. First, oximation reactions were performed to protect ketones and aldehydes of compounds using methoxyamine hydrochloride solution (40 ml; 20 mg/ml, in pyridine) at 130 rpm and 30 \u00b0C for 90 min. To increase compound volatilities, trimethylsilylation of acidic protons was then carried out using N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)-trifluoroacetamide solution at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min. Finally, the derivatized samples were stored at 4 \u00b0C before detection.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Lee J, Jung Y, Shin JH, Kim HK, Moon BC, Ryu DH, Hwang GS.
