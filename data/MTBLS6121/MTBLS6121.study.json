                "description": "The gut microbiota is the largest and most complex microecosystem in animals. It is influenced by the host's dietary habits and living environment, and its composition and diversity play irreplaceable roles in animal nutrient metabolism, immunity, and adaptation to the environment. Although the gut microbiota of red deer has been studied, the composition and function of the gut microbiota in Gansu red deer (Cervus elaphus kansuensis), an endemic subspecies of red deer in China, has not been reported. In this study, the composition and diversity of the gut microbiome and fecal metabolomics of C. elaphus kansuensis were identified and compared for the first time by using 16S rDNA sequencing, metagenomic sequencing, and LC-MS/MS. There were significant differences in gut microbiota structure and diversity between wild and farmed C. elaphus kansuensis. The 16S rDNA sequencing results showed that the genus UCRD-005 was dominant in both captive red deer (CRD) and wild red deer (WRD). Metagenomic sequencing showed similar results to those of 16S rDNA sequencing for gut microbiota in CRD and WRD at the phylum and genus levels. 16S rDNA and metagenomics sequencing data suggested that Bacteroides and Bacillus might serve as marker genera for CRD and WRD, respectively. Fecal metabolomics results showed that 520 metabolites with\u00a0significant differences were detected between CRD and WRD and most differential metabolites were involved in lipid metabolism. The results suggested that large differences in gut microbiota composition and fecal metabolites between CRD and WRD, indicating that different dietary habits and living environments over time have led to the development of stable gut microbiome characteristics for CRD and WRD to meet their respective survival and reproduction needs. KEY POINTS: \u2022 Environment and food affected the gut microbiota and fecal metabolites in red deer \u2022 Genera Bacteroides and Bacillus may play important roles in CRD and WRD, respectively \u2022 Flavonoids and ascorbic acid in fecal metabolites may influence health of red deer.",

Red deer were artificially fed throughout the year. The deer were observed and sampled immediately after defecation. Individual samples were collected individually and kept in ice boxes before being transported to the laboratory and stored at -80 \u00b0C. 19 fecal samples of <strong>wild red deer (WRD)</strong> were collected from Sidalong Nature Reserve Station, Zhangye City, Gansu Province. The activity area of wild population was tracked. After the population left, feces were searched in that area immediately, and the freshness degree of feces was determined according to the color, humidity and temperature. Disposable sterile gloves were used to collect intact and fresh feces and put them into single sterile bags to avoid cross-contamination. The samples were kept in an ice box before being returned to the laboratory and stored at -80 \u00b0C.</p>",
