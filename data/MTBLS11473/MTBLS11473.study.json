                "description": "<p>Background: The use of sulfonamides (SAs) caused residual pollution in the environment. Bacteria play an important role in the degradation of sulfonamide antibiotics, and microbial consortium offers advantages over single bacterium. However, the complex degradation process and interaction mechanisms within such consortiums still poorly understood. </p><p>Results: Here, a consortium named ACJ, consisting of Leucobacter sp. HA-1, Bacillus sp. HC-1 and Gordonia sp. HAEJ-1, obtained from activated sludge of pharmaceutical plants, was identified as capable of degrading various SAs. Several papers failed to get the pure culture of Leucobacter sp. in the degradation of SAs, here we successfully obtained the Leucobacter sp. HA-1 pure culture involved in the degradation of SAs with the growth factors provided by strain HC-1 or HAEJ-1. Strain HA-1 was responsible for the initial attack of sulfonamide molecules resulting in the release of 2-aminoquinoxaline (2-AQ) and trihydroxybenzene (HHQ), which were further degraded and used for growth by strain HAEJ-1. Genomic, metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses revealed genes associated with nucleotide repair, ABC transporters, quorum sensing, TCA cycle and cell cycle in strain HA-1 were up-regulated during co-culture compared without the other two strains, which indicated that HA-1 utilized certain factors from strain HC-1 or HAEJ-1 for growth. </p><p>Conclusion: These results revealed that there was a bidirectional ecological relationship of cross-feeding and co-degradation among consortium ACJ. In summary, this study provides new insights into the mechanisms of microbial consortium interaction and co-degradation in antibiotic-contaminated environments.</p>",

After searching the database, the data matrix was uploaded to cloud.majorbio.com for analysis. Firstly, the data matrix is preprocessed as follows: The data matrix uses the 80% rule to remove the missing value, that is, to retain at least one set of samples with a non-zero value of more than 80%, and then fill the gap value (the minimum value in the original matrix to fill the gap value). In order to reduce the error caused by sample preparation and instrument instability, the response intensity of the sample essential spectrum peak is normalized by the sum normalization method, and the normalized data matrix is obtained. At the same time, variables with relative standard deviation (RSD) &gt; 30% of QC samples were deleted, and log10 logization was carried out to obtain the final data matrix for subsequent analysis. Secondly, the ropls package (v1.6.2) in R language was used to conduct principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal least partial square discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) on the pre-processed data matrix, and the stability of the model was evaluated by using 7 cycles of interactive verification. The selection of metabolites with significant differences was based on the variable weight value (VIP) obtained by OPLS-DA model and the P-value of student's t test. The metabolites with VIP &gt; 1 and p &lt; 0.05 were identified as significantly different metabolites. Differences metabolites by KEGG database (https://www.kegg.jp/kegg/pathway.html) for the metabolic pathways of annotation, differences of metabolites involved in pathways. The Python software package scipy.stats was used for pathway enrichment analysis, and the biological pathways most relevant to experimental treatment were obtained by Fisher exact test.</p>",
