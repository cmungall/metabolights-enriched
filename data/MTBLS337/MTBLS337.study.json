                "description": "Breast tumors are characterized into different subtypes based on their surface marker expression, which affects their prognosis and treatment. For example, triple negative breast cancer cells (ER-/PR-/Her2-) show reduced susceptibility towards radiotherapy and chemotherapeutic agents. Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors have shown promising results in clinical trials, both as single agents and in combination with other chemotherapeutics, in several subtypes of breast cancer patients. PARP1 is involved in DNA repair, apoptosis, and transcriptional regulation and an understanding of the effects of PARP inhibitors, specifically on metabolism, is currently lacking. Here, we have used NMR-based metabolomics to probe the cell line-specific effects of PARP inhibitor and radiation on metabolism in three distinct breast cancer cell lines. Our data reveal several cell line independent metabolic changes upon PARP inhibition, including an increase in taurine. Pathway enrichment and topology analysis identified that nitrogen metabolism, glycine, serine and threonine metabolism, aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis and taurine and hypotaurine metabolism were enriched after PARP inhibition in the three breast cancer cell lines. We observed that the majority of metabolic changes due to radiation as well as PARP inhibition were cell line dependent, highlighting the need to understand how these treatments affect cancer cell response via changes in metabolism. Finally, we observed that both PARP inhibition and radiation induced a similar metabolic response in the HCC1937 (BRCA mutant cell line), but not in MCF-7 and MDAMB231 cells, suggesting that radiation and PARP inhibition share similar interactions with metabolic pathways in BRCA mutant cells. Our study emphasizes the importance of differences in metabolic responses to cancer treatments in different subtypes of cancers.",

                        "description": "The peaks were annotated through the HMDB [1] and Metabohunter [2] and targeted profiling [3] was accomplished using ChenomX NMR Suite Profiler (version 7.7, ChenomX Inc.).  The concentrations were referenced to a TMSP concentration of 0.5 mM. Over 95% of the peaks were assigned to metabolites available in the ChenomX library and the quantified metabolite concentrations were exported to an Excel file. Metabolites with sample to sample variation (within replicates) which had a coefficient of variance higher than 0.3 were excluded from the analysis. These included acetate, citrate, guanidoacetate, isobutyrate, and malate, the majority of which are low confidence metabolites, generally present at very low concentrations and in regions with high overlap of peaks. The concentration data matrix was further normalized by the total concentration of metabolites in each sample to evaluate the metabolite fractions and also to account for the differences in efficiencies of extraction.</br>\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Wishart DS, Jewison T, Guo AC, Wilson M, Knox C, Liu Y, et al.
