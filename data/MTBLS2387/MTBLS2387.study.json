Plasma, serum, and urine samples were collected from fifty-two children with Idiopathic PA and forty-eight age-matched controls from the division of Pediatric Endocrinology of the University Hospital of Patras were enrolled.</h4><h4><strong>RESULTS:</strong> Metabolomic results showed that plasma and serum glucose, myo-inositol, amino acids, a population of unsaturated lipids, and esterified cholesterol were higher and significantly different in PA children. In the metabolic profiles of children with PA and age-matched control group a gradual increase of glucose and myo-inositol levels was observed in serum and plasma, which was positively correlated their body mass index standard deviation score (BMI SDS) values respectively. Urine <sup>1</sup>H NMR metabolic fingerprint of PA children showed positive correlation and a clustering-dependent relationship with their BMI and bone age (BA) respectively.</h4><h4><strong>CONCLUSION:</strong> This study provides evidence that PA driven metabolic changes begin during the childhood and PA may has an inductive role in a BMI-driven increase of specific metabolites. Finally, urine may be considered as the best biofluid for identification of the PA metabolism as it reflects more clearly the PA metabolic fingerprint.</h4>",

The clinical inclusion criteria for PA were: onset of signs of adrenarche before the age of 8 years for girls and 9 years for boys and the presence of pubic and/or axillary hair. Patients with clitoris enlargement and pubertal children were excluded as well. All patients were followed for at least 6 months and none entered puberty. None of the children with the endocrinologic disorder had underline adrenal pathology as a cause of adrenarche. None of the PA children and control subjects were on any medication. Birth weight and length were recorded from the national book of child's health. The Control group consisted of girls attending our community pediatric outpatient clinic for routine health visits and screening blood tests, or our paediatric department for preoperative assessment for minor surgeries. Age, height (measured by a Harpenden stadiometer) and weight were measured, and pubertal status was clinically assessed according to Tanner stages. Bone age from the patients was assessed by the same senior pediatric endocrinologist (D. Chrysis) based on X-Rays from the left hand and wrist evaluated according to Greulich and Pyle atlas. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University Hospital of Patras. All children and their parents were informed, and written consent was obtained before participation in the study.</p><p><br></p><p>The 3 biofluids were collected, stored and prepared for NMR analysis according to different protocols suitable for blood derivatives and urine. The protocol adaptations applied on previously published protocols<strong>[1]</strong>. Sample assemblage was performed at the Department of Paediatric Endocrinology while storage and NMR sample preparation were carried out at the Department of Pharmacy of Patras University.</p><p><br></p><p>Fasting plasma and serum samples were withdrawn from donors using BD Vacutainer K3-EDTA spray-coated tubes and BD Vacutainer SST, respectively. Serum samples were mixed mildly, and they have been left 30 min at room temperature for the completion of the clotting cascade. All blood samples were centrifuged at 1,500 x g for 10 min at RT. Supernatant from each sample was aliquoted in 2 or 3 fractions of 600 \u03bcL. The number of fractions was determined by the initial sample quantity. Aliquots were stored in 2 mL cryovials at -80 \u00b0C.</p><p><br></p><p>Urine samples were collected in fasting state and were stored immediately at 4 \u00b0C for a maximum of 2 h before their centrifugation at 2,500 x g for 10 min at RT. Supernatant from each sample was aliquoted in 3 fractions of 1 mL and they were stored in 2 mL cryovials at -80 \u00b0C.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Bernini P, Bertini I, Luchinat C, Nincheri P, Staderini S, Turano P.

Hence, plasma and serum samples were mixed with a buffer of pH=7.42 (0.14 M Na2HPO4, 4% NaN3 in H2O). In the buffer, 0.5 mM 4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonic acid (DSS) was also added as a chemical shift reference. Buffer used for urine samples prepared in 100% D2O and pH=7.42 (1.5 M KH2PO4, 0.05 mM DSS and 4% NaN3 2 mM). Plasma and serum samples were vortexed for 30 s and for each one a total of 300 \u03bcL were mixed with 240 \u03bcL buffer and 60 \u03bcL D2O to a total volume of 600 \u03bcL. Correspondingly, 540 \u03bcL of each urine sample were mixed with 60 \u03bcL buffer and were vortexed for 30 s. The final step before NMR experiments was the transfer of 550 \u03bcL in a 5 mm NMR tube (Bruker BioSpin srl.).</p>",

For the same reason, were also excluded 8, non-suitable for analysis, spectra of the total of 300 (see <strong>Table 2</strong> in the paper associated with this study). 0- and first-order phase correction of spectra were applied and subsequently, all spectra were aligned using <strong>TopSpin 4.0.7</strong> (Bruker BioSpin srl.). Both procedures were completed manually. Plasma and serum spectra were calibrated on the double resonance peak of anomeric proton of a-glucose at 5.24 ppm because of its greater chemical shift stability, while urine spectra calibrated on the DSS singlet at 0.00 ppm. The NMR spectral data were converted by <strong>AMIX software</strong> (Bruker BioSpin srl.) in bucket tables. Spectral regions 0.00-10.00 ppm were segmented into integrated spectral domains (buckets) of equal width (0.02 ppm) excluding the water signal. Furthermore, resonance peaks of the anticoagulant EDTA (H-EDTA, Ca2+-EDTA, Mg2+-EDTA) were excluded from the bucketing of plasma data, while DSS and Urea resonance peaks were excluded from the bucketing of urine data. A total of 451 buckets have been created for plasma <strong>1H CPMG</strong> spectra, 463 buckets for serum<strong> 1H CPMG </strong>spectra and 423 buckets for urine<strong> 1H NOESY</strong> spectra. Pareto scaling was selected as the most suitable scaling method for the blood samples and autoscaling for urine samples.</p>",
