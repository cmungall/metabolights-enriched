                "description": "Secondary metabolites are frequently involved in mechanisms of the plant tolerance to environmental stresses. Determining metabolic biomarkers for drought tolerance may be a useful implementation in increasing and stabilizing crop plant productivity. The most accurate and fast tool for this purpose is the ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC). It enabled a rapid discrimination between samples from plants grown in different water limitation regimes. Multivariate statistical analysis was applied to handle and interpret the complexity of the generated data. UHPLC raw data was mathematically pre-processed to reduce the effects of instrumental factors. The multivariate analysis of variance was used to find the significant changes in the secondary metabolites composition induced by the drought stress. Tests were performed on 9 varieties of spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) originating from Europe, North America and Syria. Drought stress was applied at different developmental stages. The UHPLC results suggest that the changes in metabolite profiles are a stage-specific trait and alter in the life cycle. In addition, there is variability in metabolites selected as significant for the reaction to drought depending on sampling time and variety. In parallel, an ion trap mass spectrometer with an electrospray ion source coupled to a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and UV detector was used for qualitative analysis of phenolic compounds and identification of the potential biomarkers.",

They were processed using our own R-scripts in the following way:\n</p>\na) Normalization: the raw data were normalized by mass of samples, which means that every single chromatogram value was divided by the mass of the appropriate extracted leaf sample.</br>\nb) Baseline removal: chromatographic baselines need to be removed since they can negatively affect the alignment and ultimately the results of the data analysis. Therefore baselines were removed using the numerical differentiation without their explicit estimation.</br>\nc) Retention time alignment: the correlation optimized warping (COW) was chosen for this purpose. This method operates on the entire chromatograms prior to the peak detection (see point d); it aligns profiles by matching their shapes and compressing or expanding time intervals, whereas the peak height and area are generally unaffected.</br>\nd) Peak detection: peaks are here interpreted as the retention time intervals in which some kind of metabolite or a group of metabolites with similar chromatographic properties occurs. Peaks within individual chromatograms were detected using profiles of the second derivative; since the second derivative is usually characterized by a high noise, it was smoothed by a cubic smoothing spline. The inflection points were located to find boundaries for the individual peaks and peaks common for several (or all) chromatograms were built. Such defined peaks are not equivalent to chromatographic peaks present in different individual chromatograms as sometimes they cover several peaks (usually with small intensity).</br>",
