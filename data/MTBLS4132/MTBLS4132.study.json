                "description": "Polymyxin B (PB) is introduced into the clinic as the last-line therapy against carbapenem-resistant <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> (CRKP). Unfortunately, increased resistance to PB in <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> (<i>K. pneumoniae</i>) has threatened global health. Resistance of <i>K. pneumoniae</i> to PB was induced by passaging in serial concentrations of PB and determined by microbroth dilution method. Growth characteristics of induced strains including growth curve, reversibility of resistance, and biofilm formation (crystal violet staining method) were measured. This study employed TMT-labeled quantitative proteomics and LC-MS/MS metabolomics analysis to investigate the key biological processes associated with PB resistance in <i>K. pneumoniae</i>. A total of 315 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified, of which 133 were upregulated and 182 were downregulated in the PB-resistant <i>K. pneumoniae</i>. KEGG enrichment analysis revealed that the DEPs were mainly involved in ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters and cationic antimicrobial peptide (CAMP) resistance. Proteins related to central carbon metabolism were inhibited in the PB-resistant <i>K. pneumoniae</i>, but proteins mediating LPS modification were activated. Transcriptional levels of CAMP resistance-related proteins were significantly different between PB-susceptible and -resistant <i>K. pneumoniae</i>. PB treatment led to an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels of <i>K. pneumoniae</i>. Metabolomics data demonstrated that 23 metabolites were significantly upregulated in PB-resistant <i>K. pneumoniae</i> and 5 were downregulated. The differential metabolites were mainly lipids, including glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, and fatty acids. Exposure to PB resulted in increased level of phospholipid transport gene <i>mlaF</i> in <i>K. pneumoniae</i>. Our study suggested that membrane remodeling and inhibited central carbon metabolism are conducive to the development of PB resistance in <i>K. pneumoniae</i>.",

                        "description": "<p><strong>Bacterial Strains and Reagents</strong> </p><p>The <strong>K. pneumoniae </strong>clinical isolates used in this study were obtained from the gastric juice, sputum and feces of neonate and adult inpatients in the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University (Changsha, Hunan, China). All isolates were identified by Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry (Bruker Daltonik, Bremen, Germany). PB solution was prepared immediately before each experiment with sterile distilled water and PB powder (Sangon Biotech, Shanghai, Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China). Phosphatidylethanolamine (Sigma-Aldrich, Melbourne, VIC, Australia) was dissolved in methanol as recommended to prepare a stock solution with a concentration of 53.6 \u00b5mol/ml. The final concentration of phosphatidylethanolamine used to treat bacteria was based on previous literature<strong>[1]</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test </strong></p><p>Antimicrobial susceptibility test was performed on the last generation of <strong>K. pneumoniae</strong> strains passaged in each concentration using Phoenix 100 automatic microbial analysis system (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, United States). The MIC values of <strong>K. pneumoniae</strong> isolates and induced strains to polymyxin B were further confirmed using broth dilution method in Mueller-Hinton (MH) broth (Rishui Biotech Co., Ltd., Qingdao, China) recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines (Institute, 2006). The induced resistant strains were plated on antibiotic-free blood agar at 37 \u00b0C for 18-24 h. Single colony was selected and inoculated to blood ager plate for subculture. Resistance phenotype of<strong> K. pneumoniae </strong>against erythromycin was obtained by K-B method. Erythromycin disk was purchased from Oxoid (United Kingdom). Since CLSI does not provide breakpoint of erythromycin against Enterobacteriaceae, the inhibition zone diameter was just recorded. Results of antimicrobial susceptibility tests were interpreted using breakpoints recommended by the CLSI.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>In vitro Induction of Polymyxin B Resistance</strong></p><p>A single colony of K. pneumoniae clinical isolates was inoculated into Luria-Bertani (LB) broth (Sangon Biotech, Shanghai, Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) and grew at 37 \u00b0C 180 rpm. Bacterial suspension was serially passaged in LB broth with increasing concentrations of PB (1, 2, 4, and 8 \u00b5g/ml) to induce resistance. Briefly, the overnight culture was diluted 1:100 in LB broth with PB. Since the MIC of KPWT to PB was 2 \u00b5g/ml, only two generations were passaged in LB broth with PB concentration of 1 \u00b5g/ml and 2 \u00b5g/ml, and three successive generations were passaged in liquid medium with PB concentration of 4 \u00b5g/ml and 8 \u00b5g/ml. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Growth Curve Measurement</strong> </p><p>Bacterial cells were inoculated into 5 ml fresh LB broth to reach a bacterial density of about 1 \u00d7 106 CFU/ml. PB and/or PE were added to the tubes to achieve the desired concentration. The cultures were grown at 37 \u00b0C and 180 rpm. For the PE treated group, bacterial suspension containing 1% methanol was used as <strong>control</strong>. Optical density at 600 nm (OD600nm) of each culture at different <strong>time points</strong> <strong>(0, 2, 4, 8, 14, 24</strong> <strong>h</strong>) was measured by Thermo Multiskan GO (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States) to monitor bacterial growth condition. OD value of each testing group minus that of MH broth without bacteria. The results represented the mean value of 3 independent replicates.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Biofilm Formation Assay</strong> </p><p>Biofilm formation was determined by crystal violet staining method as described in previous literature<strong>[2],[3]</strong>. For each strain, 200 \u00b5l bacterial suspension (1 \u00d7 106 CFU/ml) was inoculated to 3 wells of 96-well plates (Corning, Corning, NY, United States), sterile MH broth served as negative control. After static incubation at 37 \u00b0C for 24 h, each well was washed with sterile normal saline for 3 times to remove the planktonic cells. After drying, biofilms were stained using 0.1% (wt/vol) crystal violet for 15 min and washed with sterile normal saline 3 times. Decolorization was performed with 95% ethanol (v/v) and the absorbance at 595 nm was measured by Thermo Multiskan GO (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States). The experiment was performed in triple and results showed mean \u00b1 SD.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Yadav J, Ismaeel S, Qadri A.

Cell pellets were collected from the 1ml culture after centrifugation at 1,000 \u00d7 g and 4 \u00b0C for 10 min. The supernatant was removed and bacteria was quickly quenched in liquid nitrogen for 30 s to stop the metabolic process. After quenching, the bacteria were thawed on ice, washed twice with 4 \u00b0C or 20 \u00b0C precooled 1 \u00d7 phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to remove the remaining medium components, and then was centrifuged (10 min at 1,000 \u00d7 g, 4 \u00b0C) to remove the PBS buffer. 6 biological replicates were prepared for PB susceptible and - resistant strains, respectively. The samples were stored at \u201380 \u00b0C before LC-MS/MS analysis. Cellular metabolites of the PB-resistant and -susceptible K. pneumoniae were extracted through a previously reported method<strong>[1]</strong>. 600 \u00b5L extraction solution (methanol: acetonitrile: water = 2:2:1 (V/V), containing isotopically labeled internal standard mixture) was added to the samples, and bacteria samples were transferred into EP tube. After vortexing for 30s, the solution was homogenized at 35 Hz for 4 min and sonicated for 5 min (in ice water). This step was repeated for 3 times and then samples were incubated for 1 h at -40 \u00b0C. Subsequently, the supernatant was collected by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 \u00b0C and transferred to a clean glass vial for LC-MS/MS analysis.

The UHPLC-QTOF/MS method has been described in detail in the previous literature (Wang et al., 2016). Mobile phase A was composed of 25 mmol/L ammonium acetate and 25 mmol/L ammonia hydroxide in water (pH = 9.75), and mobile phase B was acetonitrile. Gradient conditions were as follows: 0\u223c0.5 min, 95%B; 0.5\u223c7.0 min, 95%\u223c65% B; 7.0\u223c8.0 min, 65%\u223c40% B; 8.0\u223c9.0 min, 40% B; 9.0\u223c9.1 min, 40%\u223c95% B; 9.1\u223c12.0 min, 95% B. Mobile phase flow rate was 0.5 mL/min, the injection volume was 2 \u00b5l, and the column temperature and auto-sampler temperature was 25 and 4 \u00b0C, respectively.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1] </strong>Wang PP, Song X, Zhao XK, Wei MX, Gao SG, Zhou FY, Han XN, Xu RH, Wang R, Fan ZM, Ren JL, Li XM, Wang XZ, Yang MM, Hu JF, Zhong K, Lei LL, Li LY, Chen Y, Chen YJ, Ji JJ, Yang YZ, Li J, Wang LD.

The measurements were filtered if detected peaks were less than half of QC samples. The final data set contained information including the peak number, sample name, and normalized peak area. Then the data were submitted to the<strong> SIMCA15.0.2 </strong>software package (Sartorius Stedim Data Analytics AB, Umea, Sweden) for Principal component analysis (PCA) and supervised orthogonal projection latent structure discrimination analysis (OPLS-DA) to visualize global metabolic differences between the PB susceptible and \u2013resistant K. pneumoniae. To minimize the impact of noise and high variance of variables, data was scaled and logarithmically transformed before analysis. The variable importance in the projection (VIP) of the first principal component in OPLS-DA analysis and P-value (Student\u2019s t-test) were used as the threshold to identify the significantly changed metabolites (VIP &gt; 1 and p &lt; 0.05).</p>",
