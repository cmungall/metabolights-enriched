                "description": "<p>Osteocytes could release some small molecules (\u2264 1 kDa) through gap junctions and hemichannels to extracellular environment, such as prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), nitric oxide (NO) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which play key roles in transferring signals between bone cells and other tissue cells. Connexin (Cx) 43 is the most abundant connexin in osteocytes. To further discover molecules released by osteocytes through Cx43 channels and better understand the regulatory function of Cx43 channels in osteocytes, we performed non-targeted global metabolomics analysis using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) on conditioned medium collected from osteocytes isolated from two transgenic mouse models with Cx43 dominant negative mutants driven by a 10 kb-DMP1 promoter: R76W (gap junctions are blocked, whereas hemichannels are promoted) and \u0394130-136 (both gap junctions and hemichannels are blocked). The results revealed that several new categories of molecules, such as \u201cfatty acyls\u201d and \u201ccarboxylic acids and derivatives\u201d, could be released through osteocytic Cx43 channels. In addition, alteration of Cx43 channel function affected the release of metabolites related to inflammatory reaction and oxidative stress. Pathway analysis further showed that citric acid cycle was the most differential metabolic pathway regulated by Cx43 channels. In sum, these results isolated new potential metabolites released by osteocytes through Cx43 channels, and offered a novel perspective to understand the regulatory mechanisms of osteocytes on themselves and other cells as well.</p>",

All chromatographic separations were performed using a 2777C ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) system (Waters, U.K.). An ACQUITY UPLC HSS T3 column (100 mm x 2.1 mm, 1.8 \u03bcm, Waters, U.K.) was employed for the reversed phase separation. The column oven was kept at 50 \u00b0C and the flow rate was 0.4 ml/min. The mobile phase comprised solvent A (water and 0.1% formic acid) and solvent B (acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid). Gradient elution conditions were set as follows: 100% phase A, 0-2 min; 0% to 100% phase B, 2-11 min; 100% phase B, 11-13 min; 0% to 100% phase A, 13-15 min.

Furthermore, the mass spectrometry data were obtained in Centroid MSE mode. The TOF mass range was from 50 to 1200 Da and the scan time was 0.2 s. Finally, for the MS/MS detection, the whole precursors were fragmented using 20-40 eV, and the scan time was 0.2 s. The LE signal was acquired every 3s to calibrate the mass accuracy. To assess the stability, reliability and reproducibility of the LC-MS/MS system, quality control (QC) samples were obtained by mixing equal volumes (40 \u03bcL) from each tested sample and employed during the whole acquisition. Furthermore, a QC sample (Pool of all samples) was acquired after every 10 tested samples.</p>",

MetaX software was used to perform pre-processing of the extracted data<strong>[1]</strong>, including removing low-quality ions [relative standard deviation (RSD) in the QC samples &gt; 30%]. After quality control-based robust LOESS signal correction (QC-RLSC), the data matrix was analyzed by both principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and a 95% confidence interval (CI) was used as the threshold. The quality of the models was evaluated with the relevant R2 and Q2 as previously reported<strong>[2]</strong>. Meanwhile, permutation tests (200 cycles) were implemented to evaluate the robustness of the PLS-DA model. When the variable influence on projection (VIP) values from the PLS-DA model were greater than 1.0, differential metabolites were selected. Statistically significant differences were tested using Student\u2019s t-test and fold change (FC) analysis, and the p-value was corrected into q-value by false discovery rate (FDR). Generally, metabolites with the characteristics of VIP \u2265 1, FC \u2265 1.2 or \u2264 0.8 and q-value &lt; 0.05 were regarded as significantly difference between the mouse groups.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Wen B, Mei Z, Zeng C, Liu S. metaX: a flexible and comprehensive software for processing metabolomics data.

Data were presented as mean \u00b1SD. Comparisons between two groups were analyzed using 2-tailed unpaired Student\u2019s t-tests. A value of P &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p>",
