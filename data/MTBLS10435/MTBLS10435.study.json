                "description": "<p>We use untargeted metabolomics to investigate the immediate phytochemical effects of autopolyploidy on our model system, the greater duckweed <em>Spirodela polyrhiza</em>, a small aquatic macrophyte from the family Lemnaceae. We compare metabolite abundances in four genetically distinct diploid-autotetraploid pairs to address potential implications for establishment and combine traditional dry mass normalization with nuclear density information to investigate the link with gene dosage. We found that autopolyploidy increases metabolite levels per cell, although there is considerable variation in the response of individual metabolites. However, the impact on metabolite level per biomass is limited because the increased cell size reduces metabolite concentration per cell. Nevertheless, whole genome duplication (WGD) still exerts a discernible quantitative and qualitative influence on the phytochemical composition of our strains, each with potential ecological implications. While some metabolite levels are consistently higher in all tetraploids, many effects are restricted to a single strain, reflecting the importance of genetic background.</p>",

The details of the exact materials we used have been described elsewhere (Bafort et al., 2023). Briefly, 4 diploid strains of Spirodela polyrhiza (Landolt No. 0013, 9242, 9316, and 9346) were acquired from the Landolt collection in Zurich, Switzerland (recently moved to IBBA-CNR, Milan, Italy). Each of these strains represents a clonal lineage and is affiliated with a distinct population genetic cluster (Xu et al., 2019). Artificial neotetraploids of these 4 diploid strains were created using the colchicine protocol of Wu et al. (2023), and the stability of these lines was ascertained by flow cytometric monitoring for a minimum of 2 months after recovery.</p><p><br></p><p>We started a clonal culture from each of the 4 diploid and corresponding autotetraploid strains, beginning with a single frond to ensure genetic homogeneity. The plants were grown in Hoagland\u2019s E-medium (Cross, 2002) on temperature-controlled shelves at 24 \u00b0C with 16 h light/8 h dark at 40-45 \u00b5mol/m^2/s photosynthetic photon flux density. Once these cultures had obtained sufficient biomass, 8 plants of each culture were transferred to 8 random wells spread over 11 six-well plates. After 7 days of growth under the aforementioned growth conditions, approximately 50 mg/fresh mass from each well was harvested, patted dry with paper tissue, transferred to preweighed microcentrifuge tubes with 2x 4-mm stainless steel beads, and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

A gradient of two buffers was used for chromatographic separation: buffer A (H2O:acetonitrile:formic acid, 99:1:0.1, pH 3) and buffer B (acetonitrile:H2O:formic acid, 99:1:0.1, pH 3). Buffer A started at 99% A and 1% B, and was then decreased to 50% A over 30 min and further decreased to 30% A from 30 to 35 min, and finally to 0% A from 35 to 37 min. Buffer B was then kept at 100% for 2 min. Finally, buffer A was increased to 99% over 1 min and held for 5 min.
