HHSN272201200031C, 2012-2017; see http://www.systemsbiology.emory.edu). The MaHPIC has continued with support from the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) and others. The MaHPIC generates many data types (e.g., clinical, hematological, parasitological, metabolomics, functional genomics, lipidomics, proteomics, immune response, telemetry) and mathematical models, to iteratively test and develop hypotheses related to the complex host-parasite dynamics in the course of malaria in non-human primates (NHPs), and metabolomics data via collaborations with investigators conducting clinical studies in malaria endemic countries, with the overarching goal of better understanding human disease, pathogenesis, and immunity. Curation and maintenance of all data and metadata are the responsibility of the MaHPIC.",

                "title": "MaHPIC Experiment 07A and 07B: Quantitative Metabolomics from Macaca fascicularis infected with Plasmodium knowlesi sporozoites to produce and integrate clinical, hematological, parasitological, omics, telemetric and histopathological measures of acute primary infection",
                "description": "E07 was originally planned and implemented prior to E06. The E07 cohort was inoculated with freshly dissected <i>P. knowlesi</i> sporozoites on 11/01/16. However, for unexplained reasons blood-stage parasitemias did not occur. Consequently, the E07 cohort was reinoculated with cryopreserved <i>P. knowlesi</i> sporozoites. This inoculation was performed on 1/20/17.  Hence 'E07A' refers to samples and results from the failed inoculation from 11/01/16 and 'E07B' refers to samples and results from the successful inoculation on 1/20/17. <br/>Telemetry devices (DSI, model L11) with blood pressure sensors and electrocardiogram (ECG) leads were surgically implanted in seven malaria-naive male long-tailed macaques (<i>Macaca fascicularis</i>), approximately five years of age.  After a resting period of three weeks, the telemetry implants were turned on and physiological data that include activity, temperature, ECG, and blood pressure were continuously collected.  After the E07A failed infection using a fresh preparation of salivary gland sporozoites, the implants were deactivated to preserve battery life. Between E07A and E07B, a single rhesus macaque (<i>M. mulatta</i>) was added to the cohort as an infection control with no telemetry implant.  At the start of E07B, telemetry implants were reactivated.  Ten days after reactivation all animals were inoculated intravenously with cryopreserved <i>P. knowlesi</i> Malayan strain salivary gland sporozoites, obtained from <i>Anopheles dirus</i> infected with parasites from the Pk1A+ clone and previously tested in E30 for their infectivity of macaques. The sporozoite stocks used were produced, isolated and cryopreserved at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and then stored at Yerkes.  After inoculation, the macaques were profiled for clinical, hematological, parasitological, immunological, functional genomic, proteomic, and metabolomic measurements.  The experiment was designed with pathology studies and thus terminal necropsies, which were scheduled at the log phase of the infection, at the peak of parasitemias, at the middle of the chronic phase, or at the end of the follow-up period of 45 days after the inoculation of the sporozoites.  Capillary blood samples were collected daily for the measurement of complete blood counts (CBCs), reticulocytes, and parasitemias.  Capillary blood samples were collected every other day to obtain plasma for metabolomic analysis.  Venous blood and bone marrow samples were collected at six time points for functional genomic, targeted proteomic, targeted metabolomics, and immunological analyses.  Physiological data noted above were continuously captured via telemetry. <br/> Within the MaHPIC, this project is known as 'Experiment 07'. This dataset was produced by Dr. Regina Cordy and Manoj Khadka at Emory University.

This page will be updated as datasets are released to the public. The experimental design and protocols for this study were approved by the Emory University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and the MRMC Office of Research Protection Animal Care and Use Review Office (ACURO).

Use a single channel pipette to accurately pipette 10 ul of the sample (PBS for zero samples, Biocrates calibration standards, QCs, and your samples) onto the center of the spot. Gently touch the filter inserts with the pipette tip while pipetting the samples. <br />3. Dry samples for 30 min at room temperature under nitrogen using a nitrogen evaporator. (Note: Make sure the evaporator needles are at least 5 mm above the filter inserts. Adjust the pressure at the nitrogen pressure to about 3-4 bars and check that there is a nitrogen flow at the end of the evaporator needles.)<br />4. Prepare the pre-mix and derivatization solution.<br />5. Use the derivatization solution immediately and pipette 50 ul to each well.<br />6. Cover the plate with the plastic lid. Let the reaction take place for 20 mins at room temperature. (Note: Ineffective removal of excess of PITC and pyridine may result in poor mass spectrometry results.)<br />7. Remove the plastic lid. Dry the plate in the nitrogen evaporator for 60 mins.<br />8. Add 300 ul of extraction solvent to each well. <br />9. Cover the plate with the plastic lid again. Shake the plate at maximum of 450 rpm at room temperature for 30 mins.<br />10. Centrifuge the kit plate for 2 mins at 500 X g (make sure the centrifuge is balanced). Visually check that the fill level is the same in all wells of the capture plate. If not, repeat and apply higher g or higher pressure, respectively.<br />11. Carefully remove the tape from the sides of the kit plate. Separate the lower capture plate (containing the samples extracts, labeled 'Use for FIA') from the upper filter plate. Make sure nothing spills or splashes over during this process.<br />12. Remove 50 ul from each well of the capture plate (labeled 'Use of FIA') and transfer it to the empty 96 deep well plate labeled 'Use for LC'. Remove 10 ul from each well of the capture plate (labeled 'Use for FIA') and transfer it to the empty deep well plate labeled 'Use for FIA dilution- if required'.<br />13. Use the plate labeled 'Use for LC' to dilute extracts for LC. Add 450 ul of 40% methanol (in HPLC grade water) to each well and seal the plate with a silicone mat. Make sure that the silicone mat is seated correctly on the plate. Firmly press the mat&rsquo;s naps into the wells. Shake for 2 mins at 600 rpm. Shake for 2 mins at 600 rpm.<br />14. Use capture plate labeled 'Use for FIA dilution-If required'. Add 490 ul of FIA mobile phase to each well and seal the plate with a silicone mat. Make sure that the silicone mat is seated correctly on the plate. Firmly press the mat&rsquo;s naps into the wells. Shake for 2 mins at 600 rpm.<br />15. Both plates, labeled 'Use for LC' and 'Use for FIA dilution-If required', are ready for LC-MS/MS and FIA-MS/MS analytics, respectively. Place the sealed plates into the autosampler at 10 &deg;C or store 4 &deg;C.</p>",

Those files were used for subsequent data acquisition and analysis. The raw data (.wiff) files are used for calculation of analyte concentration and manual check of peak integration in Analyst 1.6.3.
