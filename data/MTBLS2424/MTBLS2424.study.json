                "description": "Coral growth anomalies (GAs) are tumor-like protrusions that are detrimental to coral health, impacting both the coral skeleton and soft tissues. These lesions are increasingly found throughout the tropics and are commonly associated with high human population density, yet little is known about the molecular pathology of the disease. Here, we investigate the metabolic impacts of GAs through 1H NMR metabolomics in Porites compressa tissues from a site of high disease prevalence (Coconut Island, Hawaii). We annotated 18 metabolites through complementary 1H and 1H\u201313C heteronuclear single quantum correlation (HSQC) data that increase confidence in pathway analyses and may bolster future efforts in coral metabolite annotation. Mass of extracted metabolites was elevated in both GA and unaffected (normal tissue from a diseased colony) compared to reference (normal tissue from GA-free colony) samples, potentially indicating elevated metabolic activity in GA-afflicted colonies. Relatively high variation in metabolomic profiles among corals of the same treatment confounded data interpretation, however, analyses of paired GA and unaffected samples identified 73 features that differed between these respective metabolome types. These features were largely annotated as unknowns, but 1-methylnicotinamide and trigonelline were found to be elevated in GA samples, while betaine, glycine and histamine were lower in GA samples. Pathway analyses suggest decreased choline oxidation in GA samples, making this a pathway of interest for future targeted studies. Collectively, our results provide unique insights into GA pathophysiology by showing these lesions alter both the absolute and relative metabolism of affected colonies and by identifying features (metabolites and unknowns) and metabolic pathways of interest in GA pathophysiology going forward.",

                        "description": "<p>Coral samples were collected according to methods from<strong>[1]</strong>, a conjoining study analyzing the elemental composition of skeletons from the same samples described here. In brief, samples (approximately 4 cm in diameter) were collected by hammer and stainless-steel chisel directly north of Coconut Island at depths less than 3 m within a 1 hr period in March 2014 (State of Hawaii Division of Aquatic Resources Special Activity Permit 2011\u20131). Samples of three visually determined treatment groups were collected from individual diseased and healthy <em>P. compressa</em> colonies: coral fragments exhibiting GAs (<strong>GA</strong>, n = 15), apparently normal fragments directly adjacent to (i.e., touching) GA lesions on the same colony (<strong>unaffected</strong>, n = 15), and apparently normal fragments from the nearest, distinct, adjacent colony free of GAs (approximately 0.05\u20132 m away; <strong>reference</strong>, n = 15). In this way, a total of 45 samples were collected from 30 individual coral colonies. Samples were collected into Teflon bags and brought directly to the surface where the seawater was poured from the bags, the bags were sealed with zip ties, and frozen in liquid nitrogen (LN2) to preserve the physiological state of the samples.</p><p><br></p><p>Samples were generally processed following procedures recommended for metabolomics analysis of reef-building corals outlined by<strong>[2]</strong>. Frozen samples were transferred from LN2 and freeze-dried in a VirTis Genesis OX lyophilizer with a Wizard 2.0 controller (SP Industries Inc., Warminster USA). Subsequent sample handling time and exposure to air were limited to reduce contamination and partial rehydration of the soft tissues. In some cases, the GA lesion could not be cleanly separated from the surrounding tissues during sample collection underwater. In these cases, the GA and unaffected samples were therefore collected simultaneously as a single fragment and the GA lesions were separated from surrounding unaffected coral by hammer and stainless-steel chisel after lyophilization. Firm-bristled plastic brushes were then used to collect the dry, soft tissue powders from the coral samples by evenly brushing the entirety of each fragment (~10 s per fragment area). These powders served as the primary materials for 1H NMR analysis and were comprised of various parts of the holobiont including the coral soft tissues, symbiotic dinoflagellates, associated microbial communities, and skeletal powder incidentally removed during brushing.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>In order to preserve the limited quantities of the experimental coral tissue powders, additional <em>Orbicella faveolata</em> specimens were collected from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) coral culture facility (Permit FKNMS-2016-021 issued to Dr. Cheryl Woodley) to create in-house quality control materials. Collected samples were snap-frozen in LN2, cryohomogenized, lyophilized, aliquoted and run alongside experimental samples in order to monitor analytical reproducibility during the analysis of the<em> P. compressa</em> study samples.&nbsp;This <em>O. faveolata</em> homogenate was used to assess analytical and methodological reproducibility across batches.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1] </strong>Andersson ER, Stewart JA, Work TM, Woodley CM, Schock TB, Day RD.

                        "description": "<p class='ql-align-justify'>Samples were extracted and analyzed using 1H NMR spectroscopy in four batches on consecutive days, with each batch containing three or four randomly selected sets (paired GA and unaffected samples from the same coral colony and corresponding reference sample from an adjacent colony) of <em>Porites compressa</em> tissue powders. Each batch also consisted of a coral homogenate control material sample and blank sample to monitor for analytical reproducibility across batches and possible method contaminants, respectively.</p><p><br></p><p class='ql-align-justify'>Metabolites were extracted from the tissue powders (all samples were standardized to 100 mg \u00b1 3 mg) using methods modified from<strong>[1],[2]</strong>, as recommended for reef-building corals by<strong>[3]</strong>.&nbsp;A polar solvent system consisting of water and methanol (water:methanol ratio of 0.8:2), and a non-polar solvent system consisting of water and chloroform (water:chloroform ratio of 1:2) were used to extract metabolites from the tissue powders. This resulted in a final chloroform:methanol:water ratio of 2:2:1.8, and a total solvent volume of 1,156 \u00b5L. The chilled polar solvent system was added to every 1 mg of dry tissue powder in glass vials and were vortexed (10 s) and bath sonicated for 5 min. The chilled non-polar solvent system was then added into the glass vials and vortexed for 60 s before an additional 5 min bath sonication. The extracts were then allowed to sit on ice for 10 min before centrifugation at 2000 x g (standard acceleration due to gravity) at 4 \u00b0C for 5 min for phase separation. The polar metabolite-containing fraction of each extract was transferred using a glass pipette into a microcentrifuge tube and dried in a Vacufuge Concentrator 5301 (Eppendorf AG, Hamburg Germany) at room temperature. The mass of the dried metabolite pellet from each sample was recorded as the metabolite yield.</p><p class='ql-align-justify'><br></p><p class='ql-align-justify'>After extraction, the residual material was then placed in bleach (5.65\u20136% Laboratory Grade Sodium Hypochlorite Solution) and rotated using a Roto-Shake Genie SI-1100 (SP Scientific Inc., New York USA) for 24 h to oxidize and solubilize all remaining organics. After bleach was removed, the remaining calcium carbonate powder was then rinsed with water, dried and weighed to record the mass of non-target skeleton that contributed to the tissue powder extraction mass. The total amount of tissue extracted from each sample was then estimated by subtracting the weight of skeletal contamination from the initial weight of the tissue powder. The metabolite extract yield (metabolite extract mass by total mass of tissue extracted) was also calculated for each sample as a normalized estimate of the metabolite extract mass.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1] </strong>BLIGH EG, DYER WJ.

                        "description": "<p class='ql-align-justify'>Metrics of metabolite extraction were compared between GA, unaffected and reference samples using univariate analyses. Parametric one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) models with Tukey honestly significant difference (HSD) post-hoc tests were conducted to compare the mass of total tissue extracted, metabolite extract mass and metabolite extract yield.&nbsp;To facilitate statistical analysis of the 1H NMR metabolomics data, peaks were aligned using the Least Square method with a max shift of 0.05 ppm to correct for small variations in chemical shift across samples using NMRProcFlow v1.2<strong>[1]</strong>. An adaptive, intelligent binning procedure was subsequently performed on the spectra from 0.2\u201310 ppm with a signal-to-noise threshold equal to 3:1<strong>[2]</strong>. This procedure assigned spectral features (peaks) into bins, thereby excluding spectral noise (non-peaks) from downstream analyses. Residual water (4.7\u20135.0 ppm) and other contaminants detected in the blank sample spectra (see <strong>Table S2; Fig S3</strong> in the paper associated with this study) were precluded from binning and bins that contained only noise were removed manually. Remaining bins (330 total) were exported as data tables and normalized by metabolite extract mass (see <strong>Fig S4</strong> in the paper associated with this study) to enable relative comparisons of metabolomic profiles. For annotated features that spanned multiple bins (i.e., two bins containing both peaks of a putative doublet), statistical results were presented from a selected representative bin.</p><p class='ql-align-justify'>Multivariate analyses were conducted using Metaboanalyst 4.0<strong>[3] </strong>where bins were mean-centered and Pareto-scaled in order to decrease the dominance of bins with the largest intensities<strong>[4]</strong> prior to principal component analysis (PCA). PCAs were used to visually assess the quality of the data and to evaluate trends within and among treatment groups. Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) models were used as a supervised multivariate approach to help determine bins that differed between treatment groups that displayed divergence in PCA.</p><p class='ql-align-justify'>Predictive ability of PLS-DA models (Q2) was evaluated with a 10-fold cross validation of the first two components, and model quality was further assessed with permutation tests by group separation distance with 1000 permutations<strong>[5],[6]</strong>. Twenty sub-models were created for each PLS-DA model to evaluate reproducibility of validation metrics, and the averages were reported as iterative Q2 (cross-validation) and p-values (permutation tests). Variable importance in projection (VIP) scores were used to rank important bins and were calculated for each bin by averaging the scores of the first two components.</p><p class='ql-align-justify'>Each set of unaffected and GA samples were collected from the same coral colony; therefore, further multivariate analyses were used in order to increase resolution by focusing on unaffected-GA pairs to discount inter-colony variation. An average metabolic change vector (AMCV) was calculated from a PCA of intact unaffected-GA pairs by averaging of the difference in PCA scores between each unaffected-GA pair. The AMCV was multiplied by the PCA loadings of each bin to give a modified loadings score indicating its contribution towards the AMCV<strong>[7]</strong>. The bins that provided the largest contributions to the AMCV were determined as the inflection point of the plotted cumulative sum of the AMCV loadings (see <strong>Fig S5 </strong>in the paper associated with this study).</p><p class='ql-align-justify'>Univariate analyses were subsequently used to further elucidate patterns from multivariate approaches. Parametric one-way ANOVA models were used to compare relative intensities in 1H NMR spectra (normalized by metabolite extract mass) for all bins between all three treatments. Additionally, paired t-tests were conducted to compare all bin intensities between intact pairs of GA and unaffected samples (n = 24). Corrections to account for multiple statistical tests were used to separately adjust the p-values from the ANOVA and paired t-tests of the spectral bins, using the false discovery rate (FDR) method<strong>[8]</strong> for both corrections. Distribution normality and homoscedasticity of variables for all univariate analyses were evaluated graphically.</p><p class='ql-align-justify'>&nbsp;</p><p class='ql-align-justify'>A full spectrum annotation was conducted using a representative 1D 1H NMR spectrum and 2D 1H\u201313C HSQC spectrum from each of the three treatment groups in order to identify as many metabolites as possible in the <em>P. compressa</em> extracts. Metabolites were annotated using Chenomx NMR Suite (v8.31; Edmonton, Alberta, Canada) 700 MHz spectral libraries to match peak shape and intensity from the 1D 1H NMR spectra. Additionally, 2D 1H\u201313C HSQC data were used to match resonances from the Human Metabolome Database<strong>[9] </strong>and the Biological Magnetic Resonance Bank<strong>[10]</strong> metabolite databases to complement putative metabolite identifications from 1D annotations. Spectral features that could not be annotated with a metabolite identification were classified as unknowns. Splitting pattern, 1H and 13C chemical shifts were also recorded for identified and unknown spectral features. Annotated features were matched to the spectral bins used for statistical analyses to facilitate biological interpretations.&nbsp;</p><p class='ql-align-justify'><br></p><p class='ql-align-justify'><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p class='ql-align-justify'><strong>[1] </strong>Jacob D, Deborde C, Lefebvre M, Maucourt M, Moing A.
