Individuals were reinvestigated at the ages of 60, 70, 77, 82 and 88 years. Information collected includes a medical questionnaire, blood pressure and anthropometric measurements, glucose tolerance test and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure. Metbaolomics has been performed on plasma samples from age 70. In the final analysis we included samples from 1,138 individuals.",

Information collected includes a medical questionnaire, blood pressure and anthropometric measurements, glucose tolerance test and 24-hr ambulatory blood pressure. </p>  At age 70, EDTA-plasma, citrate-plasma, serum and whole blood for DNA extraction were collected from fasting participants and stored at -70\u00b0 C in liquid nitrogen until analysis. Additional EDTA-plasma was collected during oral glucose tolerance test. EDTA-plasma samples were used for the metabolomic profiling. Plasma samples were available for 1,138 participants at 70 years of age (1991-1994). We excluded 110 participants that experienced a CHD event before baseline, resulting in 1,028 individuals included in the current study. </p> Ref: </br> [1] Byberg L, Siegbahn A, Berglund L, McKeigue P, Reneland R, et al.

                        "description": "Raw data were processed using XCMS software [1]. Procedures to perform non-targeted metabolomics in large-population studies have been previously described by our group [2]; the code has been made publically available at https://github.com/andgan/metabolomics_pipeline. Metabolic feature detection, alignment, grouping, imputation and normalization were performed separately for each study. Each feature is characterized by a specific mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) and retention time. A single metabolite is normally represented by more than one feature. Indiscriminant (id) MS and idMS/MS spectra were generated for all the significant features [3]. Those with highly similar spectra, strong correlation and similar retention time were deemed to be from the same metabolite. We used the spectra to identify the corresponding metabolite. Four approaches were considered, in agreement with what has been suggested by the Metabolomics Standard Initiative [4]. </p> Normalization:</br> First, feature intensities were transformed to the log2 base scale to approximate normal distribution. Second, potential sample outliers were identified by plotting the total intensity for each sample. Samples with extremes total intensities might indicate sample degradation or technical errors and these samples were excluded.  Third, an ANOVA-type normalization was used to take into account factors of unwanted variation. Specifically, we fitted a linear regression for association between each feature intensity and several factors of unwanted variability. We then used the residuals from the regression as new feature intensities. The factors of unwanted variability can be identified by studying the association between several technical variables and the first principal components. In TwinGene we adjusted for the square root of the sum of the squared differences between original retention time and corrected retention time, analysis date, storage time and unknown cluster effect. Finally, feature intensities were averaged between technical duplicates to reduce the inherent instrumental variability. Features with poor correlation between duplicates were excluded.  </p> Ref: </br> [1] Smith CA, Want EJ, O\u2019Maille G, Abagyan R, Siuzdak G (2006) XCMS: processing mass spectrometry data for metabolite profiling using nonlinear peak alignment, matching, and identification.
