                "description": "Amalaki rasayana (AR), a traditional preparation is widely used by Ayurvedic physicians for the treatment of inflammatory conditions, cardiovascular diseases, cancer and for rejuvenating aged people. Metabolic alterations induced by Amalaki rasayana intervention are unknown. We aimed to investigate modulations in serum metabolomic profiles following long term oral Amalaki rasayana administration in Wistar rats. A global metabolic profiling was performed of the serum of rats administered with Amalaki rasayana or ghee+honey (GH) for 18 months and control animals which were left untreated. Amalaki rasayana components were identified from AR extract using HR-LCMS analysis. Significant reductions in prostaglandin J2, 11-dehydrothromboxane B2 and higher levels of reduced glutathione and glycitein metabolites were observed in serum of AR administered rats compared to the control groups. Pathway analysis suggest that altered metabolites in AR administered rats are those associated with different biochemical pathways of arachidonic acid metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, leukotriene metabolism, G-protein mediated events, phospholipid metabolism and the immune system. Our study identifies the AR components that induce alterations in lipid metabolism and immune pathways in animals which consume AR for a long period.",

Ion source and desolvation gas (nitrogen) temperatures were kept at 112 \u00b0C and 350 \u00b0C respectively. The sampling cone and desolvation gas flow rates were 60 l/h and 875 l/h respectively. Capillary voltage was set at 2.85 kV. Sampling cone voltage was set at 40 V. The lock mass acquisition was made every 10 secs by Leucine enkephalin (MW= 555.62) for accurate on-line mass calibration. Initially 10 QC sample runs were used for the stabilisation of the system. QC samples were then acquired after every 5th sample run.",

Three months old male Wistar rats were procured from the animal house and kept at 12 hrs day/night cycle at controlled humidity and temperature with food and water ad libitum. Animals were then divided into three groups, each group having 8 animals. Amalaki rasayana or GH (500 mg/kg, orally) was administered for 18 months to two groups of rats. One group of rats was left untreated.  Body weights were monitored on a weekly basis until the sacrifice of the animals. Body weights were recoded for all the rats on a weekly basis. At 21 months of age (after 18 months of AR administration), all the animals were sacrificed and blood samples were collected.",
