                "description": "Widely reported discrepancies between metabolic flux and transcripts or enzyme levels in bacterial metabolism imply complex regulation mechanisms need to be considered, especially in new bacterial platforms for bioremediation and bioproduction. Comamonas testosteroni strains, which metabolize various natural and xenobiotic aromatic compounds, represent such platforms whose metabolic regulations are still unknown. Here, we identify analogous multi-level regulation mechanisms in the metabolism of two lignin-related (4-hydroxybenzoate and vanillate) and one plastic-related (terephthalate) aromatic compounds in C. testosteroni KF-1, a wastewater isolate. Transcription-level regulation controlled initial catabolism and cleavage of the compounds, but subsequent carbon fluxes in central carbon metabolism are governed by metabolite-level thermodynamic regulation. Quantitative 13C-fingerprinting of tricarboxylic acid cycle and cataplerotic reactions elucidate key carbon routing that is not evident from enzyme abundance changes. Therefore, as-needed transcriptional activation of aromatic catabolism is coupled with metabolic fine-tuning of central metabolism, thus delineating pathway candidates for different metabolic manipulations.",

Cells were stored at -80 \u00b0C in nutrient-rich broth and 25% glycerol between experiments. Batch growth experiments of the bacterial strains were conducted in triplicate in an incubator (model I24; New Brunswick Scientific, Edison, NJ) set at 30 \u00b0C with shaking (220 rpm). Cells were grown on pH-adjusted (7.0) and filter-sterilized (Waters Corporation; 0.22-\u03bcm nylon filters) minimal-nutrient medium that contained the carbon substrate at 100 mM C (succinate, 4-hydroxybenzoate, vanillate, or terephthalate). The minimal-nutrient medium consisted of 5.0 mM NaH2PO4, 20 mM K2HPO4, 37 mM NH4Cl, 17 mM NaCl, 0.81 mM MgSO4.7H2O, and 34 \u03bcM CaCl2.2H2O as well as essential trace metal nutrients as previously reported<strong>[1]</strong>. Aliquots of frozen stocks were first transferred to minimal-nutrient medium in 20 ml glass tubes and grown to late exponential before transferring into 125-ml or 250-ml baffled flasks at 1/5th volume for experimental conditions. Culturing vessels were covered with sponge caps to enable gas exchange and prevent contamination. Additional washing of cells with minimal-nutrient medium to remove extracellular matrix was conducted between transfers. Cell growth was monitored on an Agilent Cary UV-visible spectrophotometer (Santa Clara, CA) at an optical density of 600 nm. The conversion factor between OD and cell dry weight in grams (gCDW) was determined by lyophilizing cell pellets throughout growth as previously described<strong>[2]</strong>. Growth rates and gCDW conversion factors were determined by regression analysis.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Aristilde L, Reed ML, Wilkes RA, Youngster T, Kukurugya MA, Katz V and Sasaki CRS (2017) Glyphosate-Induced Specific and Widespread Perturbations in the Metabolome of Soil Pseudomonas Species.

Between transfers, cells were pelleted and washed with minimal-nutrient media. During 2 points in exponential growth, an aliquot (3&nbsp;ml) of the cultures was filtered and the metabolism of the cells was immediately quenched by placing the filters in a 2-ml solution (4 \u00b0C) of methanol:acetonitrile:water (40:40:20). The supernatants with the extracted metabolites were dried under N2 after the removal of lysed cell particulates via centrifugation. Dried samples were stored at -20 \u00b0C if LC-MS analysis was conducted within 3 wk or at -80 \u00b0C if samples were stored longer than 3 wk. All of the long-term intracellular data have been deposited as derived data files (<strong>.mzXML</strong>).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Isotope and carbon switch kinetics:</strong></p><p>Cells were grown on 2 transfers of <strong>[U-13C]-succinate</strong> to obtain 13C-enriched intracellular metabolites. At mid-exponential (OD600 about 0.8-1.0) of the second transfer on <strong>[U-13C]-succinate</strong>, 1.5 ml of 13C-labeled cells were filtered on to a 0.22 \u03bcm filter, rinsed with an equal volume of sterile minimal-nutrient media, and transferred to an agar plate containing unlabeled succinate, <strong>4HB</strong>, <strong>VAN</strong>, or <strong>TER</strong> (see <strong>Fig. 12A</strong> in the paper associated with this study). Cells adhered to filters and exposed to unlabeled plates were quenched in 1 ml of cold 2:2:1 methanol:acetonitrile:water after 10 s, 30 s, 1 min, 2 min, 5 min, 15 min, and 30 min. Time zero was quenched immediately after rinsing and before transfer to a plate.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Single carbon source kinetics:</strong></p><p>Cells were grown in minimal-nutrient media containing unlabeled <strong>4HB</strong> for 2 transfers to acclimate the cells. During early-exponential (OD600 approximately 0.4-6.0) of the second transfer, an aliquot of the unlabeled cells (3 ml) was filtered, rinsed, and transferred onto minimal-nutrient agar plates containing unlabeled <strong>4HB</strong>. After cells doubled on the plates, the filter with adhered cells was transferred to agar plates containing 100% <strong>[13C6]-(phenyl)-4HB</strong> (see <strong>Fig. 12B</strong> in the paper associated with this study). At specific timepoints on the 13C-labeled plates (15 s, 1 min, 5 min, 15 min, and 30 min), the cells were quenched using the aforementioned solvent solution and the intracellular metabolites were extracted and analyzed as described above.</p><p><br></p>",
