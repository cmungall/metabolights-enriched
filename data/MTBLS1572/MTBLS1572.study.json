                "description": "Full-scan, data-dependent acquisition (DDA), and data-independent acquisition (DIA) are the three common data acquisition modes in high resolution mass spectrometry-based untargeted metabolomics. It is an important yet underrated research topic on which acquisition mode is more suitable for a given untargeted metabolomics application. In this work, we compared the three data acquisition techniques using a standard mixture of 134 endogenous metabolites and a human urine sample. Both hydrophilic interaction and reversed-phase liquid chromatographic separation along with positive and negative ionization modes were tested. Both the standard mixture and urine samples generated consistent results. Full-scan mode is able to capture the largest number of metabolic features, followed by DIA and DDA (53.7% and 64.8% respective features fewer on average in urine than full-scan). Comparing the MS2 spectra in DIA and DDA, spectra quality is higher in DDA with average dot product score 83.1% higher than DIA in Urine(H), and the number of MS2 spectra (spectra quantity) is larger in DIA (on average 97.8% more than DDA in urine). Moreover, a comparison of relative standard deviation distribution between modes shows consistency in the quantitative precision, with the exception of DDA showing a minor disadvantage (on average 19.8% and 26.8% fewer features in urine with RSD < 5% than full-scan and DIA). In terms of data preprocessing convenience, full-scan and DDA data can be processed by well-established software. In contrast, several bioinformatic issues remain to be addressed in processing DIA data and the development of more effective computational programs is highly demanded.",

The ionization source capillary voltage was set to 4.5 kV in positive scanning mode and -3 kV in negative scanning mode. The nebulizer gas pressure was set to 1.6 bar. The dry gas temperature was set to 220 \u00b0C. Absolute threshold was set to 250 cts. Collision energy was stepping from 21 eV to 45 eV. The charge state was 1. The absolute threshold was 400 cts. The cycle time was 3 seconds with the spectra rate of 8 Hz. In DDA mode, the instrument spent 30% cycle time (0.9 sec) on MS1 scanning and 70% cycle time (2.1 sec) on MS2 scanning. During MS2 scanning period, the number of precursors for MS2 spectra generation per cycle is dependent upon the cycle time, spectra rate and the intensity of the ions in MS1 spectra. As the spectra rate was 8 Hz, the time spent on scanning one spectrum was 0.125 sec. The maximum number of precursors that can be selected for MS2 spectra generation in each cycle was 16(2.1/0.125). The instrument selected the precursors in MS1 spectra for MS2 scanning from the highest intensity to the lowest until there were no more precursors available or the precursor number had reached the maximum value (16 in our case). Therefore, the number of precursor ions varied between each cycle in the whole analysis. When there were more high intensity precursors in MS1, there would be more precursors selected for MS2 scanning up to 16.&nbsp;The mass detection range was 50 to 1500 in positive mode and 65 to 1500 in negative mode.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>MS parameters in DIA mode:</strong></p><p>The mass spectrometer was operated in bbCID (broadband Collision Induced Dissociation) mode (DIA MSall mode).</p>",

The in-house library contains the accurate mass, retention time for each metabolite in the standard mixture. For urine samples, the metabolites were annotated by the publicly available MS spectral database provided by MS-DIAL. The library contains accurate mass and tandem MS information for annotation.</p><p><br></p><p>The library spectra were extracted from the database MSMS-Public-pos-VS11 and MSMS-Public-Neg-VS11 for both positive and negative acquisition modes respectively. The libraries we used were the publicly available MS spectral database provided by MS-DIAL (<a href='http://prime.psc.riken.jp/Metabolomics_Software/MS-DIAL/' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>http://prime.psc.riken.jp/Metabolomics_Software/MS-DIAL/</a>). The positive mode library includes the tandem MS information for 29,269 metabolites and the negative mode library includes the tandem MS information for 17,810 metabolites. The tandem MS information was collected from Massbank, ReSpec, GNPS, Fiehn lab, CASMI2016, MetaboBase, and RIKEN PlaSMA. The instruments used to generate the MS2 spectra are Orbitrap and Q-TOF.</p>",
