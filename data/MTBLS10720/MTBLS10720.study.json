                "description": "<p>We report identification of 3,6-dihydroxy-1,2-benzisoxazole (DHB) in a screen of Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus, whose symbiotic relationship with eukaryotic nematodes favors secondary metabolites that meet several requirements matching those for clinically useful antibiotics. DHB is produced by Photorhabdus laumondii and is selective against Gram-negative species Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Acinetobacter baumannii. It is inactive against anaerobic gut bacteria and nontoxic to human cells. Mutants resistant to DHB map to the ubiquinone biosynthesis pathway. DHB binds to 4-hydroxybenzoate octaprenyltransferase (UbiA) and prevents the formation of 4-hydroxy-3-octaprenylbenzoate. Remarkably, DHB itself is prenylated, forming an unusable chimeric product that likely contributes to the toxic effect of this antimicrobial. DHB appears to be both a competitive enzyme inhibitor and a prodrug; this dual mode of action is unusual for an antimicrobial compound.</p>",
