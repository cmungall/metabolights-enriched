                "description": "Bialaphos resistance (BAR) and phosphinothricin acetyltransferase (PAT) genes, which convey resistance to the broad-spectrum herbicide phosphinothricin (also known as glufosinate) via N-acetylation, have been globally used in basic plant research and genetically engineered crops. Although early in vitro enzyme assays showed that recombinant BAR and PAT exhibit substrate preference toward phosphinothricin over the 20 proteinogenic amino acids, indirect effects of BAR-containing transgenes in planta, including modified amino acid levels, have been seen but without the identification of their direct causes. Combining metabolomics, plant genetics, and biochemical approaches, we show that transgenic BAR indeed converts two plant endogenous amino acids, aminoadipate and tryptophan, to their respective N-acetylated products in several plant species examined. We report the crystal structures of BAR, and further delineate structural basis for its substrate selectivity and catalytic mechanism. Through structure-guided protein engineering, we generated several BAR variants that display significantly reduced nonspecific activities compared to its wild-type counterpart in vivo. Our results demonstrate that transgenic expression of enzymes can result in unintended off-target metabolism arising from enzyme promiscuity. Understanding of such phenomena at the mechanistic level can facilitate the design of maximally insulated systems featuring heterologously expressed enzymes.",

Stock solutions of aminoadipate and tryptophan at 60 mM were made in 2 mM Tris-HCl pH 8 supplemented with 1 mM N-nonyl beta-D-glucopyranoside and substrate concentration-dependence assays employing these two substrates contained 0.33 mM N-nonyl beta-D-glucopyranoside.

Substrate concentration-dependences toward phosphinothricin, aminoadipate and tryptophan were determined for the BAR mutants Y92F and N35T in 2 mM Tris-HCl pH 8 and 10 mM acetyl-CoA (Sigma-Aldrich). Note that assays on aminoadipate and tryptophan were supplemented with 0.33 mM of N-nonyl beta-D-glucopyranoside (see also above). Reactions were stopped by the addition of 4 volumes of 10% water, 90% acetonitrile (v/v), 5 mM ammonium formate pH 3, centrifuged for 2 min (14,000-16,000 x g), and transferred to LC vials.\n</p>\nStandards were prepared in 80% methanol, 20% water.

Data analysis was performed with Xcalibur (Thermo Scientific). Note that values for a few amino acids are shown as relative levels in Supplementary Fig. 2 of the paper associated with this study, because their concentrations in some samples were more than 10-fold higher than the highest concentration of the standard.
