                "description": "Sub-Saharan Africa currently experiences an unprecedented wave of urbanization, which has important consequences for health and disease patterns. This study aimed to investigate and integrate the immune and metabolic consequences of rural or urban lifestyles and the role of nutritional changes associated with urban living. In a cohort of 323 healthy Tanzanians, urban as compared to rural living was associated with a pro-inflammatory immune phenotype, both at the transcript and protein levels. We identified different food-derived and endogenous circulating metabolites accounting for these differences. Serum from urban dwellers induced reprogramming of innate immune cells with higher tumor necrosis factor production upon microbial re-stimulation in an in vitro model of trained immunity. These data demonstrate important shifts toward an inflammatory phenotype associated with an urban lifestyle and provide new insights into the underlying dietary and metabolic factors, which may affect disease epidemiology in sub-Sahara African countries.",

A total of 323 Tanzanian healthy individuals aged between 18-65 years residing within the Kilimanjaro region in Northern Tanzania were enrolled between March and December 2017, at the Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Center and Lucy Lameck Research Center, in Moshi municipality. Moshi city is the administrative, commercial and educational center of the Kilimanjaro region with over 200,000 inhabitants and 6 higher education institutions. Due to this regional function, there is substantial diversity in ethnic groups, economic status and lifestyle, whereby most inhabitants have adopted a western lifestyle. People residing in the Moshi municipality (urban zone) have access to good sanitation with universal coverage of chlorinated tap water and toilet facilities. In contrast, people we designated as living in rural conditions represent the rural population of Tanzania; people live within large family units, whereby the economy depends mainly on subsistence farming and animal husbandry. Most individuals in the rural area belong to the Chagga tribe and follow a traditional lifestyle, whereby using a pit latrine and consumption of a starch and vegetable diet are common. They also have access to good sanitation and water primarily from the slope of Mount Kilimanjaro or from wells. We enrolled individuals from both urban and rural zones with a higher number from urban zones to correct for the higher genetic diversity.</p><p><br></p><p>Collected blood plasma for metabolomics was transported to General Metabolics, LLC (Boston, USA) on dry ice.</p>",

The flow rate was 150 \u03bcl/min of mobile phase consisting of isopropanol/water (60:40, v/v) buffered with 5 mM ammonium carbonate at pH 9 for negative mode and methanol/water (60:40, v/v) with 0.1% formic acid at pH 3 for positive mode. For online mass axis correction, 2-propanol (in the mobile phase), taurocholic acid, and hexakis(1H, 1H, 3H-tetrafluoropropoxy)phosphazine (HP-0921, Agilent Technologies) for negative mode and creatinine, reserpine, and HP-0921 for positive mode were added to the mobile phase.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Fuhrer T, Heer D, Begemann B, Zamboni N.

                        "description": "<p>A list of putative metabolites was annotated with a series of analysis strategy, including deisotoping, decluttering, adduct detection and library matching in <strong>KEGG</strong> (<a href='https://www.genome.jp/kegg/' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>https://www.genome.jp/kegg/</a>), human metabolic database (<strong>HMDB</strong>) (<a href='https://www.hmdb.ca/' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>https://www.hmdb.ca/</a>) and <strong>ChEBI</strong> (<a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/</a>) as previously described<strong>[1]</strong>. Briefly, starting from the summed formulas of the metabolites contained in <strong>HMDB</strong>, the monoisotopic mass for the neutral molecule was calculated, and common ESI ions/adducts for the monoisotopic masses and isotopes were generated. For each measured ion, we searched for possible hits among all theoretical ion masses within a tolerance of 0.003 amu.</p><p><br></p><p>The resulting peak intensity data table was then uploaded in <strong>MetaboAnalyst v.4.0</strong> and comprehensive metabolomics data analysis was performed as per existing protocols<strong>[2]</strong>. In brief, data were uploaded as peak intensity table (MS peak list data) in comma-separated values (<strong>.csv</strong>) format. A data matrix of 323 individual samples and 1,601 compounds/metabolites (peaks (mz/rt)) were uploaded in a column and a row respectively. Data were normalized by generalized log transformation (<strong>glog2</strong>) and Pareto scaling. PCA was applied to check for outliers and 3 potential outliers were excluded from further analysis. Differences in compounds/metabolites between rural and urban dwellers were analyzed using <strong>Student\u2019s t-tests</strong>. Metabolic pathway analysis, which combines functional enrichment analysis and network topology analysis was performed on the list of compound labels (common names) to help identify metabolic pathways that were most likely associated with the different inflammatory profiles among rural and urban-living individuals. Over-representation analysis was performed using a hypergeometric test, whereas pathway topology analysis was performed using relative-betweenness centrality. Associated pathways were visualized and explored via a Google-map-style interactive visualization framework. PCA was performed and groups were further presented in PCA space by ellipses, calculated by the extension function <strong>stat_ellipse</strong> provided by <strong>ggplot2 (v.3.3.2)</strong> setting the level at 0.95 and by adjacent density histograms.</p><p><br></p><p>To further investigate the contribution of dietary habits to the immunofunctional changes observed among urban individuals recruited during the dry versus wet seasons, we performed a selection of only food-derived metabolites based on the ontology given in the <strong>HMDB</strong>. A total of 293 food-derived metabolites were selected and further explored for their contribution to the immune functional changes. Data were normalized by generalized log transformation (<strong>glog2</strong>) and Pareto scaling using <strong>MetaboAnalyst</strong> and further analyses were performed in R. PCA of urban cohort food-derived metabolome was performed and the quality of representation for metabolites on the factor map was presented by <strong>cos2 value</strong>, using the <strong>get_pca_var</strong> function from the <strong>factoextra package (v.1.0.7)</strong>. Definition and visualization of metabolic clusters in the urban cohort was conducted by agglomerative hierarchical clustering on the food-derived metabolome by setting the Euclidean distance calculation and using the <strong>ward.D2 linkage</strong> algorithm in the <strong>pheatmap</strong> function (<strong>pheatmap v.1.0.12</strong>)</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Fuhrer T, Heer D, Begemann B, Zamboni N.
