                "description": "Obesity is tightly linked to hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance. One feature of this association is the paradox of selective insulin resistance: insulin fails to suppress hepatic gluconeogenesis but activates lipid synthesis in the liver. How lipid accumulation interferes selectively with some branches of hepatic insulin signaling is not well understood. Here we provide a resource, based on unbiased approaches and established in a simple cell culture system, to enable investigations of the phenomenon of selective insulin resistance. We analyzed the phosphoproteome of insulin treated human hepatoma cells and identified sites in which palmitate selectively impairs insulin signaling. As an example, we show that palmitate interferes with insulin signaling to FoxO1, a key transcription factor regulating gluconeogenesis, and identify a possible mechanism. This model system, together with our comprehensive characterization of the proteome, phosphoproteome, and lipidome changes in response to palmitate treatment, provides a novel and useful resource for unraveling the mechanisms underlying selective insulin resistance.",

Then, HPLC-grade water, methanol, and chloroform were added to each vial, generating a final chloroform/methanol/water (C/M/W) ratio of 1:2:0.8 (v/v/v). Samples were vortexed vigorously for 5 min, and centrifuged for 10 min at 1,800x g at room temperature. After centrifugation, the supernatants were collected and transferred to fresh vials, and the remaining pellets were dried under nitrogen stream. The dry pellets were extracted with chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v), centrifuged, and the resulting supernatants were combined with the corresponding supernatants from the first step of extraction (C/M/W 1:2:0.8 v/v/v). The combined supernatants were dried under nitrogen stream, and the resulting samples were submitted to Folch\u2019s partitioning by dissolving them in C/M/W (4:2:1.5, v/v/v), followed by vortexing and centrifuging, as described above. After centrifugation, the lower (organic) and upper (aqueous) phases were separated, and transferred to fresh Pyrex glass test tubes. The Folch upper phase was then re-extracted with C/M (2/1; v/v), and the resulting organic phase was combined with the organic phase from the preceding step. The pooled organic phases were dried under a N2 stream, and stored at -20 \u00b0C until use.\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Gazos-Lopes, F., Oliveira, M. M., Hoelz, L. V., Vieira, D. P., Marques, A.

The eluent A consisted of acetonitrile/water (50:50 v/v) + 10 mM ammonium formate and 0.2% formic acid, and the eluent B consisted of methanol/isopropanol/water (10:88:20 v/v/v) + 2 mM ammonium formate and 0.01 % formic acid. The following program was used for gradient elution of analytes (total run time of 46 min) at a constant flow rate of 500 ml/min. 35% eluent B \u2013 45% eluent B over 5 min, 45% eluent B \u2013 85% eluent B from min 5 \u2013 min 28, 85% eluent B \u2013 100% eluent B from min 28 \u2013 min 38, followed by an immediate drop back to 35% eluent B, which is held constant up to min 46 of each run.

The following parameters were used for batch analysis: Database \u2013 Q Exactive; Search Type \u2013 Product; Experiment Type (Exp Type) - LC-MS; Parent Tolerance (Parent Tol) - 0.1 Da; NL/Prec Tol \u2013 0.5 Da; Precursor Tolerance (Prec Tol) - 10.0 ppm; Product Tolerance (15.0) ppm; Merge Range (Min) - 0.0; Minimal Peak Width (min) - 0.0; Threshold Type - Relative; Product Ion \u2013 1.0%; m-score threshold \u2013 2.0; Recalculate Isotope \u2013 ON; R.T. Interval (min) - 0.01; Execute Quantitation \u2013 ON; m/z Tolerance (m/z tol) -  -10.0/+10.0; Tolerance Type \u2013 ppm; R.T. range (min) -  -0.05/+0.05; Toprank filter \u2013 ON; Main Node Filter \u2013 Main Isomer Peak; m-Score Threshold (Display) - 5.0; C-Score Threshold (Display) - 2.0; Fatty Acid Priority (FA Priority) - ON; ID Quality Filter (A; B; C). The following parameters were used for sample alignment: Search Type \u2013 Product; Experiment Type (ExpType) - LC\u2013MS; Alignment Method \u2013 Max; R.T. Tolerance \u2013 0.25; Calculate Unassigned Peak Area \u2013 ON; Filter Type \u2013 New Filter; Toprank Filter \u2013ON; Main Node Filter \u2013 Main Isomer Peak; m-score threshold \u2013 5.0; ID Quality \u2013 A,B,C. Because this study required a careful comparison between the lipid composition of T. cruzi and its host cells, all lipid species identified using the LipidSearchTM software were manually curated after computational analysis, being either accepted, rejected, or reassigned.\n</p>\nKnown quantities of each lipid standard were analyzed using the same UHPLC-ESIMS/MS methods to generate a response factor (RF; peak area/pmol standard injected). The RF for each standard was divided by the CerG1 RF to calculate a molar relative response factor (MRRF) for each major lipid class. The MRRF for each class was normalized to the CerG1 peak area of each sample, and peak areas adjusted accordingly. Only those classes for which standards were detected in each run were considered for analysis. The in-built statistical tool for the quantitation of lipid species LipidSearchTM is student t-test. For the calculation of lipid class fatty acid composition, the MainArea values output by LipidSearch\u2122 were assigned to each FA moiety of a given species and summed using Microsoft Excel PivotTable. Area % is the summed FA value divided by the lipid class total, multiplied by 100 to reflect percentage within each lipid\nclass.",
