                "description": "<p>Maintaining the health of seafarers is a difficult task during long-term voyages. Little is known about the corresponding changes in the gut microbiome-host interaction. This study recruited 30 seafarers undertaking a 6-month voyage and analyzed their gut microbiota using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Fecal untargeted metabolomics analysis was performed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Significant changes in the composition of the gut microbiota and an increased ratio of <em>Firmicutes</em>/<em>Bacteroidetes</em> at the end (day 180) of the 6-month voyage, relative to the start (day 0), were observed. At the genus level, the abundances of <em>Holdemanella</em> and <em>Plesiomonas</em> were significantly increased, while the abundance of <em>Bacteroides</em> was decreased. Predicted microbial functional analysis revealed significant decreases in folate biosynthesis and biotin metabolism. Furthermore, 20 differential metabolites within six differentially enriched human metabolic pathways (including arginine biosynthesis, lysine degradation, phenylalanine metabolism, sphingolipid metabolism, pentose and glucuronate interconversions, and glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism) were identified by comparing the fecal metabolites at day 0 and day 180. Spearman correlation analysis revealed close relationships between the 14 differential microbiota members and the six differential fecal metabolites that might affect specific human metabolic pathways. This study adopted a multi-omics approach and provides potential targets for maintaining the health of seafarers during long-term voyages. These findings are worthy of more in-depth exploration in future studies.</p><p><strong>IMPORTANCE:</strong> Maintaining the health of seafarers undertaking long-term voyages is a difficult task. Apart from the alterations in the gut microbiome and fecal metabolites after a long-term voyage, our study also revealed that 20 differential metabolites within six differentially enriched human metabolic pathways are worthy of attention. Moreover, we found close relationships between the 14 differential microbiota members and the six differential fecal metabolites that might impact specific human metabolic pathways. Accordingly, preventative measures, such as adjusting the gut microbiota by decreasing potential pathobionts or increasing potential probiotics as well as offsetting the decrease in B vitamins and beneficial metabolites (e.g., d-glucuronic acid and citrulline) via dietary adjustment or nutritional supplements, might improve the health of seafarers during long-term sea voyages. These findings provide valuable clues about gut microbiome-host interactions and propose potential targets for maintaining the health of seafarers engaged in long-term sea voyages.</p>",

Informed consent was obtained from each subject, and the study protocol was performed in accordance with the ethical guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki. In total, 30 participants were enrolled in this study. All participants were male, aged 18 to 35 yr, and were participating in a sea voyage lasting 6 mth. The voyage occurred from 12 June to 27 December 2017. During the voyage, there was a uniform supply of food and drink. The standard diet was $30 per day and included frozen meat, vegetables, fruits, and canned food, etc. The ship docked on average once every 2 wk to replenish the supply of fresh food and drinks. Due to storage problems, the supply of fresh vegetables and fruit was limited. The seafarers were housed in small closed rooms on the ship; each room was approximately 10 m^2 and housed 6 seafarers. Fresh fecal samples were collected from all participants for LC-MS untargeted metabolomic analysis. All participants were healthy.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Fecal sample collection:</strong></p><p>27 fecal samples were collected at day=0 (before the voyage) and 20 fecal samples were collected at day=180 (after the voyage) using sterile sampling tubes. The samples were stored at 280 \u00b0C in a freezer for LC-MS untargeted metabolomics analysis.</p>",
