                "description": "<p>Background: Grafting with the dwarf rootstock is an efficient method to control the plant height in fruit production. However, the molecular mechanism is still unclear. Our previous study showed that the plants with Prunus mume rootstock exhibit a considerable reduction in plant height, internode length and number of nodes compared with Prunus persica rootstock. The present study aimed to investigate the mechanism behind the regulation of plant height by \u2018P. mume\u2019 rootstocks through transcriptome and metabolomic analysis with two grafting combinations, \u2018Longyan/Mume\u2019 and \u2018Longyan/Peach\u2019.&nbsp;</p><p>Results: The findings of the study indicate a significant decrease in brassinolide levels in plants that were grafted onto \u2018P. mume\u2019 rootstocks. Plant hormone signal transduction and brassinolide production metabolism gene expression also changed significantly. Flavonoid levels, amino acid and fatty acid metabolites, and energy metabolism in dwarf plants decreased in the research. The present work observed a notable upregulation of PmLBD3 gene expression in plant specimens that were subjected to grafting onto \u2018P. mume\u2019 rootstocks. Auxin signaling cues promote PmARF3 transcription, which directly controls this upregulation. Through its binding to PmBAS1 and PmSAUR36 gene promoters, PmLBD3 promotes endogenous brassinolide inactivation and inhibits cell proliferation.&nbsp;</p><p>Conclusions: Auxin signaling and brassinolide levels are linked by PmLBD3. Our findings showed that PmLBD3 is a key transcription factor that regulates the balance of hormones through the auxin and brassinolide signalling pathways and caused dwarf plants in stone fruits.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Root analysis</strong>&nbsp;is reported in the current study&nbsp;<a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS10051' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS10051</strong></a>.</p><p><strong>Leaf analysis</strong>&nbsp;is reported in&nbsp;<a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS10083' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS10083</strong></a>.</p><p><strong>Stem analysis</strong>&nbsp;is reported in&nbsp;<a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS10062' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS10062</strong></a>.</p>",

The \u2018P. mume\u2019 rootstock \u2018Lve\u2019 comes from commercial production of 1-year cuttings purchased from Xinyi Green Golden Flower and Wood Professional Cooperative (Xuzhou, China); the \u2018P. persica\u2019 rootstock \u2018Zhongtaokangzhen No.1\u2019 is an annual cutting seedling from the Zhengzhou Institute of Fruit Trees, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (Zhengzhou, China). The plants were grown in a normal greenhouse using plastic pots with a diameter of 25 cm that were filled with a mixture of soil, sand and peat in a ratio of 1:1:3. In March, scions from 9-year-old \u2018Longyan\u2019 trees were taken and grafted at a height of 30 cm onto 1-year-old \u2018P. mume\u2019 and \u2018P. persica\u2019 rootstocks. The root grafting interfaces were taken at the following timepoint (125 Days), immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, pooled and stored at -80 \u00b0C until analysis. Take 6 independent plants from each tissue as biological replicates. LC-MS/MS analysis was conducted by Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI) (Shenzhen, China).</p>",

In combination with the raw data, individual compound mass spectra were reconstructed and features annotated as cluster ion, quasimolecular ion or insource fragment ion. Afterwards, targeted CID-MS/MS experiments of quasimolecular ions (MS2) were performed using QTOF-MS. Based on accurate mass measurements, putative elemental compositions were calculated, filtered by isotope abundance and the number of double bond equivalents and electron parity, and checked for consistency in relation to elemental compositions calculated for fragment ions and observed neutral losses. Identification was based on reference spectra in MassBank (MSI Level 2 and 3), and in some cases on authentic standards (MSI Level 1).</p>",
