                "description": "<p>Isoproterenol (ISO) provides a simple and non-invasive method for inducing myocardial injury with lower mortality and higher reproducibility. Phlegm-damp syndrome, as known as \u201cTanshi\u201d in Chinese, is one of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) syndrome differentiation, which plays an important role in the development of cardiovascular diseases. However, the underlying mechanism remains unknown. In our present study, a myocardial injury mouse model was introduced by ISO administration combined with high temperature and high humidity and high fat diet to simulate phlegm-damp syndrome. Nontargeted metabolomics with LC-MS/MS was adopted to reveal serum metabolism profile for elucidating the possible molecular mechanism.</p>",

Precusor tolerance was set 5 ppm, fragment tolerance was set 10 ppm, and retention time (RT) tolerance was set 0.02 min. Internal standard detection parameters were deselected for peak RT alignment, isotopic peaks were excluded for analysis, and noise elimination level was set at 10.00, minimum intensity was set to 15 % of base peak intensity. The <strong>Excel </strong>file was obtained with 3 dimension data sets including m/z, peak RT and peak intensities, and RT\u2013m/z pairs were used as the identifier for each ion. The resulting matrix was further reduced by removing any peaks with missing value (ion intensity = 0) in more than 50 % samples. The internal standard was used for data QC (reproducibility). Metabolites were identified by <strong>progenesis QI</strong> (Waters Corporation, Milford, USA) Data Processing Software, based on public databases such as <a href='http://www.hmdb.ca/' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>http://www.hmdb.ca/</a>; <a href='http://www.lipidmaps.org/' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>http://www.lipidmaps.org/</a> and self-built databases. The positive and negative data were combined to get a combine data which was imported into <strong>R<em> </em></strong><em>'ropls'</em> package. Principle component analysis (PCA) and (orthogonal) partial least-squares-discriminant analysis (O)PLS-DA were carried out to visualize the metabolic alterations among experimental groups, after mean centering (Ctr) and Pareto variance (Par) scaling, respectively. The Hotelling\u2019s T2 region, shown as an ellipse in score plots of the models, defines the 95% confidence interval of the modelled variation. Variable importance in the projection (VIP) ranks the overall contribution of each variable to the OPLS-DA model, and those variables with VIP &gt; 1 are considered relevant for group discrimination. In this study, the default 7-round cross-validation was applied with 1/seventh of the samples being excluded from the mathematical model in each round, in order to guard against overfitting. The differential metabolites were selected on the basis of the combination of a statistically significant threshold of variable influence on projection (VIP) values obtained from the OPLS- DA model and p values from a two-tailed Student\u2019s t test on the normalized peak areas, where metabolites with VIP values larger than 1.0 and p values less than 0.05 were considered as differential metabolites.</p>",
