                "description": "The overconsumption of carbohydrates induces oxidative stress and lipid accumulation in the liver, which can be alleviated by modulation of intestinal microbiota; however, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we demonstrated that a strain affiliated with <i>Lactobacillus plantarum</i> (designed as MR1) efficiently attenuated lipid deposition, oxidative stress, as well as inflammatory response, which are caused by high-carbohydrate diet (HC) in fish with poor utilization ability of carbohydrates. Serum untargeted metabolome analysis indicated that pyrimidine metabolism was the significantly changed pathway among the groups. In addition, the content of serum uridine was significantly decreased in the HC group compared with the control group, while it increased by supplementation with <i>L. plantarum</i> MR1. Further analysis showed that addition of <i>L. plantarum</i> MR1 reshaped the composition of gut microbiota and increased the content of intestinal acetate. In vitro experiment showed that sodium acetate could induce the synthesis of uridine in hepatocytes. Furthermore, we proved that uridine could directly ameliorate oxidative stress and decrease liver lipid accumulation in the hepatocytes. In conclusion, this study indicated that probiotic <i>L. plantarum</i> MR1 ameliorated high-carbohydrate diet-induced hepatic lipid accumulation and oxidative stress by increasing the circulating uridine, suggesting that intestinal microbiota can regulate the metabolism of nucleotides to maintain host physiological homeostasis.",

This study was approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of East China Normal University (F20190101).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Bacteria isolation and diet preparation</strong></p><p>134 bacterial isolates were purified from the gut of healthy <strong>Nile tilapia</strong> and cultured at 28 \u00b0C in MRS broth medium (BS1137, Basebio). 12 clusters were classified according to the amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA) as the previous study described.54 The strain with an outstanding potency in production of acetate and resistance to bile salt was selected and designated as MR1. The genomic DNA of MR1 was extracted by using a bacterial DNA kit (DP302, Tiangen) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. The 16S rRNA gene of MR1 was amplified using primers 27F (5\u2019-AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3\u2019) and 1492R (5\u2019-GGTTACCTTGTTACGACTT-3\u2019). The PCR was performed using the following program: 94 \u00b0C for 5 min; 30 cycles at 94\u00b0C for 30 s, 55\u00b0C for 30 s and 72 \u00b0C for 90 s; and 72 \u00b0C for 10 min. The 16S rRNA gene was sequenced by Majorbio Bio-Pharm Technology Co. Ltd and blasted in GenBank (<a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/</a>). The 16S rRNA gene sequence of MR1 was affiliated to Lactobacillus plantarum and submitted to NCBI GenBank with the accession number: OM535884. L. plantarum MR1 was cultured at 28 \u00b0C in MRS agar medium (BS1138, Basebio) under anaerobic conditions using the Anaeropack (Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Company, Inc., Japan) for 16 h. The bacterial quantity was determined by serial dilution and counting on MRS agar plate. Stock of L. plantarum MR1 was mixed with glycerol, and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Animal experiments</strong></p><p><strong>Nile tilapia</strong> juveniles were obtained from Shanghai Ocean University (Shanghai, China). All fish were acclimated at 28 \u00b0C and fed with a commercial diet twice per day for 2 wks. After acclimation, 270 similar-sized fish at 1.66 (\u00b10.05) g were randomly distributed into three groups (3 replicates for each group, 40 fish per replicate) &nbsp;and fed with a <strong>normal control diet (NC)</strong>, a <strong>high-carbohydrate diet (HC) </strong>or a <strong>high-carbohydrate diet supplemented with L. plantarum MR1 (HCL) </strong>for 10 weeks. All fish were fed twice daily at 5% body weight. The formulations of the diets were listed in <strong>Table S2 </strong>in the paper associated with this study. The total weight of fish in each tank was recorded every 2 wks. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Sampling collection</strong></p><p>Before the sampling, fish were fasted for 12 h. 9 fish from each treatment were anesthetized by eugenol tranquilizers at 20 mg/L. <strong>Blood </strong>was collected from the caudal vein and centrifuged for <strong>serum</strong> preparation (3,500\u00d7g for 10 min). The <strong>serum </strong>was immediately frozen at \u221280 \u00b0C for further analysis. Tissue samples were collected to perform biochemical and molecular biological assays. </p>",

After filtering, minimum metabolite values were imputed for specific samples in which the metabolite levels fell below the lower limit of quantitation and each Metabolic features were normalized by sum. The internal standard was used for data QC (reproducibility), Metabolic features which the relative standard deviation (RSD) of QC&gt;30% were discarded. Following normalization procedures and imputation, statistical analysis was performed on log transformed data to identify significant differences in metabolite levels between comparable groups. Mass spectra of these metabolic features were identified by using the accurate mass, MS/MS fragments spectra and isotope ratio difference with searching in reliable biochemical databases as Human metabolome database (<strong>HMDB</strong>) (<a href='http://www.hmdb.ca/' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>http://www.hmdb.ca/</a>) and <strong>Metlin </strong>database (<a href='https://metlin.scripps.edu/' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>https://metlin.scripps.edu/</a>). Concretely, the mass tolerance between the measured m/z values and the exact mass of the components of interest was \u00b110 ppm. For metabolites having MS/MS confirmation, only the ones with MS/MS fragments score above 30 were considered as confidently identified. Otherwise, metabolites had only tentative assignments.&nbsp;</p><p>Statistically significant among groups were selected with VIP value more than 1 and p value less than 0.05. Differential metabolites among three groups were summarized, and mapped into their biochemical pathways through metabolic enrichment and pathway analysis based on database search (<strong>KEGG</strong>,<a href=' http://www. genome.jp/kegg/' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'> http://www. genome.jp/kegg/</a>). These metabolites can be classified according to the pathways they involved or the functions they performed. Enrichment analysis was usually to analyze a group of metabolites in a function node whether appears or not. The principle was that the annotation analysis of a single metabolite develops into an annotation analysis of a group of metabolites. <strong>scipy.stats </strong>(<strong>Python </strong>packages)(<a href='https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/ ' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/ </a>) was exploited to identify statistically significantly enriched pathway using Fisher\u2019s exact test.&nbsp;</p>",
