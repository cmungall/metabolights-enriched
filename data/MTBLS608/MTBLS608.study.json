                "title": "Metabolic characterization of directly reprogrammed renal tubular epithelial cells (iRECs)",
                "description": "Fibroblasts can be directly reprogrammed to induced renal tubular epithelial cells (iRECs) using four transcription factors. These engineered cells may be used for disease modeling, cell replacement therapy or drug and toxicity testing. Direct reprogramming induces drastic changes in the transcriptional landscape, protein expression, morphological and functional properties of cells. However, how the metabolome is changed by reprogramming and to what degree it resembles the target cell type remains unknown. Using untargeted gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and targeted liquid chromatography-MS, we characterized the metabolome of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), iRECs, mIMCD-3 cells, and whole kidneys. Metabolic fingerprinting can distinguish each cell type reliably, revealing iRECs are most similar to mIMCD-3 cells and clearly separate from MEFs used for reprogramming. Treatment with the cytotoxic drug cisplatin induced typical changes in the metabolic profile of iRECs commonly occurring in acute renal injury. Interestingly, metabolites in the medium of iRECs, but not of mIMCD-3 cells or fibroblast could distinguish treated and non-treated cells by cluster analysis. In conclusion, direct reprogramming of fibroblasts into renal tubular epithelial cells strongly influences the metabolome of engineered cells, suggesting that metabolic profiling may aid in establishing iRECs as in vitro models for nephrotoxicity testing in the future.",

Virus concentrate was diluted 1:1000 to 1:100 in MEFM containing 8 \u00b5g/ml Polybrene (sc-134220). Cells were incubated for 12 h on 7 consecutive days. 14 days after the last viral transduction GFP-positive cells were sorted using a BD FACSAria Fusion flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). Afterwards, the cells were expanded in MEFM (Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), 2 mM L-glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS)).

All 3 cell lines were grown in MEFM containing DMEM High Glucose (4.5 g/l). Medium was changed on a daily basis; the medium for metabolomic analysis was incubated on cells for 24 h before harvesting. For cisplatin exposure, all 3 cell lines were incubated in MEFM containing 6 \u00b5l/ml cisplatin for 24 h (Cisplatin stock solution 0.1 mg/ml, Apotheke des Universit\u00e4tsklinikums Freiburg).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Kaminski MM, Tosic J, Kresbach C, Engel H, Klockenbusch J, M\u00fcller AL, Pichler R, Grahammer F, Kretz O, Huber TB, Walz G, Arnold SJ, Lienkamp SS.

Chromatographic separation was performed using an HP5-MS column (5%-diphenyl-95%-dimethylpolysiloxane, 60 m x 0.25 mm x 0.25 \u03bcm). The gradient was 80 \u00b0C hold for 3 min, to 320 \u00b0C with 5 \u00b0C/min and hold for 14 min.

The column temperature was set to 40 \u00b0C. 2 targeted methods were applied: 1 targeting amino acids, the other targeting intermediates of glycolysis and the TCA-cycle. Buffer A consisted of 10 mM NH4CH3CO2 pH 9 acetonitrile/water 20/80 and buffer B of 10 mM NH4CH3CO2 pH 9 acetonitrile/water 95/5.

Separating intermediates of glycolysis and the TCA-cycle was achieved by the following program: 99.9% B hold for 1 min, to 30% B until 5 min, to 25% B until 5.5 min hold until 8.5 min, to 99.9% B until 9 min and hold until 14 min.
