                "description": "<p>Animals and their associated microbiota share long evolutionary histories. However, it is not always clear how host genotype and microbiota interact to affect phenotype. We applied a hologenomic approach to explore how host-microbiota interactions shape lifetime growth and parasite infection in farmed Atlantic salmon (<em>Salmo salar</em>). Multi-omics data sets were generated from the guts of 460 salmon, 82% of which were naturally infected with an intestinal cestode. A single <em>Mycoplasma</em> bacterial strain, MAG01, dominated the gut metagenome of large, non-parasitized fish, consistent with previous studies showing high levels of <em>Mycoplasma</em> in the gut microbiota of healthy salmon. While small and/or parasitized salmon also had high abundance of MAG01, we observed increased alpha diversity in these individuals, driven by increased frequency of low-abundance <em>Vibrionaceae</em> and other <em>Mycoplasma</em> species that carried known virulence genes. Colonization by one of these cestode-associated <em>Mycoplasma</em> strains was associated with host individual genomic variation in long non-coding RNAs. Integrating the multi-omic data sets revealed coordinated changes in the salmon gut mRNA transcriptome and metabolome that correlated with shifts in the microbiota of smaller, parasitized fish. Our results suggest that the gut microbiota of small and/or parasitized fish is in a state of dysbiosis that partly depends on the host genotype, highlighting the value of using a hologenomic approach to incorporate the microbiota into the study of host-parasite dynamics.</p>",

This cohort has been described previously<strong>[1]</strong>. Briefly, we sampled 460 ready-to-harvest Atlantic salmon from a commercial production site close to Bergen, Norway, owned by Ler\u00f8y Seafood Group during April 2018. Samples were obtained from 2 groups reared in separate sea pens and fed 2 different standard commercial diets ('Feed1' and 'Feed2'). These diets have been anonymised but were manufactured respectively by BioMar and EWOS in 2018. For Feed1, salmon were fed BioMar\u2019s 'Energy X' from sea transfer until they were 1 kg in weight, 'Power 1000' from 1 to 2.5 kg and 'Power 2500' from 2.5 kg to slaughter. For Feed2, salmon were fed 'EWOS Rapid' from sea transfer until they were 1 kg in weight and 'EWOS Extra' from 1 kg to slaughter. A number of relevant metadata variables describing various phenotypes of each fish were recorded (Table S16 in the paper associated with this study), including gutted weight (kg) and intestinal cestode infection status using a cestode index from 0 to 3 where: 0 = no observed cestode; 1 = one to three visible cestodes; 2 = more than three cestodes but digesta volume was higher than cestode volume in the gastrointestinal tract; and 3 = excessive numbers of cestodes dominating the gastrointestinal volume that were likely impeding the passage of feed along the gastrointestinal tract. Fish were further binned into size classes (small, medium and large) based on gutted weight and cestode detection classes (present, absent) using the above-mentioned cestode index. We used a linear model to test for significant differences (p &lt; 0.05) between gutted weight and cestode index, including feed type as a covariate. We used Fisher\u2019s Exact Test to compare frequency of cestode detection between the 2 feed types.</p><p><br></p><p>A total of 6 biological samples were taken from each fish, including muscle tissue for fatty acid profiling, gill tissue for host genomics, gut epithelia for host transcriptomics, gut epithelial cell scrapes for 16S metabarcoding and 2 gut content samples for metagenomics and metabolomics. We also sampled 10 feed pellets for each feed type and characterised their microbiota using 16S metabarcoding. Approximately 100 mg distal gut content for each individual was sampled for metabolomics. Gut content for metabolomics was preserved at -80 \u00b0C. All the sampling tools and equipment used for each sample were sterile.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Brealey JC, Lecaudey LA, Kodama M, Rasmussen JA, Sveier H, Dheilly NM, Martin MD, Limborg MT.

                        "description": "<p>ThermoFisher Scientific UHPLC-Orbitrap-MS/MS RAW files were converted into mzML files using ProteoWizard<strong>[1]</strong>. For an increased deciphering of molecular spectres, MZmine2<strong>[2][3]</strong> was applied for mass detection of MS1 and MS2 spectres, followed by chromatogram detection and deconvolution. Subsequently, detected isotopes and features were grouped according to a tolerance of mass charges (5 ppm for m/z) and retention time (6 s) and the features were further aligned according to retention time and m/z. Lastly, only features with a MS2 spectrum were kept for further substructural analysis and in silico analysis.</p><p><br></p><p>A molecular network was created using the feature-based molecular networking (FBMN) workflow on the Global Natural Product Social Molecular Networking (GNPS) platform<strong>[4][5]</strong> combined with SIRIUS4 and CSI:FingerID<strong>[6][7]</strong> as previously described for fish intestinal metabolomics<strong>[8]</strong>. In brief, to enhance identification of unknown metabolites, unsupervised substructures were discovered using MS2LDA<strong>[9][10]</strong> and MS2 spectra were annotated in silico using Network Annotation Propagation (NAP)<strong>[11]</strong>. Furthermore, peptidic natural products (PNPs) were annotated in silico, using DEREPLICATOR<strong>[12]</strong>. Chemical classes were retrieved for all GNPS library hits and in silico structures using ClassyFire<strong>[13]</strong>. Finally, all structural annotations were combined within one network using MolNetEnhancer<strong>[14]</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p>Metabolites detected in &lt; 50% of all fish samples were filtered out to reduce zero inflation issues in the dataset, and samples with &gt; 80% missing data were also excluded. Abundance data were then further processed in the R package MetaboDiff<strong>[15]</strong>, where missing data was imputed for all metabolites detected in at least 60% of samples. Abundance data were normalised across samples to generate relative abundances. The PCA generated from these normalised abundances revealed strong batch effects, a common problem in metabolomic data<strong>[16]</strong>. For the PCA and inclusion of metabolomics in the unsupervised MOFA analysis, we therefore used limma\u2019s function removeBatchEffect<strong>[17]</strong> to regress out the metabolomic batch effect from the normalised data. PERMANOVA was performed on Euclidean distances of the normalised abundances, both before and after the removal of batch effects, using the adonis2 function and testing for associations with feed type, size class and batch (Table S3).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Adusumilli R, Mallick P.
