                "description": "<p>The composition and physical properties of the extracellular matrix (ECM) critically influence tumor progression, but the molecular mechanisms underlying ECM layering are poorly understood. Tumor-stroma interaction is critically dependent on cell-cell communication mediated by exosomes, small vesicles generated within multivesicular bodies (MVBs). Here, we show that caveolin-1 (Cav1) is a central modulator of both exosome biogenesis and exosomal protein cargo sorting through the regulation of cholesterol content at the endosomal compartment/MVBs. Quantitative proteomics profiling revealed that Cav1 is required for exosomal sorting of ECM protein cargo subsets including tenascin-C (TnC), and for fibroblast-derived exosomes to efficiently depose ECM and promote tumor cell invasiveness. Cav1-driven exosomal ECM deposition not only promotes local stromal remodeling, but also the generation of distant ECM-enriched stromal niches. These results support a model by which Cav1 is a central regulatory hub for tumor-stroma interactions through a novel exosome-dependent ECM deposition mechanism.</p><p><br></p><p>Linked studies: <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS1977' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>MTBLS1977</a></p>",

To remove detached cells, conditioned medium was collected and centrifuged at 300 g for 10 min at 4 \u00baC. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 2000 g for 20 min at 4 \u00baC. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 10000 g at 4 \u00baC for 30 min to completely remove contaminating apoptotic bodies, microvesicles and cell debris. The clarified medium was then ultracentrifuged at 110,000 g at 4 \u00baC for 70 min to pellet exosomes. The supernatant was carefully removed, and crude exosome-containing pellets were washed in ice-cold PBS. After a second round of ultracentrifugation, the resulting exosome pellets were resuspended in the desired volume of PBS. For further purification, exosomes were ultracentrifuged on a discontinuous sucrose gradient including sucrose concentrations of 0.25M, 0.5M, 0.8M, 1.16M, 1.3M and 2M in 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4. Exosome samples were laid on the bottom of the gradient in the 2M sucrose fraction, followed by centrifugation at 200,000 g for 18 h. Eleven individual 1 ml gradient fractions were manually collected. Fractions were diluted in PBS and centrifuged at 110,000 g for 1 h at 4 \u00baC, and the resulting pellets were resuspended and analysed.</p>",

Glycerophospholipids and sphingomyelin were separated according to the procedure described by Axelsen et al. [1], with minor modifications. Briefly, the mobile phase consisted of a gradient of solvent A(hexanes:isopropanol, 30:40, by volume) and solvent B (hexanes:isopropanol:20 mMAcONH4 in water, 30:40:7 by volume). The gradient started at 75% A from 0 to 5 min, thendecreased from 75% A to 40% A at 15 min, from 40% A to 5% A at 20 min, holding at 5% until 40 min, and increasing to 75% at 41 min. The column was then re-equilibrated by holding at 75% A for an additional 14 min before the next sample injection. Injection volumne was 40 \u03bcL and flow rate through the column was fixed at 0.4 ml/min.</p><p><br></p><p>References:</p><p>[1] Murphy&nbsp;RC,&nbsp;Axelsen PH.
