                "description": "<p>Arterial stiffening is a hallmark of early vascular aging (EVA) syndrome and an independent predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. In this case-control study we sought to identify plasma metabolites associated with EVA syndrome in the setting of hypertension. An untargeted metabolomic approach was used to identify plasma metabolites in an age-, BMI- and sex-matched groups of EVA (n = 79) and non-EVA (n = 73) individuals with hypertension. After raw data processing and filtration, 497 putative compounds were characterized, out of which 4 were identified as lysophosphaditylcholines (LPCs) [LPC (18:2), LPC (16:0), LPC (18:0) and LPC (18:1)]. A main finding of this study shows that identified LPCs were independently associated with EVA status. Although LPCs have been shown previously to be positively associated with inflammation and atherosclerosis, we observed that hypertensive individuals characterized by 4 down-regulated LPCs had 3.8 times higher risk of EVA compared to those with higher LPC levels (OR = 3.8, 95% CI 1.7 \u2013 8.5, P &lt; .001). Our results provide new insights into a metabolomic phenotype of vascular aging and warrants further investigation of negative association of LPCs with EVA status. This study suggests that LPCs are potential candidates to be considered for further evaluation and validation as predictors of EVA in patients with hypertension </p>",

The MFE parameters including a noise threshold, possible adducts and an isotopic distribution was similar to previously described<strong>[1]</strong>. After MFE data extraction, each potential compound was described by monoisotopic mass, retention time and abundance. Afterwards, alignment procedure was applied with the use of Mass Profiler Professional B.02.01 (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany). The applied parameters for retention time and mass correction were set to 1% and 5 ppm, respectively. The alignment step provides the opportunity to address a retention time and measured mass shift during LC\u2212MS analyses, and ensures that each detected signal is denoted as the same potential compound in all plasma samples.</p><p><br></p><p>The next step of the data treatment procedure constituted filtration according to the recommended quality assurance (QA) criteria including both&nbsp;frequency (at least 50%) and coefficient of variation (CV) value (&lt; 20%) in QC samples<strong>[2]</strong>.

The identity of metabolites which clearly differentiated EVA and non-EVA patients was confirmed by LC-MS/MS consisted of an Agilent 1260 Series LC system (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany) and QTOF (model 6546, Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany). Analytical measurements were repeated with identical chromatographic parameters as in the primary untargeted analyses. The selected ions were targeted for collision-induced dissociation (CID) fragmentation based on the previously determined accurate mass and retention time. Comparison of the structure of the proposed metabolite with the fragments obtained during MS/MS analyses can confirm the identity.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Gil de la Fuente A, Godzien J, Fern\u00e1ndez L\u00f3pez M, Rup\u00e9rez FJ, Barbas C, Otero A.
