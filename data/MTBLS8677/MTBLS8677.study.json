                "description": "<p>Grafting is widely applied in the cultivation of melon. In this study, 'Qinmi No.1' [<em>Cucumis melo </em>L.<em> </em>(QG)] and 'Ribenxuesong' [<em>Cucurbita maxima</em> Duch. (RG)] were used as rootstocks for 'QingxinYangjiaocui' (<em>Cucumis melo</em> L.). The results showed that grafting with muskmelon rootstocks had no significant effect on fruit aroma, but grafting with pumpkin rootstocks significantly reduced the odor intensity and odor preference scores of melon fruits. Compared with the fruits from self-grafted plants (SG), four new aromatic volatiles with a sweet smell were detected, the alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) activity was significantly decreased at 30 DAP, but unaffected at 42 DAP in QG fruits. There was no difference for alcohol acetyltransferase (AAT) activity between QG and SG fruits. The expression level of CmADH2 was significantly higher at 30 DAP and 42 DAP, but CmAAT2 was significantly lower at 42 DAP in QG fruits compared with SG fruits. In RG fruits, the main aroma compounds including butanoic acid ethyl ester, 2-methyl-2-butenal and 2-methylheptan-1-al were absent, while the volatile compounds with unpleasant odor characteristics including trans, cis-2,6-nonadien-1-ol, (E,E)-2,4-heptadienal, octanoic acid and styrene were detected. Compared with SG fruits, 1-nonanol and 1-heptanol with green odor characteristics were significantly increased, but eucalyptol and farnesene with fruity aroma characteristics were significantly decreased in RG fruits. The ADH activity of RG fruits was significantly lower than that of SG fruits at 30 DAP and the AAT activity was significantly lower than that of SG fruits at 42 DAP. In addition, the expression levels of CmADH and CmAAT homologs in RG fruits were significantly lower than those in SG or QG fruits. These results show that grafting with pumpkin rootstocks affected the main aroma components, reduced ADH and AAT activities, and down-regulated the expression levels of CmADHs and CmAATs in the melon fruits. This study reveals the mechanism of different rootstocks on melon fruit aroma quality, and lays a theoretical foundation for the selection of rootstocks in melon production. Future studies using overexpression or CRISPR/CAS system to obtain stable transgenic lines of genes encoding key aromatic volatiles, would be promising to effectively improve the flavor quality of melon.</p>",

The oriental melon variety 'QingxianYangjiaocui' was used as a scion, while 'Qinmi No.1' (Cucumis melo&nbsp;L.) and 'Ribenxuesong' (Cucurbita maxima&nbsp;Duch.) were used as rootstocks. Fruit from self-grafted plants of 'QingxianYangjiaocui' were used as a control (SG) and compared with fruits from grafted plants of 'Qinmi No.1' (QG) and 'Ribenxuesong' (RG). Grafting was carried out on full opening of the first true leaves of the rootstocks and initial exposure of the first true leaves of the scion. The grafted seedlings were transplanted to the greenhouse 1 month post-grafting and arranged in randomized groups. Each experimental groups comprised 3 biological replicates of 20 plants, which were raised using standard management practices. Hand-pollinated bisexual flowers were marked, with 3 of the subsequently developing fruits being retained on each plant. At the end of the fruit expansion period (30 days after pollination, 30DAP) and the commercial ripening period (42 days after pollination, 42DAP), 5 plants were randomly selected from each plot, and 3 fruits of each plant were taken and crosscut. Thereafter, the central portions (2/5) of each fruit were extracted for determination of the activities and genes expression level of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and alcohol acyltransferase (AAT). For the fruits of 42 DAP, odor scores were evaluated and volatiles were determined by HS-SPME-GC-MS (headspace solid-phase microextraction coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry).</p>",

Firstly, volatile compounds from melon fruits were collected using headspace solid-phase microextraction technology. Samples (300 mg) of fresh pulp homogenate containing 10 \u03bcL of 10 mg/L 2-octanol solution (added as an internal standard) were placed in 20 mL headspace bottles. A 50/30 um DVB/CAR/PDMS fiber (Supelco, PA, USA) was exposed to the headspace of the sample for 30 min at 60 \u00b0C for SPME analysis. Subsequently, GC-MS was performed to obtain the original peak maps of each sample.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Baena-Pedroza A, Londo\u00f1o-Giraldo LM, Taborda-Ocampo G.
