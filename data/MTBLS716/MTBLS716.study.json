                "description": "<p><strong>INTRODUCTION: </strong>Myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) is the most common cardiac condition in adult dogs. The disease progresses over several years and affected dogs may develop congestive heart failure (HF). Research has shown that myocardial metabolism is altered in cardiac disease, leading to a reduction in b-oxidation of fatty acids and an increased dependence upon glycolysis.</p><p><strong>OBJECTIVES: </strong>This study aimed to evaluate whether a shift in substrate use occurs in canine patients with MMVD; a naturally occurring model of human disease.</p><p><strong>METHODS: </strong>Client-owned dogs were longitudinally evaluated at a research clinic in London, UK and paired serum samples were selected from visits when patients were in ACVIM stage B1: asymptomatic disease without cardiomegaly and stage C: HF. Samples were processed using ultra-performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry and lipid profiles were compared using mixed effects models with false discovery rate adjustment. The effect of disease stage was evaluated with patient breed entered as a confounder. Features that significantly differed were screened for selection for annotation efforts using reference databases.</p><p><strong>RESULTS: </strong>Dogs in HF had altered concentrations of lipid species belonging to several classes previously associated with cardiovascular disease. Concentrations of certain acylcarnitines, phospholipids and sphingomyelins were increased after individuals had developed HF, whilst some ceramides and lysophosphatidylcholines decreased.</p><p><strong>CONCLUSION: </strong>The canine metabolome appears to change as MMVD progresses. Findings from this study suggest that in HF myocardial metabolism may be characterised by reduced beta-oxidation. This proposed explanation warrants further research.</p>",

Patients underwent biannual examinations by a board-certified veterinary cardiologist (AB) who obtained standard right parasternal echocardiographic views at each visit. Stage B1 defined preclinical dogs where the left atrial to aortic root ratio (LA:Ao)<strong>[1]</strong> and the normalised left ventricular internal diameter at end diastole (LVIDDN)<strong>[2]</strong> fell below 1.50 and 1.85, respectively<strong>[3]</strong>. A diagnosis of stage C disease was primarily reliant upon radiographic signs of congestive HF<strong>[4]</strong>. In the absence of radiographs, historical and physical examination findings consistent with congestive HF were interpreted alongside echocardiography. At each visit, a jugular blood sample was collected and placed into a serum gel tube (Sarstedt, N\u00fcmbrecht, Germany). Samples were stored at 4 \u00b0C for up to 5 h before undergoing centrifugation at 1000 x g for 15 min. Serum was then removed and stored at -80 \u00b0C until the time of analysis.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Hansson K, H\u00e4ggstr\u00f6m J, Kvart C, Lord P.

The MS component was a Xevo G2-S oaTOF MS (Waters Corp., Manchester, UK) coupled to the UPLC via a Zspray electrospray ionization (ESI) source. Instrument ion source and ion guide settings were as follows for all assays, unless specified otherwise: capillary, 2 kV (ESI+) / 1.5 kV (ESI-); source temperature, 120 \u00b0C; desolvation temperature, 600 \u00b0C; desolvation gas flow, 1000 L/h; cone gas flow, 150 L/h; cone, 25 V; source offset, 80 V; StepWave 2 offset, 15 V. Data were collected in centroid mode with a scan range of 50-2000 m/z and a scan time of 0.1s. The angular positioning of the sample probe in relation to the inlet cone was set to 7 mm on the adjustment micrometer. For mass accuracy, instrument calibration was performed using sodium formate before each ESI mode acquisition. LockSpray mass correction was performed using a 600 pg/\u03bcL leucine enkephalin solution (m/z 556.2771 in ESI+ and m/z 554.2615 in ESI-) in 50:50 H2O:ACN solution at a flow rate of 15 \u03bcL/min. Lockmass scans were collected every 60 s and averaged over 3 scans.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>All reagents were of LC-MS grade from Sigma-Aldrich (Steinheim, Germany) (ACN, formic acid, ammonium formate), Fisher Scientific (Hampton, NH, USA) (water) and Waters Corp (leucine enkephalin).</p>",

The Lipid RPC chromatographic method used for CID-MS/MS analysis was the same as that used in the profiling method with the same MS source conditions. CID-MS/MS target selection was performed using unit mass selection via quadrupole with a collision energy voltage ramp of 10-45 V and/or 20-60 V.
