                "description": "<p>Root mutualistic microbes can modulate the production of plant secondary metabolites affecting plant\u2013herbivore interactions. Still, the main mechanisms underlying the impact of root mutualists on herbivore performance remain ambiguous. In particular, little is known about how changes in the plant metabolome induced by root mutualists affect the insect metabolome and postlarval development. By using bioassays with tomato plants (Solanum lycopersicum), we analyzed the impact of the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus Rhizophagus irregularis and the growth-promoting fungus Trichoderma harzianum on the plant interaction with the specialist insect herbivore Manduca sexta. We found that root colonization by the mutualistic microbes impaired insect development, including metamorphosis. By using untargeted metabolomics, we found that root colonization by the mutualistic microbes altered the secondary metabolism of tomato shoots, leading to enhanced levels of steroidal glycoalkaloids. Untargeted metabolomics further revealed that root colonization by the mutualists affected the metabolome of the herbivore, leading to an enhanced accumulation of steroidal glycoalkaloids and altered patterns of fatty acid amides and carnitine-derived metabolites. Our results indicate that the changes in the shoot metabolome triggered by root mutualistic microbes can cascade up altering the metabolome of the insects feeding on the colonized plants, thus affecting the insect development.</p>",

After sterilization, the seeds were placed on fine-grained moist vermiculite and germinated in the dark for 3 d at 28 \u00b0C, followed by 7 d in a plant growth chamber at 25 \u00b1 3 \u00b0C, 16 h/8 h day:night cycle, 65\u201370% RH conditions. 10 d after germination, the seedlings were transplanted into 400 ml pots containing a sterile sand/vermiculite mixture (1:1, v/v). Inoculation with <em>R. irregularis</em> was performed by mixing the <em>R. irregularis</em> inoculum with the sand/vermiculite mixture at 10% (v/v) before transplanting<strong>[3]</strong>. Inoculation with <em>T. harzianum</em> was achieved by mixing the <em>T. harzianum</em> inoculum with the substrate to achieve a final density of 1 x 10^6 conidia/g before transplanting<strong>[3]</strong>. The plants were then placed in a completely randomized design in controlled climate chambers at 16 h/8 h day/night cycle, 65\u201370% RH. The plants were watered with tap water every second day, and once per wk with Hoagland nutrient solution 50% water diluted<strong>[4]</strong>. 4 wk after transplanting, plants were used for the experiments. We did not find differences in the shoot biomass of the different treatments, and all the plants appeared similar, with no evident differences between the treatments.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Leaf Metabolomics:</strong></p><p><strong>Bioassay for the Assessment of the Impact of <em>Rhizophagus irregularis</em> and <em>Trichoderma harzianum</em> on Tomato Leaf Metabolome:</strong></p><p>1 first-instar <em>M. sexta</em> larva was placed on the apical leaflet of the third fully expanded leaf (counted from above) using a clip cage, which was moved to a new leaf every 2 d. The plants had been inoculated with <em>R. irregularis</em> or <em>T. harzianum</em>, or were non-inoculated, as described above. Dead <em>M. sexta</em> larvae were immediately replaced by larvae of the same age that had been feeding on plants from the same treatment. Empty clip cages were placed on leaves of non-infested plants. A total of 6 biological replicates (plants) were used per treatment and time point. Larvae were replaced weekly by new first-instar larvae to avoid consumption of the entire plant. 3 wk after first challenging the plants, the leaf the larvae were actually feeding on was collected, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C for metabolomics analyses.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Insect Metabolomics:</strong></p><p><strong>Bioassay to Assess the Impact of <em>Rhizophagus irregularis</em> and <em>Trichoderma harzianum</em> on the Metabolome of <em>Manduca sexta</em> Gut and Fat Body:</strong></p><p>We used 45 tomato plants per microbial treatment (inoculated with <em>R. irregularis</em> or <em>T. harzianum</em> or non-inoculated). On each plant, we placed 4 second-instar larvae on the third fully expanded leaf (counted from above) using a clip cage, which was moved to a new leaf every 2 d. Within the first week, dead larvae were removed and replaced by new ones of the same age. After the first week of herbivory, since the caterpillars had grown too large for the clip cage, we replaced the cage by a net bag wrapped around the plant. During the bioassay, plants of the same treatment were exchanged for the damaged plants as needed to allow the larvae to feed ad libitum throughout the experiment. 3 wk after the start of the experiment, the larvae were collected and kept on ice while transferred to be stored at \u221220 \u00b0C for dissection.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Dissection of <em>Manduca sexta</em> Larvae and Separation of the Gut and Fat Body Samples:</strong></p><p>Before the dissection, the larvae were kept cool on ice for 30 min to sedate them. By using a sterile scalpel, each larva was dissected on 2 points. At first, the red horn at the bottom of the larval body was removed. Then, each larva was cut open at the ventral side from the head down to the posterior end using surgical scissors. For the separation of the samples, the central gut and the fat body tissues were carefully removed from the larval body using tweezers and subsequently separated one from each other. Guts and fat body samples from individual larvae were stored separately in a 1.5 ml safety lock Eppendorf tube, and the cap of each tube was punctured by using a sterile syringe before use. The samples were stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until further processing. Afterwards, the samples were freeze-dried and stored again at \u221280 \u00b0C until metabolite extraction.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Mart\u00ednez-Medina A, Rold\u00e1n A, Pascual JA.

For the sample extraction solution, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC grade, VWR International GmbH, Dresden, Germany) methanol and acetate buffer were used. For the preparation of the acetate buffer, 2.3 ml acetic acid (100% p.a., ROTH) and 3.41 g ammonium acetate (\u226597% p.a., ACS, ROTH) were dissolved in 1L Millipore water. The pH of the buffer solution was adjusted to 4.8. For the extraction buffer, the acetate buffer (25%) was mixed with methanol (MeOH) (75%). For the extraction procedure, 100 \u00b1 5 mg of each ground sample was weighed in a 2 ml Eppendorf tube. 1 ml of the extraction solution was added to each sample; the tube was tightly sealed and shaken for 10 s. Subsequently, each sample was sonicated for 5 min at 30 Hz using an FB 15061 sonicator (Elma, Singen, Germany) and then centrifuged for 15 min at 15,000 x g. The supernatant was pipetted with a 1 ml pipette into a new-labeled Eppendorf tube, and the first Eppendorf tube was kept. By using the pipette, we added 1 ml of the extraction solution again to the pellet of the first extraction tube. The sealed tube was shaken again for 10 s and subsequently shaken for 5 min at 30 Hz in a sonicator. Then, it was centrifuged again for 15 min at 15,000 x g. The 2 supernatants were combined, and the sample containing both supernatants was centrifuged for 10 min at 15,000 x g; afterwards, 200 \u03bcl of the sample was transferred in an HPLC vial, and 800 \u03bcl of the extraction solution was added, resulting in a 1:5 dilution of the samples. The samples were then transferred to liquid chromatography-quadrupole time of flight-mass spectrometry for analysis.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Insect Metabolomics:</strong></p><p>The gut and fat body sample dry masses were assessed before extraction. To handle the variability in the samples weight, we extracted the metabolites by following the ratio w/v = 1:2, meaning that in each sample tube, the volume of the extracting solution added in ml would be double that of the sample\u2019s mass in mg. Using this procedure, the appropriate volume of 70% MeOH (\u226599.9%, HiPerSolv CHROMANORM til HPLC, VWR, S\u00f8borg, Denmark), with 10 ppm palmitic acid methyl ester (Merck, S\u00f8borg, Denmark) and 10 ppm sorbitol (99%, Merck, S\u00f8borg) as internal standards, was added to each sample. The samples were vigorously vortexed for 30 s at 3000 rpm and then centrifuged at 12,000 x g for 20 min at 4 \u00b0C. For LC-MS analyses, 50 \u03bcl of the supernatant (extracts) was transferred to a 200 \u03bcl glass insert in a 2 ml labelled glass vial. The vials (32 x 11.6 mm, Mikrolab Aarhus A/S, Denmark) containing the extracts were sealed with cap with septum and placed in the fridge (\u221220 \u00b0C) until analysis by LC-MS.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Rogachev I., Aharoni A.

For the identification of the steroidal glycoalkaloid \u03b1-tomatine in the leaf extracts, we used the commercial standard \u03b1-tomatine (500 mg, 0602, Lot: 12021719, Extrasynthase, Genay, France).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Insect Metabolomics:</strong></p><p>The qToF mass spectrometer was operated in full scan positive ion mode with the following instrument settings: m/z 50-1200: nebulizer gas (nitrogen), 2.0 bar; drying gas (nitrogen), 8 L/min; drying gas temperature, 220 \u00b0C; capillary voltage, 4000 V; full scan MS spectra acquisition rate, 2 Hz; set ion energy, 4.0 eV; set isolation mass, m/z 100.00; collision energy, 7.0 eV; and set collision cell RF, 500.0 Vpp. For the <strong>MS/MS</strong> spectra, the qToF mass spectrometer was operated as described previously with the following conditions for the collision cell (quadrupole): set ion energy, 4.0 eV; set isolation mass, m/z 100.00; collision energy, 7.0 eV; set collision cell RF, 500.0 Vpp. Every chromatogram was calibrated to provide accurate mass by automated infusion of sodium formate clusters (10 mM) at the beginning of each run. For the identification of the steroidal glycoalkaloid \u03b1-tomatine in the insect extracts, the commercial standard \u03b1-tomatine (CAS Number: 17406-45-0, Merck, Germany) was used. All data acquisition was automated using a combination of Chromeleon Express (Thermo Fisher Scientific), Compass qTOF Control (Version 4.0.15.3248, Bruker Daltonics), and Hystar (Version 3.2 SR4, Bruker Daltonics) software.</p>",
