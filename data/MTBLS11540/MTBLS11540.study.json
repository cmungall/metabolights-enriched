                "description": "<p>Metabolic state-reprogramming approach was extended from Gram-neg\u0002ative bacteria to Gram-positive bacterium methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) for identifying desired reprogramming metabolites to synergize existing antibiotic killing to MRSA. Metabolomics comparison between MRSA and methicillin\u0002sensitive Staphylococcus aureus showed a depressed metabolic state in MRSA. Valine was identified as the most depressed metabolite/biomarker, and valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis as the most enriched metabolic pathway. Thus, valine was used as a reprogramming metabolite to potentiate existing antibiotic killing to MRSA. Among the tested antibiotics, valine synergized cefoperazone-sulbactam (SCF) to produce the greatest killing effect. The combined effect of SCF and valine was demonstrated in clinical MRSA isolates and in mouse systemic and thigh infection models. Underlying mechanisms were attributed to valine-induced the activation of the pyruvate cycle/the TCA cycle and fatty acid biosynthesis. The activated pyruvate cycle/the TCA cycle elevated proton motive force by NADH and the activated fatty acid biosynthesis promoted membrane permeability by lauric acid. Both together increased cefoperazone uptake, which outpaces efflux action and thereby intracellular drug is elevated to effectively kill MRSA. These results provide the combination of valine and SCF to produce a new drug candidate effective against MRSA.</p>",
