                "description": "Dysregulated maternal fatty acid metabolism increases the risk of congenital heart disease (CHD) in offspring with an unknown mechanism, and the effect of folic acid fortification in preventing CHD is controversial. Using gas chromatography coupled to either a flame ionization detector or mass spectrometer (GC-FID/MS) analysis, we find that the palmitic acid (PA) concentration increases significantly in serum samples of pregnant women bearing children with CHD. Feeding pregnant mice with PA increased CHD risk in offspring and cannot be rescued by folic acid supplementation. We further find that PA promotes methionyl-tRNA synthetase (MARS) expression and protein lysine homocysteinylation (K-Hcy) of GATA4 and results in GATA4 inhibition and abnormal heart development. Targeting K-Hcy modification by either genetic ablation of Mars or using N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) decreases CHD onset in high-PA-diet-fed mice. In summary, our work links maternal malnutrition and MARS/K-Hcy with the onset of CHD and provides a potential strategy in preventing CHD by targeting K-Hcy other than folic acid supplementation.",

The study design and conduct were approved and supervised by the Ethics Committee of the Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital of Fudan University through Ethics Vote 2015-17-C1 in accordance with the criteria established by the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients and controls before the start of the study. Serum samples were obtained from women in their first trimester at weeks 9-11 of gestation. The case group included 16 pregnant women bearing children with VSDs and 16 pregnant women bearing children with ASDs. The control group consisted of 32 pregnant women bearing healthy children. CHD phenotypes were first identified by cardiac screening examinations during week 22 of gestation and confirmed after birth using neonatal echocardiography. Participants presenting clinical features of developmental syndromes, multiple major developmental anomalies, known chromosomal abnormalities or a family history of CHD in a first-degree relative (parent, sibling or child) were excluded. All participants were unrelated to the ethnic Han Chinese. The demographic characteristics of the pregnant women bearing children with or without CHD are shown in Table&nbsp;S2 in the paper associated with this study.</p>",

In brief, 50&nbsp;\u03bcL of serum samples were added to 600&nbsp;\u03bcL of precooled methanol and incubated at -80 \u00b0C overnight. Supernatants were collected after 10&nbsp;min of centrifugation (12,000 x g, 4 \u00b0C). Next, 20&nbsp;\u03bcL of internal standards in hexane (1&nbsp;mg/mL methyl heptadecanoate, 0.5&nbsp;mg/mL methyl tricosanoate and 28&nbsp;mg/mL butylated hydroxytoluene) were added to a Pyrex tube, followed by the addition of 100&nbsp;\u03bcL of the above supernatant and 1&nbsp;mL of methanol:hexane mixture (4:1, v/v). The tubes were cooled in liquid nitrogen for 15&nbsp;min. Next, 100&nbsp;\u03bcL of precooled acetyl chloride was added, and the mixture was flushed briefly with nitrogen gas. The tubes were screw-capped and maintained at 25 \u00b0C in the dark for 24 h. The tubes were then cooled in an ice bath for 10&nbsp;min, followed by gradual addition of 2.5&nbsp;mL of 6% K2CO3 solution (with shaking) for neutralization. After the tubes were left to stand for 30&nbsp;min, 200&nbsp;\u03bcL of hexane was added to extract the methylated fatty acids. The mixture was left to stand for 10&nbsp;min, and then the upper layer was transferred to a glass sample vial. This extraction process was repeated twice, and the supernatants were combined and evaporated to dryness. The residues were dissolved in 100&nbsp;\u03bcL of hexane and subjected to GC-FID/MS analysis.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> An Y, Xu W, Li H, Lei H, Zhang L, Hao F, Duan Y, Yan X, Zhao Y, Wu J, Wang Y, Tang H.
