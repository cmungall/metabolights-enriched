                "description": "Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), one of the most common nanomaterials in use today, have been shown to enter the aquatic environment from use of commercially obtained products. Although acute toxicity has been shown in vitro and in vivo, there is still a great deal of uncertainty surrounding the molecular mechanism of AgNP-induced toxicity. Much of the current literature centres on the question of whether toxicity is induced by the AgNPs themselves or by ionic silver released from the nanoparticle surface. Here, I present research investigating AgNP toxicity to Daphnia magna, a keystone species of freshwater ecosystems the world over, using a multi-omics platform of transcriptomics and metabolomics techniques. Initially, the AgNPs were fully characterised and the exposure conditions optimised to accurately assess the impact of AgNP exposure to D. magna. This allowed for the design of sub-lethal AgNP exposures that had been fully controlled for the fraction of dissolved silver ions. Secondly, using this multi-omics platform, the role of Ag+ ions in AgNP toxicity to D. magna was determined. Finally a metabolic pathway perturbed by AgNP exposure was identified, as well as two constituent metabolites of key importance. Overall, this research advances the mechanistic understanding of AgNP toxicity to aquatic organisms, and further highlights the need for greater consideration of the nanoscale in regulative legislature.",

These exposure concentrations of AgNO3 equate to 0.28, 0.14, 0.07 and 0.04 \u03bcg/l of total Ag+ ions (Ag+ High, Mid, Low and V.

PVP) and bulk silver (4.7 \u03bcg/l, 3\u03bcm average diameter, Sigma Aldrich) controls were used to account for background mortality, any potential impact of the capping agent, and to control for potential aggregation effects respectively. The dissolved Ag filtered from the AgNP stock prior to use was included as an additional filtrate control. Each biological replicate consisted of 30 D. magna neonates (<24 h) with 6 biological replicates per treatment group with the exception of AgNP High which had 8 replicates to account for potential mortalities induced by the higher concentration. Groups of 30 D. magna neonates (<24 h) were added to individual exposure vessels (250 ml glass beaker, Fisher Scientific) containing 200 ml of medium (adjusted to pH 7.0). The appropriate exposure stock (1 ml) was then used to spike the study medium followed immediately by 49 ml of additional medium to mix. Exposure vessels were kept at 19 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C and on a 16 h:8 h light:dark cycle with no additional food or supplements administered. Tests were only considered valid if no more than 10% of control animals were immobilised during the exposure.  Following exposure, animals were filtered from their medium into a precellys tube, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 \u00b0C prior to extraction.",

A 112 \u03bcl aliquot of homogenate was then removed into a nuclease-free microfuge tube (1.7 ml, Axygen) for RNA extraction and replaced with the same volume of 5:2 methanol:water. Polar metabolites were extracted from the remaining homogenate using a two-step, biphasic method as detailed previously [1]. Following extraction, the upper, polar layer of each sample was removed into a single 1.5 ml microfuge tube (Starstedt, Leicester, UK) via Hamilton syringe. Polar extracts were dried under vacuum (Savant Refrigerated Vapour Trap, Thermo Scientific) using a centrifugal concentrator (Savant SpeedVac concentrator, Thermo Scientific) without application of heat and stored at -80 \u00b0C prior to FT-ICR analysis. Two extract blanks were created using the above homogenisation and extraction protocols in the absence of biological material.</br>\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Wu H, Southam AD, Hines A, Viant MR.

All re-suspended samples were centrifuged at 22,000 rcf, 4 \u00b0C for 10 minutes to remove particulate matter.  The supernatant of each sample was then loaded alongside quality control (QC) samples in a randomly generated order on 384 well plates (Agilent technologies).  QC samples were created from a pool of D. magna polar extract from a separately collected group of neonates.  Once an entire plate was loaded, it was permanently sealed using a single, heat-sealed, foil sheet (ALPS 50V, Thermo Fisher Scientific, US).  All extracts were analysed in quadruplicate using an LTQ-FT Ultra (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) hybrid LTQ FT-ICR mass spectrometer with a direct infusion, chip-based nano-electrospray ionisation source (Triversa, Advion Biosciences, Ithaca, NY). Nanoelectrospray conditions consisted of a 200 nl/min flow rate, 0.3 psi backing pressure and an electrospray voltage of either +1.7 kV or -1.7 kV in positive or negative ion mode respectively controlled by Chipsoft software (Advion, Ithaca, NY, USA).  An automatic gain control setting of 1x106 was used in combination with a mass resolution of 100,000 (FWHM at 400 m/z).  Each technical replicate was analysed using Xcalibur software (Version, Thermo Scientific). Data were acquired as transients from m/z 70-590 using the selected ion monitoring (SIM) stitching methodology [1][2][3] in 7 SIM windows of 100 m/z width and 30 m/z overlap. Samples were analysed in a randomly generated order with QC samples spaced evenly throughout to disentangle MS technical drift from biological differences.</br>\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Southam AD, Payne TG, Cooper HJ, Arvanitis TN, Viant MR.

                        "description": "Transient data from the FT-ICR were processed, and the SIM stitch algorithm was applied as described previously [1][2]. Briefly, transients were averaged and then transformed into spectra with Fast Fourier Transform [3] and calibrated using a list of defined peaks for each SIM window (Section 9.3). SIM window spectra were then \u2018stitched\u2019 together through the alignment of peaks in overlapping regions (30 Da) using the SIM-stitching algorithm [1]. All peaks with intensities with a signal to noise ratio of less than 3.5 were removed, as were areas of \u2018mechanical noise\u2019 or \u2018high noise regions\u2019 in the m/z ranges of (m/z = (74.05-74.2); (90.50-90.58), (101.32-101.42); (101.6-102.1); (105.1-105.5); and (116.37 116.5)). This process resulted in four stitched spectra per biological sample; the three best quality replicates were then selected for further filtering. Replicate quality was primarily based on the variation of relative intensity within SIM windows. The spectra of the three selected technical replicates were then aligned and merged, with peaks being retained only if present in at least two of the remaining three replicates, thus resulting in one spectrum per biological sample. When aligning replicate spectra, peaks were considered to be the same if they occurred within a 1.5 ppm error of one another along the m/z axis. The spectra of all samples were then aligned and filtered with m/z peaks only being retained if they were present in at least 80% of all experimental samples. Due to the differing origin of the QC samples, they were excluded from this process to avoid skewing the filter. When aligning sample spectra, peaks were considered to be the same if they occurred within a 2.5 ppm error of one another along the m/z axis. Any of the remaining sample peaks which were also detected within the extract blanks were removed from all spectra. All spectral processing steps were completed in MATLAB (student version 7, The Math-Works, Natick, MA). These processing steps yield a matrix of raw peak intensity values, with columns corresponding to m/z values and rows corresponding to samples, which require further processing before statistical analysis.</br>\nGlog transformation</br>\nPeaks of naturally higher intensities are intrinsically prone to greater technical variation, in terms of absolute values, than those which are naturally lower in intensity.  This can skew the results of multivariate statistical analysis. To counteract this, the normalised matrix was transformed using the generalised logarithm transformation [4]. This process uses a scaling factor (\u03bb) derived from the QC samples i.e. samples between which, theoretically, the only variation is technical and not biological.  This process stabilises technical variation and reduces dominance of large intensity peaks, allows for better observation of biological differences in subsequent multivariate statistical analyses such as PCA ([4].\nPQN normalisation</br>\nTo account for variation arising from differences in sample concentration, the resulting filtered matrix was normalised via Probable Quotient Normalisation (PQN) [5] using an in-house MATLAB script. We calculate qQuotients of dilution were calculated, by dividing the intensity of each peak in a spectrum by the mean intensity for that peak across all samples.  The median quotient of the entire spectrum is then selected as the scaling factor (most probable quotient) for that spectrum.  Quotients were only calculated for peaks that occurred in 100 % of all samples except QCs.</br>\nTo prevent miscalculation of fold changes, missing values were imputed using the k-nearest neighbour (KNN) algorithm using an in-house MATLAB script [6]. Briefly, the top k (in this study k=5) peaks with the most similar intensity profiles across all samples were used to calculate a weighted average (the most similar peaks  being favoured) for that sample.  This value was then imputed in the place of the missing value. This normalised matrix with imputed missing values was used for the assessment of fold changes in peak intensities across groups and for univariate analysis to determine significantly changing peaks.</br>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Southam AD, Payne TG, Cooper HJ, Arvanitis TN, Viant MR.
