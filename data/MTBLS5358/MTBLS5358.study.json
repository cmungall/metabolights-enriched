                "description": "<h4><strong>OBJECTIVE:</strong> Emerging evidence suggests that glucose depletion (GD)-induced cell death depends on system Xc-, a glutamate/cystine antiporter extensively studied in ferroptosis. However, the underlying mechanism remains debated. Our study confirmed the correlation between system Xc- and GD-induced cell death and provided a strategic treatment for oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC).</h4><p><strong>METHODS:</strong> qPCR and Western blotting were performed to detect changes in xCT and CD98 expression after glucose withdrawal. Then, the cell viability of OSCCs under the indicated conditions was measured. To identify the GD-responsible transcriptional factors of SLC7A11, we performed a luciferase reporter assay and a ChIP assay. Further, metabolomics was conducted to identify changes in metabolites. Finally, mitochondrial function and ATP production were evaluated using the seahorse assay, and NADP+/NADPH dynamics were measured using a NADP+/NADPH kit.</p><p><strong>RESULTS:</strong> In OSCCs, system Xc- promoted GD-induced cell death by increasing glutamate consumption, which promoted NADPH exhaustion and TCA blockade. Moreover, GD-induced xCT upregulation was governed by the p-eIF2\u03b1/ATF4 axis.</p><h4><strong>CONCLUSIONS:</strong> System Xc- overexpression compromised the metabolic flexibility of OSCC under GD conditions, and thus, glucose starvation therapy is effective for killing OSCC cells.</h4>",

A data matrix was derived. The 3D matrix includes: sample information, the name of the peak of each substance, retention time, retention index, mass-to-charge ratio and signal intensity. In each sample, all peak signal intensities were segmented and normalized according to the internal standards with RSD greater than 0.3 after screening. After the data was normalized, redundancy removal and peak merging were conducted to obtain the data matrix.</p><p><br></p><p>The matrix was imported in <strong>R</strong> to carry out Principle Component Analysis (PCA) to observe the overall distribution among the samples and the stability of the whole analysis process. Orthogonal Partial Least-Squares-Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA) and Partial Least-Squares-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) were utilized to distinguish the metabolites that differ between groups. To prevent overfitting, 7-fold cross-validation and 200 Response Permutation Testing (RPT) were used to evaluate the quality of the model. Variable Importance of Projection (VIP) values obtained from the OPLS-DA model were used to rank the overall contribution of each variable to group discrimination. A two-tailed Student\u2019s T-test was further used to verify whether the metabolites of difference between groups were significant. Differential metabolites were selected with VIP values greater than 1.0 and p-values less than 0.05.</p>",
