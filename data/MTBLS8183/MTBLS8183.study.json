                "description": "<p>Depression is an individual risk factor for poor prognosis in patients with heart failure (HF). Recent studies show that gut microbiota and metabolites have critical role in comorbid HF and depressive symptoms. We recruited 95 subjects including 35 HF patients with depressive symptoms (HF-DS), 36 HF patients without depressive symptoms (HF-NDS) and 24 healthy controls (HC). The 16S rRNA, metagenome sequencing and untargeted metabolomic analysis were employed to test fecal samples. Our analysis found there was a significant difference composition of gut microbiota in HF-DS, HF-NDS and HC populations. At the genus level, Mediterranea, Tolumona and Parabacteroides were significantly increased in HF-DS patients compared with HF-NDS patients, while Pedobacter, Azospirillum and Ruminiclostridium were significantly decreased. Furthermore, anti-inflammatory mediators (abietic acid, quinic acid, linoleic acid, etc) and neurotransmitters (catechin, serotonin, tryptamine, phenylethylamine, etc) were reduced in HF-DS. The enrichment analysis revealed that the gut microbiota highly conformed with the functional pathways of metabolites, and amino acid-related metabolism, fatty acid-related metabolism and cAMP signaling pathways may be crucial biological mechanisms involved in the development of comorbid depression and HF. Finally, Cloacibacillus and alpha-tocopherol were determined as diagnostic markers for HF-DS patients.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>IMPORTANCE:</strong> There is increasing evidence that alterations in gut microbial composition and function are associated with cardiovascular or psychiatric disease. Therefore, it is meaningful to investigate the taxonomic and functional characterization of the microbiota in HF patients who also have depressive symptoms. In this cross-sectional study, Cloacibacillus and alpha-tocopherol were determined as new diagnostic markers. Furthermore, intestinal microecosystem disorders are closely linked to depressive symptoms in HF patients, providing a new reference viewpoint for understanding the gut-heart/brain axis.</p>",

HF patients met the 2016 ESC guideline criteria for the diagnosis of heart failure<strong>[1]</strong>, an integration of at least one of the following: elevated natriuretic peptide levels; objective evidence of cardiogenic pulmonary or body circulation stasis, including imaging (e.g., chest radiograph and echocardiogram); and resting or stress hemodynamic monitoring (e.g., right heart catheter and pulmonary artery catheter). Furthermore, the following participants were excluded from the study: (i) taking probiotics or antibiotics within 2 weeks before the trial; (ii) comorbid with autoimmune diseases, infections, malignancies and acute coronary syndromes; (iii) comorbid with cerebrovascular embolism, respiratory diseases and other diseases influencing the intestinal microbiota; and (iv) unable to complete depression scale evaluations or to retain feces. HF patients were scored by the PHQ-9 self-rating scale, a nine-item questionnaire that is often used to screen patients for depressive symptoms. Ultimately, 71 heart failure (HF) patients were recruited in this research, with scores \u226510 in the HF patients with depressive symptoms (HF-DS) group (n = 35) and &lt;10 in the HF patients without depressive symptoms (HF-NDS) group (n = 36), and 24 healthy controls (HC) who had a physical examination. All patients were treated based on the current HF management guidelines, and important clinical information was obtained from electronic medical records. This study was authorized by the Ethics Committee of the Third Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University (No. 2021140) and complied with the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki, and all participants (or their immediate family members) gave informed consent.

Then, data were imported into software MS-DIAL, which performs peak detection, peak identification, MS2Dec deconvolution, characterization, peak alignment, wave filtering and missing value interpolation. Metabolite characterization is based on LUG database. A data matrix was derived. The 3D matrix includes: sample information, the name of the peak of each substance, retention time, retention index, mass-to-charge ratio and signal intensity. In each sample, all peak signal intensities were segmented and normalized according to the internal standards with RSD greater than 0.3 after screening. After the data was normalized, redundancy removal and peak merging were conducted to obtain the data matrix. The matrix was imported in R to carry out Principle Component Analysis (PCA) to observe the overall distribution among the samples and the stability of the whole analysis process. Orthogonal Partial Least-Squares-Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA) and Partial Least-Squares-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) were utilized to distinguish the metabolites that differ between groups. To prevent overfitting, 7-fold cross-validation and 200 Response Permutation Testing (RPT) were used to evaluate the quality of the model. Variable Importance of Projection (VIP) values obtained from the OPLS-DA model were used to rank the overall contribution of each variable to group discrimination. A two-tailed Student\u2019s T-test was further used to verify whether the metabolites of difference between groups were significant. Differential metabolites were selected with VIP values greater than 1.0 and p-values less than 0.05.</p>",
