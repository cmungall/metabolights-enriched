                "description": "<p>The metabolic network, composed of thousands of metabolic reactions, is essential for any organism. Despite its importance, a systems level understanding of how metabolic network is wired by reactions that carry flux in unperturbed condition and rewired by transcriptionally activating or repressing metabolic genes in response to metabolic perturbations are still lacking in any animal. Here, we apply Worm Perturb-Seq (WPS), a high-throughput, whole-animal RNAi and RNA-seq method, to ~900 metabolic genes in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We derive a metabolic gene regulatory network (mGRN) in which 385 perturbations are connected to 9,414 genes by more than 110,000 interactions. The mGRN has a highly modular structure in which 22 perturbation clusters connect to 44 gene expression programs, involving metabolism, stress response and other functions. The mGRN reveals different modes of transcriptional rewiring from simple reaction and pathway compensation to rerouting and more complex network coordination. Using metabolic network modeling, we discover a design principle of transcriptional rewiring we name the \u2018compensation/repression\u2019 (CR) model. The CR model explains the majority of the transcriptional responses in metabolic genes and reveals a high-level of compensation and repression in five core metabolic functions related to energy and biomass.</p><p><br></p><p>Leveraging the comprehensive data from WPS, we find that the transcriptional response to metabolic gene perturbations can be integrated with the genome-scale metabolic network models to infer a highly constrained, semi-quantitative flux distribution of unperturbed animal. We discover several features of adult C. elegans metabolism, including cyclic flux through the pentose phosphate pathway, lack of de novo purine synthesis flux, and the primary use of amino acids and bacterial RNA as a tricarboxylic acid cycle carbon source, all of which we validate by stable isotope tracing. Our strategy for inferring metabolic wiring based on transcriptional phenotypes should be applicable to a variety of systems, including human cells.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>LC-MS analyses</strong> is reported in the current study&nbsp;<a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS11741' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS11741</strong></a>.</p><p><strong>GC-MS analyses</strong>&nbsp;is reported in&nbsp;<a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS11742' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS11742</strong></a>.</p>",

Following this, 800 \u00b5L of the animal pellet was transferred to a well of an ice-cold 96-well filter plate (Enzymax: EZ96FTP).

The mixture was vortexed for 3 cycles of 1 min each, with 2 min intervals to cool down the samples on ice, followed by centrifugation at top speed (~ 15,000 x g) for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C. The top layer, containing non-polar metabolites, was discarded, and the bottom layer was transferred to a new tube. The polar phase extractions were then dried using a SpeedVac overnight at 4 \u00b0C or for 4 h at room temperature. Dried metabolites were subsequently resuspended in LC-MS grade water (Fisher: 60-090-634). The resuspension volume normalized the metabolite content per \u00b5L to a worth of 1 \u00b5g protein (as determined by BCA assay stated above).</p>",
