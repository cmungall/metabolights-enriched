                "description": "Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is a candidate crop for production of plant-based vaccines by genetic engineering technologies. MucoRice-CTB has been developed as a rice-seed-based vaccine against cholera by transgenic expression of modified cholera toxin B-subunit (CTB) under the RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated suppression of endogenous seed storage proteins. Here, we performed non-targeted metabolomic profiling of MucoRice-CTB to understand the overall effects of the genetic engineering on rice seed metabolism using gas chromatography/time-of-flight mass spectrometry.",

                        "description": "In this study, we used two transgenic rice lines (abbreviated as MR-CTB51A and MR-RNAi) and their parental non-transgenic rice cultivar (O. sativa L. cv. Nipponbare; abbreviated as NPB). MR-CTB51A is a transgenic rice line expressing modified CTB and RNA interference (RNAi)-triggers for endogenous seed storage protein genes (MucoRice-CTB transgenic rice line 51A [1]). MR-RNAi is a transgenic rice line expressing RNAi-triggers for endogenous seed storage protein genes (MucoRice-RNAi [2]).\n</p>\nIn both MR-CTB51A and MR-RNAi, the RNAi-triggers for endogenous seed storage protein genes were designed to suppress both prolamin and glutelin gene expression [1,2]. However, the RNAi-trigger sequences and its promoter differed between the two transgenic rice lines [1,2]. In MR-CTB51A, the trigger sequences were 13 kDa prolamin clone RM1 (Os07g0206500) coding sequence (CDS) positions 1\u201345 and GluB1 (Os02g0249800) CDS positions 139\u2013366 (controlled by 10 kDa prolamin promoter) [1]. In MR-RNAi, the trigger sequences were 13 kDa prolamin clone RM1 (Os07g0206500) CDS positions 1\u201345 and GluA2 (Os10g0400200) CDS positions 142\u2013270 (controlled by ubiquitin promoter) [2]. MR-CTB51A is a selection marker-free transgenic rice line generated by an agrobacterium-mediated co-transformation method [1]. In contrast, MR-RNAi is a transgenic rice line harbouring a selection marker gene, hygromycin phosphotransferase (HPT), under the control of cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter [2].\n</p>\nMR-CTB51A and NPB plants were hydroponically grown in a growth chamber (for details see Kashima et al. [3]). Brown rice samples from NPB plants grown hydroponically were named NPB-HP. NPB plants were also grown in an open-air paddy field (Niigata, Japan) using a conventional method. A brown rice sample from the NPB plants grown in the paddy field was named NPB-PF. MR-RNAi plants were grown in a soil pot in a growth chamber (for details see Kurokawa et al. [2]).\n</p>\nRice ears were harvested from MR-CTB51A, MR-RNAi, and NPB plants at least 40 days after heading. After harvesting, the ears were dried in a ventilated incubator for several days until the water content dropped to approximately 10%. From the dried rice ears, rice grains were collected. The husks of the grains were removed to obtain brown rice. Brown rice samples from MR-CTB51A, NPB-HP, and NPB-PF were stored at 4 \u00b0C for up to 1\u20132 weeks. MR-RNAi was stored at room temperature for 4 years. Brown rice samples were powdered and stored at -80 \u00b0C until use.\n</p>\nRef: </br>\n[1] Mejima M., Kashima K., Kuroda M., Takeyama N., Kurokawa S., Fukuyama Y., et al.

The suspension was shaken for 2 min at a frequency of 30 Hz in a mixer mill (Retsch MM400; Verder Scientific, Haan, Germany). After centrifugation (12,000 x g, 10 min), the supernatant was collected into a new 2-ml tube (Eppendorf), and the precipitate was re-extracted using the same procedure. The supernatants obtained after the first and second extractions were combined and mixed (vortex mixer). The supernatant (800 \u00b5l) was transferred to a new 2-ml tube (Eppendorf), and 500 \u00b5l of ultrapure water and 400 \u00b5l of chloroform were added to the tube and mixed (vortex mixer). After centrifugation (12,000 x g, 2 min), the upper phase (polar fraction) was separated from the lower phase and the inter-phase (non-polar fraction); fractions were lyophilized in 2-ml tubes (Eppendorf) in a centrifugal concentrator (CC-105; Tomy Seiko, Tokyo, Japan) for 6 h (polar fraction) or 1 h (non-polar fraction).\n</p>\nTransesterification of esterified fatty acids was performed using a base-catalyzed method [1]. Sodium methoxide (500 \u00b5l, approximately 30% in methanol; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, United States) was added to the dried non-polar fraction and incubated at 55 \u00b0C for 90 min with shaking (1000 rpm; Thermomixer Comfort, Eppendorf). Then, 1% acetic acid (1 ml) and chloroform (400 \u00b5l) were added to the tube and mixed (vortex mixer). After centrifugation (12,000 x g, 2 min), the upper phase was discarded, and ultrapure (1 ml) water was added to the tube. After centrifugation (12,000 x g, 2 min), the upper phase was discarded, and the remaining lower phase was lyophilized in the same centrifugal concentrator for 1 h.\n</p>\nMetabolites were derivatized using a combination of methoxamine hydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich) and N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA; Sigma-Aldrich). Methoxamine hydrochloride solution (20 \u00b5l; 40 mg/ml in pyridine) was added to the dried polar and non-polar fractions and incubated at 30 \u00b0C for 90 min with shaking (1,000 rpm; Thermomixer Comfort). Then, 80 \u00b5l of MSTFA was added and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min with shaking as above. The sample was centrifuged at 12,000 x g for 3 min, the supernatant was filtered through a hydrophilic polytetrafluoroethylene membrane filter unit (Millex-LG; Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany), and a 1-\u00b5l aliquot was used in the GC/TOF-MS analysis.\n</p>\nRef: </br>\n[1] Furuhashi T., Ogawa T., Nakai R., Nakazawa M., Okazawa A., Padermschoke A. et al.

Metabolite-candidate peaks were identified based on a Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficient (PPMCC) considering retention time and weighted mass spectrum between each metabolite-candidate peak and the compounds in our reference library. Out of the 351 metabolite-candidate peaks (198 metabolite-candidate peaks from the non-polar fraction and 153 metabolite-candidate peaks from the polar fraction), 212 were found to match (annotated peaks; identification score =0.600) the compounds stored in our reference library, and 139 did not match (unannotated peaks; identification score <0.600). These annotated peaks are shown with the library top hit compound name with the values of identification score given through the AIoutput2 peak identification processes.\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Tsugawa H., Tsujimoto Y., Arita M., Bamba T., Fukusaki E.
