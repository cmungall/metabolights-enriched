                "description": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) manifests as alterations in complex human behaviors including social communication and stereotypies. In addition to genetic risks, the gut microbiome differs between typically-developing (TD) and ASD individuals, though it remains unclear whether the microbiome contributes to symptoms. We transplanted gut microbiota from human donors with ASD and TD controls into germ-free mice, and reveal that colonization with ASD microbiota was sufficient to induce hallmark autistic behaviors. The brains of mice colonized with ASD microbiota display alternative splicing of ASD-relevant genes. Microbiome and metabolome profiles of mice harboring human microbiota predict that specific bacterial taxa and their metabolites modulate ASD behaviors. Indeed, treatment of an ASD mouse model with candidate microbial metabolites improves behavioral abnormalities and affects neuronal excitability in the brain. We propose that the gut microbiome modulates behaviors in mice via production of neuroactive metabolites, suggesting that gut-brain connections contribute to the pathophysiology of ASD.",

Human fecal samples were previously collected from typically developing children and children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) at ASU[1][2]. Briefly, parents collected and froze a single fecal sample from each subject. Frozen fecal samples were shipped overnight to ASD with a cold pack, and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. All fecal samples and their metadata including gastrointestinal (GI)- and ASD-relevant clinical data were de-identified before being shared with Caltech. DNA samples[1][2] were resequenced and analyzed as specified below.\n</br></br>\nMouse husbandry:</br>\nAll animal husbandry and experiments were approved by the Caltech Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC protocol no.1645). Throughout the study, colonized animals were maintained in autoclaved microisolator cages with autoclaved bedding (Aspen Chip Bedding, Northeastern Products Corp, Warrensburg, NY), water, and chow (Laboratory Autoclavable Rodent Diet - 5010, LabDiet; St. Louis, MO, USA). Mice were maintained at an ambient temperature of 71-75 \u00b0F, 30-70% humidity, at a cycle of 13 hr light and 11 hr dark.\n</br></br>\nMouse Colonization:</br>\nGerm-free (GF) C57BL/6J weanlings (3-4 weeks of age) from the Mazmanian laboratory colony were colonized with fecal samples from human donors. Human fecal samples were collected by the Krajmalnik-Brown laboratory at the Arizona State University as part of a previous study[1][2], and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. Aliquots of 16 donor samples were sent to Caltech and used for colonization into GF mice. To that end, frozen aliquots were thawed in an anaerobic chamber and resuspended in 2 volumes of reduced sodium bicarbonate solution (final concentration 5%; Life Technologies; Carlsbad, CA, USA). Subsequently, samples were vigorously vortexed and spun down. Supernatants were then used to colonize GF mice by a single oral gavage (100 \u03bcl/mouse; Instech, PA, USA). Colonized mice (4-6 females and 2-3 males per donor) were then allowed to rest for 3 weeks, and were subsequently mated according to donor. Pregnant dams were single-housed at E15.5-17.5, and offspring were weaned at 3 weeks of age. At weaning, different litters born within up to a week apart were combined and housed in groups of 4-5 male or female mice per cage and used for subsequent analyses. Cages were assigned to either behavior testing or for tissue collection. Behavior testing started at 6 weeks of age, while tissues were collected at P45. In the initial stage of this study, we colonized and subsequently behaviorally tested mice with fecal samples from 13 human male donors. Subsequently, we tested and analyzed a subset of representative samples (2 TD and 3 ASD) along with additional previously untested samples (1 TD and 2 ASD), to ensure there is no bias in sample selection.\n</br></br>\nTissue Collection:</br>\nOn P45, offspring mice were sacrificed by first administering 5% isoflurane by inhalation for 30 s followed by cervical dislocation. Subsequently, blood was collected by heart puncture into 1.1 ml z-gel serum collection tubes (Sarstedt; Germany). Serum was then collected according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions and stored frozen in \u221280 \u00b0C until analysis. Intestines were dissected, colon contents collected separately and flash frozen. To control any time of collection effects, mice from different groups were sacrificed in an alternating fashion. All samples were then assigned an identification number that prevented direct identification of the groups which helped facilitate a blind analysis of samples downstream.\n</br></br>\nDe-identified colon contents and serum samples were collected and flash-frozen at P45 without any buffers, and were shipped to the Department of Energy Pacific Northwest National Laboratory for metabolomic analysis by NMR and GC-MS.\n</br></br>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Kang DW, Park JG, Ilhan ZE, Wallstrom G, Labaer J, Adams JB, Krajmalnik-Brown R.

Feces were homogenized and weighed, and chilled methanol (\u221220 \u00b0C) was added proportionally to the colon content sample (1 ml to 100 mg). Glass beads were added and the suspension was agitated and sonicated to extract metabolites. Supernatant was collected after centrifugation (15,000 x g; 5 min at 4 \u00b0C) and 100 \u03bcl of each methanol layer was transferred to a new clean vial and subsequently dried under a speed-vacuum concentrator. 50 \u03bcl of serum samples were thawed and 200 \u03bcl of chilled methanol was added to denature proteins. Supernatants were collected after centrifugation (15,000 x g; 5 min at 4 \u00b0C). All the samples were then dried completely and stored at \u221270 \u00b0C freezer until the instrumental analysis.\n</br></br>\nPrior to analysis, the stored extracts were completely dried under speed-vacuum to remove moisture and were subsequently derivatized chemically, by methoxyamination and trimethylsilyation (TMS), as reported previously[2]. Briefly, methoxyamine (20 \u03bcl of a 30 mg/ml stock in pyridine) was added to each sample, followed by incubation at 37 \u00b0C with shaking for 90 min. subsequently, N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA) with 1% trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS) (80 \u03bcl) was added to each vial, and incubated at 37 \u00b0C with shaking for 30 min. Samples were then allowed to cool to room temperature and were analyzed on the same day.\n</br></br>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Deroussent A, Rodriguez S, Martelli S, Seck A, Dubus-Daudigeos E, Desma\u00eble D, Vassal G, Paci A.

Metabolites were initially identified by matching experimental spectra to a PNNL augmented version of Agilent GC-MS metabolomics Library, containing spectra and validated retention indices for over 850 metabolites. Subsequently, any unknown peaks were matched to the NIST14 GC-MS library. All metabolite identification and quantification ions were validated and confirmed to reduce deconvolution errors during automated data-processing and to eliminate false identifications.\n<br><br>\nFor the 1D 1H NMR spectra, candidate metabolites present in each of the complex mixture were determined by matching the chemical shift, J-coupling, and intensity information of experimental NMR signals against the NMR signals of standard metabolites in the Chenomx library which include metabolites from the HMDB database.",
