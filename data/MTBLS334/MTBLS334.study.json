                "description": "Introduction: Obestatin is a controversial gastrointestinal peptide purported to have metabolic actions. Objectives: This study investigated whether treatment with a stable obestatin analogue (PEG-OB(Cys10, Cys13) changed plasma metabolite levels firstly in lean and subsequently in diet-induced obesity (DIO) C57BL6/J mice. Method: Untargeted LC-HRMS metabolomics experiments were carried out in ESI+ mode with plasma extracts from both groups of animals. Data were normalised, multivariate and univariate statistical analysis performed and metabolites of interest putatively identified. Result: In lean mice, 39 metabolites were significantly changed by obestatin treatment and the majority of these were increased, including various C16 and C18 moieties of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine and monoacylglycerol, along with vitamin A, vitamin D3, tyrosine, acetylcarnitine and 2alpha-(hydroxymethyl)-5alpha-androstane-3beta,17beta-diol. Decreased concentrations of glycolithocholic acid, 3-dehydroteasterone and various phospholipids were observed. In DIO mice, 25 metabolites were significantly affected and strikingly, the magnitudes of changes here were generally much greater in DIO mice than in lean mice, and in contrast, the majority of metabolite changes were decreases. Four metabolites affected in both groups included glycolithocholic acid, and three different long-chain (C18) phospholipid molecules (phosphatidylethanolamine, platelet activating factor (PAF), and monoacylglycerol). Metabolites exclusively affected in DIO mice included various phosphatidylcholines, lysophosphatidylcholines and fatty acyls, as well as creatine and oxidised glutathione. Conclusion: This investigation demonstrates that obestatin treatment affects phospholipid turnover and influences lipid homeostasis, whilst providing convincing evidence that obestatin may be acting to ameliorate diet-induced impairments in lipid metabolism, and it may influence steroid, bile acid, PAF and glutathione metabolism.",

All experiments were performed in accordance with the Guidance on the Operation of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act, 1986 and approved by the Queen\u2019s University Belfast Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Body.  Lean mice (n=12) received a standard laboratory diet, composed of 16.4% protein, 4.0% fat and 48.5% carbohydrate (3.0 kcal/g; Teklad global rodent diet, Envigo, UK) for 23 weeks from birth. For the final 6 weeks animals were injected with either saline (n=6) or a modified obestatin peptide N-PEGylated(Cys10, Cys13)obestatin (n=6; PEG-OB (Cys10, Cys13)) (GL Biochem, China) at 50nmol/kg/day.  Injections were administered subcutaneously in the back of the neck at a volume of 10 ml/kg and the final weight range of the animals in each group was 25-33 g (saline) and 26-33 g (PEG-OB (Cys10, Cys13)).\n</p>\nIn a separate experiment the effects of PEG-OB(Cys10, Cys13) were investigated in DIO mice (n=11) which received a standard laboratory diet until 4 weeks of age, thereafter they received a high fat diet (20.5% protein, 36.0% fat and 35.7% carbohydrate (5.49 kcal/g; Mouse Diet, 60% Fat Calories, BioServ, USA) for 19 weeks.  For the final 6 weeks, mice were separated into two groups and injected with either saline (n=5) or PEG-OB(Cys10, Cys13) (n=6) at 50 nmol/kg/day as for lean mice. The final weight range of the DIO animals in each group was 39-55 g (saline) and 42-56 g (PEG-OB(Cys10, Cys13). At the end of the 23 week period, mice were fasted for 5 h were and sacrificed by CO2 asphyxiation 3 h after the onset of the light cycle and exactly 1 h after injection on the final day of treatment. Blood obtained by cardiac puncture was collected into pre-chilled heparinised tubes, centrifuged at 3000 x g for 10 min (4 \u00b0C) and the resulting plasma transferred to W/PTFE lined vials (Supelco, USA) prior to storage at -20 \u00b0C for metabolomic analysis.",

Prior to sample analysis 10 pooled conditioning samples were injected. To determine chromatographic reproducibility of retention times and peak intensities, pooled samples were injected after every 10 sample injections throughout the experiment [1].\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Graham, S.

A peak threshold filter of 2.5 AU was applied and peak picking thresholds were set between 0.5 and 20 minutes. Data were normalised to all compounds by correcting for multiple features to determine a global scaling factor. An output table was subsequently generated to include paired m/z retention times and raw and normalised peak intensities for pools and individual samples. These metabolic features were exported to Simca 14 (Umetrics, Umea, Sweden) for multivariate analysis by principal component analysis (PCA) and data quality was assessed via visualisation of clustering of pools and sample replicates. PCA observations were indicative of good platform stability. UPLC-MS acquired data for all samples (lean and DIO) were subsequently reanalysed using Progenesis QI as previously described.\n</p>\nOn the basis of normalised peak intensities, metabolic features were reduced by exclusion of those observations showing no change in magnitude (fold change = 1) and no significant statistical difference (P>0.05, students t-test). Metabolic features were reduced from 3819 to 736 and 3819 to 615 when PEG-OB(Cys10, Cys13) and saline treated mice were compared within lean and DIO groups respectively. This was carried out to avoid over-fitting and to improve the model\u2019s predictive ability. Using the average value for each biological replicate the filtered metabolic features were exported to Simca 14 (Umetrics, Umea, Sweden) for multivariate analysis. Data were mean centred, pareto scaled and grouped into PEG-OB(Cys10, Cys13) and saline treated groups for analysis using principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal projection to latent structures via partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA). The ions with the greatest influence on separation between PEG-OB(Cys10, Cys13) and saline treated animals were highlighted by the S-plots.",
