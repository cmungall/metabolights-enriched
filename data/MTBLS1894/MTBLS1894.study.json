                "description": "Rehabilitation using cryotherapy has widely been used in inflammatory diseases to relieve pain and decrease the disease activity. The aim of this study was to explore the metabolite changes in inflammatory knee-joint synovial fluids following local cryotherapy treatment (ice or cold CO2). We used proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy to assess the metabolite patterns in synovial fluid (SF) in patients with knee arthritis (n = 46) before (D0) and after (D1, 24 h later) two applications of local cryotherapy. Spectra from aqueous samples and organic extracts were obtained with an 11.75 Tesla spectrometer. The metabolite concentrations within the SF were compared between D1 and D0 using multiple comparisons with the application of a false discovery rate (FDR) adjusted at 10% for each metabolite. A total of 32 metabolites/chemical structures were identified including amino acids, organic acids, fatty acids or sugars. Pyruvate, alanine, citrate, threonine was significantly higher at D1 vs D0 (p < 0.05). Tyrosine concentration significantly decreases after cryotherapy application (p < 0.001). We did not observe any effect of gender and cooling technique on metabolite concentrations between D0 and D1 (p > 0.05). The present study provides new insight into a short-term effect of cold stimulus in synovial fluid from patients with knee arthritis. Our observations suggest that the increased level of metabolites involved in energy metabolism may explain the underlying molecular pathways that mediate the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory capacities of cryotherapy.",

They were enrolled in the investigation, which was declared and approved by the local ethics committee (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT03850392, Comit\u00e9 de Protection des Personnes - Est II: 12-664). The patients received no biological or conventional DMARD treatment for 6 months before inclusion. They did not received any local cryotherapy in the month before inclusion.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Study Design and Patient Sample collection:</strong></p><p>The patients were then randomized to receive either local ice (Thermogel\u00ae, Artsana, Grandate, Italy; 30-min application; N = 30) or hyperbaric cold CO2 at -78 \u00b0C (Cryo+\u00ae, Cryonic, Salins-les-Bains, France; 2-min application; N =16). They received 2 applications of cooling technique (ice or cold CO2) at an 8-h interval (9 a.m. and 5 p.m.). Synovial fluid (SF) samples were taken from the knee joint on D0 (just before the first application of cold) then D1 (24 h later) at the same time of the day in order to limit the risk of bias linked to circadian variations. The SF specimens collected in syringe were transferred to Falcon tubes (15ml) and centrifuged twice at 2500 x g at 4 \u00b0C for 15 min. Supernatants were then frozen at -80 \u00b0C into 500 \u00b5l Eppendorf tubes. No blood contamination was observed.</p>",

Typical processing parameters were application of Fourier transform without line broadening or zero filling. Chemical shifts (\u03b4 in ppm) were reported relative to the signal of the TSP or TMS at 0 ppm. Phase correction and baseline correction were corrected manually when needed. Isolated signal integrations were performed relative to reference signal (TSP or TMS).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Organic extracts:</strong></p><p>Signals were integrated relative to TMS signal which remained the same in all spectra. Integrated signals corresponding to a chemical function/pattern with a group of metabolites were studied. No absolute quantitation was performed.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Aqueous samples:</strong></p><p>The TSP peak was also used as reference for quantification. Calibration of TPS peak, which had the same intensity in all spectra, was established from a 3 mM creatine solution containing TPS. The concentrations in the NMR tube of each metabolites were calculated in mM per litre. Metabolites concentration in the SF was then corrected according to dilution factors as presented in the sample preparation section.<strong><br></strong></p>",
