                "description": "Toxoplasma gondii poses a great threat to human health, with no approved vaccine available for the treatment of T. gondii infection. T. gondii infections are not limited to the brain, and may also affect other organs especially the liver. Identification of host liver molecules or pathways involved in T. gondii replication process may lead to the discovery of novel anti-T. gondii targets. Here, we analyzed the metabolic profile of the liver of mice on 11 and 30 days postinfection (dpi) with type II T. gondii Pru strain. Global metabolomics using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) identified 389 significant metabolites from acutely infected mice; and 368 from chronically infected mice, when compared with control mice. Multivariate statistical analysis revealed distinct metabolic signatures from acutely infected, chronically infected and control mice. Infection influenced several metabolic processes, in particular those for lipids and amino acids. Metabolic pathways, such as steroid hormone biosynthesis, primary bile acid biosynthesis, bile secretion, and biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids were perturbed during the whole infection process, particularly during the acute stage of infection. The present results provide insight into hepatic metabolic changes that occur in BALB/c mice during acute and chronic T. gondii infection.",

Mice were housed in microisolator cages under specific-pathogen free (SPF) conditions, with controlled temperature (22 \u00b1 2 \u00b0C) and 12 h light/dark cycles, and were given water and standard food pellets ad libitum. Mice were randomly allocated into 3 groups: acutely infected group (n = 13), chronically infected group (n = 13) and healthy uninfected group (n = 13). Each mouse in the infected group was infected orally with 10 tissue cysts of T. gondii type II Pru strain that were isolated from mice brain 40 days postinfection (dpi) in 100 \u03bcl phosphate buffered saline solution (PBS). Control mice were gavaged with 100 \u03bcl PBS only. All mice were observed daily for the development of clinical signs and for survival throughout the entire experiment. Also, weight loss was monitored as a sign of morbidity.\n</br></br>\nAt 11 days postinfection (dpi), 10 mice from the acutely infected group were sacrificed and their livers were collected. A further 10 mice representing chronically infected group, and 10 uninfected controls, were sacrificed and their livers were collected at 30 dpi. Livers were rapidly removed, cut into small pieces, rinsed with saline solution (0.9% NaCl w/v), snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C.",

Then, 800 \u03bcl methanol/water (1:1) solution and 3 mm (mean diameter) steel beads were added to each sample. Using a TissueLyser bead-mill homogenizer (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany), samples were homogenized via vibrating at 60 Hz for 5 min. Subsequently, samples were centrifuged at 25,000 x g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C. To evaluate the reproducibility and stability of the LC-MS/MS system, 200 \u03bcl supernatant of each sample was mixed to generate a pooled quality control (QC) sample. The supernatant from each sample was separated and freeze dried. Finally, dried supernatant samples were reconstituted in deionized water and analyzed by mass spectrometry.",

For the negative ionization mode, these parameters were set at 1 kV and 40 V, respectively. Centroid MSE mode was used to obtain the mass spectrometry data. The primary scan ranged from 50 Da to 1200 Da with a scanning time of 0.2 s. All the parent ionizations were fragmented at 20-40 V and the information from the fragments was collected. During data acquisition, the LE signal was gained every 3 s for real-time quality correction. Furthermore, quality control samples (10 samples) were collected in order to evaluate the stability of the instrument during measurements.",

                        "description": "UPLC-MS/MS raw data files were imported into Progenesis QI software (version 2.2) (Waters, UK). Data were processed for possible adducts, peak alignment, peak detection, deconvolution, dataset filtering, noise reduction, compound identification, and normalization with sum method. Chromatograms were aligned to a reference QC run and selected adducts included [M+H]+, [M+Na]+, [M+K]+, [M+NH4]+ for ESI+ and [M\u2212H]\u2212, [M+Cl]\u2212 for ESI\u2013 with 2.5 AU filter. Peak picking was set to exclude ions eluted before 0.5 min and after 9 min at 1% and 92% organic solution, respectively. The raw data were normalized using a global scaling factor to align all injections to a reference run by adjusting for the quantitative abundance of each detectable feature, correcting for experimental variation based on deviation from the median. The results were exported in.CSV format for further analysis and reporting of selected ions by their accurate mass and retention time pair. The normalized peak data were further processed by an in-house software metaX[1]. Those features that were detected in less than 50% of QC samples or 80% of biological samples were removed, and the remaining peaks with missing values were imputed with the k-nearest neighbor algorithm to further improve the data quality. Then, the ions that demonstrated relative standard deviation (RSD) greater than 30% in QC pools were filtered out.\n</br></br>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Wen B, Mei Z, Zeng C, Liu S. metaX: a flexible and comprehensive software for processing metabolomics data.

The differential metabolites with a mass accuracy of 10 ppm were selected when the variable influence on projection (VIP) values extracted from the PLS-DA model were larger than 1.0, and the p values obtained from a two-tailed Student\u2019s t-test on the normalized peak areas were less than 0.05. Meanwhile, fold change (FC) had to be more than 1.2 or less than 0.8333. Log2 FC based on metabolite abundance was used to show how these differential metabolites varied between groups. The data converted to log2 format was performed for cluster analysis with the pheatmap package of R statistical language.\n</br></br>\nMetabolite identification was performed by matching the exact molecular mass data (m/z) of samples with the online HMDB (http://www.hmdb.ca/) and KEGG (www.genome.jp/kegg/) databases. A mass error range of 10 ppm was set to match the compound and obtain a mass accuracy score[1]. Progenesis QI software was used to match the theoretical isotope distribution in the database, and obtain the isotopic similarity score of the metabolites. Then, all the possible compounds corresponding to each parent ion in the first-order spectrum were theoretically fragmented according to their molecular structure to obtain the theoretical fragment ions. The spectra of all theoretical fragment ions together formed the theoretical secondary spectrum. Then, we set the mass error range of 10 ppm, and matched the actual secondary spectrum of the experimental samples with the theoretical secondary spectrum. Scores of the matching similarity between the spectra were counted. Finally, the 3 scores were combined into total assessment scores, which were used to screen the metabolites.\n</br></br>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Zhong H, Fang C, Fan Y, Lu Y et al.
