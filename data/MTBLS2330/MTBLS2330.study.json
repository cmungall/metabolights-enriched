                "description": "<p><strong>AIM:</strong> We aimed to study the impact of water deficit on the concentration of key flavour and phenolic secondary metabolites of wines.</p><p><strong>METHODS AND RESULTS:</strong> A drought-stress field trial was conducted on Vitis vinifera cv. Merlot and Tocai Friulano for two seasons. Fully irrigated (C) and deficit irrigated (D) grapes were microvinified and the resulting wines were analysed to determine the concentrations of anthocyanins, tannins, and free and glycosidically-bound Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs). A descriptive sensory test was undertaken on the same wines. Water stressed grapes produced wines with higher concentrations of anthocyanins in Merlot and of free and glycosidically-bound monoterpenes in Tocai Friulano. Both cultivars displayed higher amounts of glycosidically-bound C13-norisoprenoids.</p><p><strong>CONCLUSIONS:</strong> Previously observed drought-induced compositional changes to the grapes were transfered to the wines, with an increase in polyphenols and VOCs. However, the timing and the duration of the water stress in the field only heavily impacted the final wine composition with major metabolic modification when the severe water deficit started early (at approximately 40 days after anthesis) and lasted over the entire season until harvest. </p><p><strong>SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY:</strong> This study highlights the positive role of a controlled water deficit on the composition of the wines in terms of secondary metabolites.</p>",

                        "description": "<p><strong>Experimental design:</strong></p><p>The field experiment was conducted on Merlot and Tocai Friulano vines in the experimental vineyard of the University of Udine (Italy) in 2011 and 2012. Detailed vineyard descriptions have previously been described<strong>[1]-[3]</strong>. Merlot vines were covered with an open-sided plastic film of ethylene-vinyl-acetate (EVA, Patilux, Italy) at the beginning of the season until harvest, while Tocai Friulano vines grew uncovered in the open field. 2 different irrigation treatments, fully irrigated vines as the <strong>control (C) </strong>and <strong>deficit irrigated vines (D)</strong>, were established at approximately 25 <strong>d after anthesis (DAA)</strong> and applied until harvest<strong>[2][3]</strong>. Each irrigation treatment was replicated on 4 plots (each consisting of 10 vines) arranged in a completely randomised design. Plant water status was monitored weekly by measuring \u03a8Stem using a Scholander pressure chamber. The accumulated water deficit integral (S\u03a8) was calculated for each variety and year separately from the weekly stem water potential (\u03a8Stem) measurements as previously reported<strong>[4]</strong>. The grapes were harvested at 115 and 106 DAA for Merlot and at 105 and 93 DAA for Tocai Friulano in 2011 and 2012 respectively. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Microvinification and wine analysis:</strong></p><p>Wines were produced for each of the 2 growing seasons with a standard microvinification protocol developed by the Viticulture and Oenology Research Group at the University of Udine (Italy), as previously described[1], with slight differences between red and white vinification.</p><p><br></p><p>For both Merlot and Tocai Friulano, an average of 18 kg grapes from each treatment replicate were harvested manually and transported to the experimental winery of the University of Udine. Grapes from the single replicate/plot were kept separately, except for Tocai Friulano in 2012 when the yield per plot was low, and the grapes of the fourth plot were distributed among the others within the same treatment to reach the desired mass for fermentation.</p><p><br></p><p>Overall, for Merlot and Tocai Friulano in the 2 seasons, 30 independent fermentations were carried out. Each lot was mechanically de-stemmed and crushed. For Tocai Friulano, the skins and seeds were separated using a manual press. The Merlot juice with skins and seeds and the Tocai Friulano clear juice were each transferred to a separate 20 L glass fermentation container. 35 mg/kg of sulfur dioxide (SO2) were added to Merlot and 50 mg/l of SO2 to Tocai Friulano, and then both were inoculated with 0.2 g/l of a commercial yeast strain (Lalvin EC-1118, Lallemand Inc.). Musts were fermented at 18 \u00b0C for 10 days. A punch-down was performed twice a day for Merlot. After alcoholic fermentation, Merlot wines were pressed, and 25 mg/l of SO2 was added, while Tocai Friulano wines were racked and 50 mg/l of SO2 was added. Both Merlot and Tocai Friulano wines were racked twice, at 10 and 30 d after the end of fermentation and then bottled in 0.5 L bottles closed with synthetic stoppers. Malolactic fermentation was not carried out. Alcohol content, titratable acidity, pH and dry extract were determined, as previously described<strong>[1]</strong>, for both Merlot and Tocai Friulano wines. Wine colour intensity (OD420 nm + OD520 nm), colour hue (OD420 nm/OD520 nm), and the concentrations of anthocyanins, tannins and small and large polymeric pigments (SPP and LPP) were determined for Merlot wines by spectrophotometric analyses, as described previously<strong>[1]</strong>. The wines were stored in the dark at 4 \u00b0C. All the analyses were done when the wines were aged 9-10 mth.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Herrera JC, Bucchetti B, Sabbatini P, Comuzzo P, Zulini L, Vecchione A, Peterlunger E, Castellarin SD (2015).

Briefly, solid-phase extraction was performed using Isolute ENV+ cartridges, 1 g (Biotage, Sweden). The cartridge was pre-conditioned with 15 ml methanol, followed by 20 ml of Milli-Q water. 50 ml of wine was diluted with 50 mL of Milli-Q water and 0.1 ml of internal standard n-heptanol (250 mg/l) was added. This was then loaded onto the cartridge and washed with 15 ml of Milli-Q water to remove possible impurities. The free volatile compounds were eluted from the cartridge with 30 ml of dichloromethane; the solution was added with 60 ml of pentane, dried with sodium sulfate anhydrous (Na2SO4) and concentrated to 1 ml on a Vigreux column. The glycosidically-bound volatile precursors were eluted with 30 ml of methanol and evaporated until dry by using a rotary vacuum evaporator. The flasks were washed with a solution of pentane-dichloromethane (2:1 v/v) to remove any residual traces of free VOCs. The bound fraction was then re-dissolved in 4 mL of citrate buffer at pH 5; 200 \u03bcl of enzyme AR2000 (70 mg/ml) (DSM Food Specialties B.V., Netherlands)<strong>[3]</strong> was added and tubes were kept in a 40 \u00b0C bath at dark for 24 h. After the addition of 10 \u03bcl of internal standard (n-heptanol), the compounds were extracted 3x with 2 ml of pentane/dichloromethane (2:1 v/v). The organic phase containing the free released volatiles was collected, dried with Na2SO4 anhydrous, and then concentrated to 0.5 ml on the Vigreux column.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Boido E, Lloret A, Medina K, Fari\u00f1a L, Carrau F, Versini G, Dellacassa E.

GC separation was performed on a 30 m VF-WAXms capillary column with an internal diameter of 0.25mm and a film thickness of 0.25 m (J&amp;W Scientific, Inc. CA) injecting a volume of 1 \u03bcl. Run conditions are were reported previously<strong>[1]</strong>. Temperature programme: 40 \u00b0C hold for 2 min after injection, 10 \u00b0C/min up to 50 \u00b0C, 1.4 \u00b0C/min up to 60 \u00b0C, hold for 2 min, 1.6 \u00b0C/min up to 70 \u00b0C, hold for 1 min, 2.2 \u00b0C/min up to 100 \u00b0C, hold for 0.5 min, 3.1 \u00b0C/min up to 140 \u00b0C, 4.4 \u00b0C/min up to 200 \u00b0C, 12 \u00b0C/min up to 250 \u00b0C, hold for 6 min.
