                "description": "<h4><strong>INTRODUCTION: </strong>Although sarcopenia greatly affects health and quality of life in older people, its pathophysiological causes are not fully elucidated. To face this challenge, omics technologies can be used. The metabolome gives a vision of the interaction between the genome and the environment through metabolic networks, thus contributing in clarifying the pathophysiology of the sarcopenic phenotype.</h4><h4><strong>OBJECTIVES: </strong>The main goal of this study was to compare the plasma metabolome of sarcopenic and non-sarcopenic older people.</h4><h4><strong>METHODS: </strong>Cross-sectional study of 20 sarcopenic and 21 non-sarcopenic older subjects with available frozen plasma samples. Non-targeted metabolomic study by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS) analysis with later bioinformatics data analysis. Once the significantly different metabolites were identified, the KEGG database was used on them to establish which were the metabolic pathways mainly involved.</h4><h4><strong>RESULTS: </strong>From 657 features identified, 210 showed significant differences between the study groups, and 30 had a FoldChangeLog<sub>2</sub>\u2009&gt;\u20092. The most interesting metabolic pathways found with the KEGG database were the biosynthesis of amino acids, arginine and proline metabolism, the biosynthesis of alkaloids derived from ornithine, linoleic acid metabolism, and the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids.</h4><h4><strong>CONCLUSIONS: </strong>The study results allowed us to confirm that the concept of 'sarcopenic phenotype' is also witnessed at the plasma metabolite levels. The non-targeted metabolomics study can open a wide view of the sarcopenic features changes at the plasma level, which would be linked to the sarcopenic physiopathological alterations.</h4>",

Then, 10 \u03bcl of a mix of isotopically modfied standards was added to all samples and quality controls as internal standards. The standard metabolite mix consisted of 7-propil theophylline (2 ng/\u03bcl), D3-ephedrine (5 ng/\u03bcl), D3-mefruside (2 ng/\u03bcl), D3-morphine 5 ng/\u03bcl), and D3-testosterone (1 ng/\u03bcl) (obtained from Cambridge Isotopes, UK, NMI, Australia, Sigma, USA, Logical, Germany).

Chromatographic separations were obtained using a 2.1 x 50 mm ZORBAX 1.8 \u03bcm C18 column (Agilent, USA). The mobile phases used were the following: phase A was water with 0.1% formic acid and 5 mM ammonium formate and phase B was methanol with 0.1% formic acid. The total run time was 15.2 min. The first 2.4 min of the run consisted of a linear gradient from 10 to 60% of phase B, followed by 12.0 min of linear gradient from 60 to 98% of phase B. After reaching 98%, a stable run with 98% of phase B was sustained for 1.53 min followed by 1.53 min of 10% of phase B solution to regenerate the column. Solvents were pumped at 450 \u03bcl/ min with a column temperature of 55 \u00b0C, and the sample chamber was held at 7 \u00b0C.</p><p><br></p><p>Between each chromatography sample, a washing protocol with 1 \u03bcl of phase A solution was performed. The LC-MS/MS system was conditioned before the analysis, running non-experimental samples using the same procedures as performed in the experimental samples. The system suitability was monitored by analyzing the retention time, peak shape and intensity of spiked internal standards. The UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS analysis also included quality control (QC) samples, which were injected and analyzed at 5 different times during the experiment in the same way as the experimental samples to assess the equipment stability. The QC was prepared using 10 \u03bcl of each experimental sample and submitted for the same experimental procedures as performed in the experimental samples.</p>",

In the non-targeted method, the identification of non-novel metabolites was based on accurate mass and tandem mass spectra, without chemical standard references, providing a level 2 identification (putatively annotated), and the samples were analyzed in triplicate. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to evaluate the experimental reproducibility, and the QC samples were used to identify reproducibility throughout the experiments (see <strong>Fig. SF1</strong> in the paper associated with this study). Data of the triplicate injection experiments were unified, and the average value of the 3 experiments was used as a unique value. Before statistical analysis, data were scaled by auto-scaling (mean-centered and divided by the standard deviation of each feature).</p><p><br></p><p>Principal component analysis (PCA) for the metabolite matrix was performed by <strong>FactoMineR</strong>, an R package<strong>[5]</strong>. The number of dimensions included in the PCA analysis was determined by cross-validation approximations<strong>[6]</strong>. For statistical analysis, the p-value was calculated by the Mann\u2013Whitney\u2013Wilcoxon test, to compare the chromatographic areas for each discriminant compound between each studied class (sarcopenic\u2013non sarcopenic), with a significance level of 0.05. Then, all significant comparisons were adjusted using <strong>false discovery rate FDR</strong>, using <strong>BH correction[7]</strong> with a p-value \u2264 0.12; to be considered statistically different. Later, for each of these compounds, the <strong>FoldChangeLog2</strong> was calculated to select the features with higher differences in plasma levels between the groups.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Pence HE, Williams A.
