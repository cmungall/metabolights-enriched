                "description": "<p>The common cutworm (CCW; <em>Spodoptera litura</em>) is one of the major insect pests of soybean in Asia and Oceania. Although quantitative trail loci related to CCW resistance have been introduced into leading soybean cultivars, these do not exhibit sufficient resistance against CCW. Thus, understanding the genetic and metabolic resistance mechanisms of CCW as well as integrating other new resistance genes are required. In this study, we focused on a primitive soybean landrace, Peking, which has retained resistances to various pests. We found a resistance to CCW in Peking by the detached-leaf feeding assay, and subsequently determined the genetic and metabolic basis of the resistance mechanism using chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSLs) of Peking. Several characteristic metabolites for Peking were identified by the metabolomic approach using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry combined with a principle component analysis. The structure of seven metabolites were determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis. The genomic segments of Peking on chromosome 06 (Chr06) and Chr20 had a clear association with these metabolites. Moreover, a line possessing a Peking genomic segment on Chr20 inhibited growth of the CCW. The genetic factors and the metabolites on Chr20 in Peking will be useful for understanding mechanisms underlying CCW resistance and breeding resistant soybean cultivars.</p>",
