                "description": "<p>Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are recognized as direct seeds of metastasis. However, CTC count may not be the 'best' indicator of metastatic risk because their heterogeneity is generally neglected. In this study, we develop a molecular typing system to predict colorectal cancer metastasis potential based on the metabolic fingerprints of single CTCs. After identification of the metabolites potentially related to metastasis using mass spectrometry-based untargeted metabolomics, setup of a home-built single-cell quantitative mass spectrometric platform for target metabolite analysis in individual CTCs and use of a machine learning method composed of non-negative matrix factorization and logistic regression, CTCs are divided into two subgroups, C1 and C2, based on a 4-metabolite fingerprint. Both <em>in vitro</em> and <em>in vivo</em> experiments demonstrate that CTC count in C2 subgroup is closely associated with metastasis incidence. This is an interesting report on the presence of a specific population of CTCs with distinct metastatic potential at the single-cell metabolite level. </p>",

Pretreatment procedures were performed, including peak finding, alignment, filtering and normalization. More specifically, the peaks that exceeded 10,000 in height were automatically extracted and aligned across the samples.

The ion intensities were normalized by protein amount, internal standard acetaminophen (m/z 150.0548 for negative ion mode, m/z 152.0701 for positive ion mode) and quality controls<strong>[3]</strong>. The resulting data could be converted to a matrix, which mainly includes the sample name, m/z and adduct type, and normalized ion intensity.

The intersection of the identified metabolites with significantly differential abundance obtained from the two pairs of cell lines was selected.
