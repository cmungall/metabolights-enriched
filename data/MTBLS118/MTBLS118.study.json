                "description": "Here we present a metabolic profiling strategy employing direct infusion Orbitrap mass spectrometry (MS) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) for the monitoring of soybean's (Glycine max L.) global metabolism regulation in response to Rhizoctonia solani infection in a time-course. Key elements in the approach are the construction of a comprehensive metabolite library for soybean, which accelerates the steps of metabolite identification and biological interpretation of results, and bioinformatics tools for the visualization and analysis of its metabolome. The study of metabolic networks revealed that infection results in the mobilization of carbohydrates, disturbance of the amino acid pool, and activation of isoflavonoid, \u03b1-linolenate and phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathways of the plant. Components of these pathways include phytoalexins, coumarins, flavonoids, signaling molecules, and hormones, many of which exhibit antioxidant properties and bioactivity helping the plant to counterattack the pathogen's invasion. Unraveling the biochemical mechanism operating during soybean-Rhizoctonia interaction in addition to its significance towards the understanding of the plant's metabolism regulation under biotic stress, provides valuable insights with potential for applications in biotechnology, crop breeding, and agrochemical and food industries.",

For pre-germination, seeds were placed on sterilized moistened filter paper (Whatman No 1, 11 cm diameter) in Petri plates, and kept at 24 \u00b0C in the dark. Uniformly pre-germinated seeds were planted in sterile mix of turf:perlite (1:1, v/v) in plastic trays in the dark in a growth chamber at 22\u00b12 \u00b0C and relative humidity of 85%. Sterile water was added every second day. Seedlings were etiolated in order to provide longer lengths of hypocotyls for inoculation. They were grown for one week to approximately 15 cm height before they were gently removed and inoculated.\n</p>\nFor the production of the inoculum, starter cultures of the highly pathogenic R. solani AG4 isolate A76, provided by M. Cubeta (N. Carolina University, USA), were grown on potato dextrose agar (PDA) for three days. Uniform and healthy one-week-old seedlings were transferred to sterile Pyrex glass trays (38 x 27 x 6 cm) on filter paper (Whatman No 1), arranged horizontally, and their roots were covered with sterile moistened cotton. For the analysis of hyphae, the fungus was grown on cellophane membrane.\n</p>\nInoculation was performed by sandwiching hypocotyls between two PDA strips (2 cm x 8 cm) of 3-day-old Rhizoctonia cultures or clean strips (control) in sterile environment under photosynthetically inactive black light (365 nm) on designated marked sites of the hypocotyls, 3 cm away from the roots. Trays were wrapped with plastic membrane, and returned to growth chambers for incubation at 24 \u00b0C, in the dark. The development of necrotic lesions was stereoscopically observed and plants were harvested 24 and 48 h post-inoculation, and prepared for metabolite extraction. These time points were specifically chosen in order to capture the onset of infection and the development of infection cushions. Each treatment (infected or control) was consisted of five biological replications, each obtained by pooling the hypocotyls of four seedlings.\n</p>\nSamples (100 mg of fresh weight, fw) were harvested from the edges of necrotic lesions at 24 h and 48 h post-inoculation and corresponding portions of control seedlings.

Santa Clara, CA, USA) coupled with a 5975C series mass selective detector (MSD) and a 7693A series autosampler was employed. Samples (1 \u00b5l) were injected using a split ratio of 10:1 into a HP-5MS ultra inert (UI) capillary column (30 m x 250 \u00b5m I.D, 0.25 \u00b5m film thickness; Agilent Technologies Inc.). Helium was used as the carrier gas at a constant flow rate of 1 ml/min. The temperature of the oven was initially 70 \u00baC stable for 5 min, followed by a 5 \u00baC/min increase to 310 \u00baC and finally stable for 1 min.\n</p>\nFor each treatment, a quality control (QC) sample was obtained by pooling 25 \u00b5l from each of the five biological replicates (total 125 \u00b5l), and analyzed. In addition to biological replications and QC samples, technical one replication for randomly selected samples was performed per treatment. Following each sample's analysis, a blank (solvent system only) was injected to ensure that no carry over is observed between samples. Additionally, blank samples were used for the detection of possible contamination during the different experimental steps, such as material and reagent impurities and column stationary phase bleeding (for GC/MS). For this purpose, 1.5 ml of the extraction solvent mixture was processed alongside the experimental samples and was subjected to identical handling. Results were taken into account for the detection of metabolites not related to the biological material that was analyzed, which were subsequently excluded from analyses. Additionally, the metabolic composition of fungal samples was taken into consideration, in order to remove fungal-derived metabolites that could influence the biological interpretation of results. In order to optimize the performance of analyzers, calibration was performed at the beginning of analyses following the recommended by the manufacturers' procedures and using calibration solutions.\n</p>\nFor GC/MS, tuning of the MS detector was performed automatically using the AutoTune function of the Agilent MSD Chemstation. The DRO/GRO Range Calibration Standard was injected every six samples in order to monitor the performance of the system and additionally, samples were spiked by adding 20 \u00b5l of ribitol solution (0.2 mg/ml) to methanol-water (50\u201350, v/v), which served as the internal standard.",

                        "description": "In order to develop a high-throughput metabolomics protocol, identification was performed following a biologically-driven approach. Central to this approach is the species-specific in-house built library for soybean composed of 1339 metabolites, which includes information on metabolite monoisotopic mass, molecular formula, biosynthetic pathways, and chemical classification. For the construction of the library, information was retrieved from the publicly available databases of SoyCyc, KEGG, EMBL-EBI, KNApSAcK, and the literature. For standardization purposes, the KEGG coding system for pathways was adapted, which enables the comprehensive grouping of pathways and is compatible with bioinformatics tools such as the pathway tools of BioCyc. For the chemical classification of metabolites, information was retrieved from the database PubChem.\n</p>\nFor GC/MS, the guidelines of the metabolomics standards initiative (MSI) [1] were followed. Mass spectra searches were performed against the library of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (Gaithersburg, MD, USA) NIST 08 and for selected signatory metabolites, absolute identification was based on fragmentation patterns and retention times (RT) analyzing authentic chemical standards on the same GC/MS system with the same analytical method [1]. In cases in which a very good fit (e.g,>90%) could be achieved, tentative identification was performed. Metabolites of non-biological origin were excluded from further analysis.\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Sumner LW, Amberg A, Barrett D, Beale MH, Beger R, Daykin CA, Fan TW, Fiehn O, Goodacre R, Griffin JL, Hankemeier T, Hardy N, Harnly J, Higashi R, Kopka J, Lane AN, Lindon JC, Marriott P, Nicholls AW, Reily MD, Thaden JJ, Viant MR.
