                        "description": "Reactor A is a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) with 5.4 l working volume was inoculated with activated sludge obtained from an existing EBPR enrichment reactor, with a protocol designed to enrich for known PAO species from genus Candidatus Accumulibacter.  The SBR was operated with 6 h cycles, including a feeding (60 min) stage, an anaerobic stage (20 min), an aerobic stage (180 min), and a settling/decant stage (100 min). In each cycle, 2.35 l of synthetic wastewater composed of 0.53 l of solution A (containing 1.02g/l NH4Cl, 1.2 g/l MgSO4 7H2O, 0.01 g/l peptone, 0.01 g/l yeast extract and 6.8 g/l sodium acetate) and 1.82 l of solution B (0.312 g/l K2HPO4 3H2O, 0.185 g/l KH2PO4, 0.75 mg/l FeCl3 6H2O 0.015 mg/l CuSO4 5H2O, 0.03 mg/l MnCl2, 0.06 mg/l ZnSO4, 0.075 mg/l CoCl2, 0.075 mg/l H3BO3, 0.09 mg/l KI and 0.06 mg/l Na2MoO4 2H2O) (modified as previously described[1]) was introduced into the reactor continuously (in 60 min). The reactor was operated at 31 \u00b0C with a HRT and a SRT of 12 h and 7 days, respectively. The pH was controlled at 7.20-7.60 with DO levels maintained at 0.8-1.2 mg/l during the aerobic phase.\n</br></br>\nReactor B is a 5-l SBR containing an EBPR microbial consortia was fed with synthetic wastewater containing glucose as the main carbon source. The cycle duration was 6 h and consisted of 30 min feeding, 125 min anaerobic, 154 min aerobic, 1 min sludge discharge, 35 min settling and 15 min supernatant discharge phases. The HRT was 15 h. The feed composition was adapted from a previously published method[1] and split into 0.3 and 1.7 l of solutions A and B fed to the reactor, respectively. Solution A contained (per litre): 1,852.8 mg of glucose anhydrous, 637.5 mg of NH4Cl, 6.25 mg of peptone, 6.25 mg of yeast extract, 750 mg of MgSO4\u00b77H2O, 118.75 mg of CaCl2\u00b72H2O and 401.6 mg of N-Allylthiourea to inhibit nitrification. Feed solution B contained (per litre): 73.20 mg of K2HPO4\u00b73H2O, 43.65 mg of KH2PO4, 0.55 ml of trace elements solution 1 and 0.55 ml of trace elements solution 2. The trace elements solutions included (per litre and adapted from a previusly described procedure[2]: solution 1: 1.5 g of FeCl3\u00b76H2O, 0.03 g of CuSO4\u00b75H2O, 0.12 g of MnCl2\u00b74H2O, 0.12 g of ZnSO4\u00b77H2O, 0.15 g of CoCl2\u00b76H2O and 0.1 g of EDTA disodium salt, and solution 2: 0.15 g of H3BO3, 0.18 g of KI, 0.06 g of Na2MoO4\u00b72H2O. Nitrogen gas was spurge into the reactor during the anaerobic phase, while air was supplied during the aerobic phase to maintain a dissolved oxygen concentration between 0.5 and 1 mg/l. The temperature was set at 31\u00b11 \u00b0C and pH was controlled at 7.5\u00b10.25 by using 0.5 M NaOH and 0.5 M HCl.\n</br></br>\nWe obtained samples from Reactor A and Reactor B during one 6h cycle study. For Reactor A, the sampled time points were at 30 min, 70 min, 95 min and 200 min relative to the start of the feeding phase. For Reactor B, the sampled time points were at 30 min and 95 min relative to the start of the cycle. At each time point, a 150 ml aliquot of activated sludge was sampled. 3 technical replicates were obtained from each sampled aliquot. The samples were centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 1 min at 4 \u00b0C. Cell pellets and supernatant were separated and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80\u00b0 C before lyophilization. For Reactor A, only the pellets were used to extract intracellular metabolites, while both pellet and supernatant were used to extract extra- and intracellular metabolites for the Reactor B. In order to normalize the sample volume, 10 ml of supernatant from each sample was lyophilized. After lyophilization, the samples were subjected to different metabolite extraction methods.\n</br></br>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Lu H, Oehmen A, Virdis B, Keller J, Yuan Z.

For reactor A, we tested all 5 extraction solutions were tested to examine the entire cellular components of intracellular metabolites, while for reactor B, M, MW1 and MCW were applied to extract extra- and intracellular metabolites. </p><p><strong>Methanol and methanol:water extraction:</strong></p><p>In each case of different methanol extraction (M, MW1, MW2 and MW3), 20 mg of lyophilized pellet powder from each sample was extracted using 1 ml of extraction solution. After sonication for 10 min, the samples were centrifuged at 13000 rpm at 4 \u00b0C for 5 min and the supernatant was collected. Extraction was repeated by adding another 1 ml of extraction solution to the pellet. After centrifugation, the supernatant from the 2 extractions were combined, dried by vacuum evaporator and stored at -80 \u00b0C for further analysis. The extraction procedure was the same for the extracellular metabolites by using rotary shaker for 15 min instead sonication. </p><p><strong>Methanol:chloroform:water extraction:</strong></p><p>For the extraction of the polar and non-polar metabolites, 20 mg of powder from each lyophilized pellet sample was extracted using 1 ml of a mixture of water/methanol/chloroform (20:40:40). After vortexing for 1 min, the samples were put in an orbital shaker for 15 min at room temperature. Samples were centrifuged at 13000 rpm and 4 \u00b0C for 10 min, and the upper phases constituted of aqueous methanol extract were collected. Extraction was repeated by adding another 600 \u00b5l of water/methanol (1:2) to the pellet and chloroform fractions and shaking for 15 min. After centrifugation, the upper phases from the 2 extractions were combined, dried by vacuum evaporator and stored at -80 \u00b0C for further analysis. The chloroform phase was also collected in a separated tube, dried by vacuum evaporator and stored at -80 \u00b0C for the analysis of non-polar metabolites. The same extraction procedure was performed for extracellular metabolites by using rotary shaker for 15 min instead of sonication. </p><p><br></p><p>Dried samples of M, MW1, MW2, MW3 and aqueous fraction of MCW extraction were reconstituted with 400 \u00b5l of water (LC-MS grade). Quality control (QC) sample was pooled from 120 \u00b5l of each sample and later used for stability and reproducibility assessment of the machine. Pooled QC were diluted to 80%, 60%, 40%, 20%, 10%, 1% and 0% to obtain dilution QC samples. This dilution series were further used in feature extraction step to eliminate product ions with erratic behaviour. Modified from a previously described procedure[1], the standardized 96-wells plate sample preparation platform were applied in this study. Before aliquoting to the microplate, all samples were randomized in their arrangement in order to reduce technical bias. The 150 \u00b5l of samples were then transferred to 96-wells microplate and added up with 150 \u00b5l of internal standards (hippuric acid-D5 and L-phenylalanine-13C9, 15N). The mixture was shaken using Thermomixer C (Eppendorf, USA) at 4,500 rpm, 4 \u00b0C for 10 min. The 125 \u00b5l of sample mixture was aliquoted into 2 analytical plates and placed in 4 \u00b0C sample manager for further analysis in LC/MS positive and negative ionization mode. Whereas, organic phase extracted from methanol/chloroform/water (2:2:1) was resuspended with 400 \u00b5l of isopropanol/acetonitrile/water (2:1:1). The 400 \u00b5l of lipid internal standards (LPC(9:0), PC(11:0/11:0), FA(17:0), PG(15:0/15:0), PE(15:0/15:0), PS(17:0/17:0), PA(17:0/17:0), Cer(d18:1/17:0), DG(19:0/19:0), PC(23:0/23:0), TG(15:0/15:0/15:0), and TG(17:0/17:0/17:0)) were mixed with 100 \u00b5l of samples in 96-wells plate. Subsequent steps of mixing and aliquoting were carried out in accordance with above-mentioned aqueous phase method. The QC and dilution QC samples were also prepared accordingly. </p><p><br></p><p>Ref:</p><p>[1] Lewis MR, Pearce JT, Spagou K, Green M, Dona AC, Yuen AH, David M et al.

Raw files of run-order QCs, dilution QCs, and all samples were imported into the software and only M+H and M-H adducts were assigned for ion detection in positive and negative mode, respectively. Peak alignment was automatically processed using the most suitable QC as reference and manual adjustments were made where necessary in cases of peak misalignments. Peak picking was also performed by default with minimum peak width of 0.01 min. Data was normalized to internal standards that were able to be detected in acceptable peak shape and intensity. In data filtration step, whole dataset was exported and run using Microsoft Excel 2010 (Microsoft, USA). To yield the greatest extent of final dataset, a relative standard deviation (RSD) of feature intensity among all run-order QC samples and Pearson correlation of features to serial QC dilutions was applied to filter features. Taking all QC samples, the ions with RSD value of ion intensity over 30% were removed from the dataset. As well, the features having a Pearson correlation to dilution series less than 0.8 were considered as artificial features and removed.",
