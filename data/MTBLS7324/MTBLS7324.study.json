                "description": "<p>Ralstonia solanacearum, one of the most destructive crop pathogens worldwide, causes bacterial wilt disease in a wide range of host plants. The major component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, lipopolysaccharides (LPS), has been shown to function as elicitors of plant defense leading to the activation of signaling and defense pathways in several plant species. LPS from a R. solanacearum strain virulent on tomato (LPSR. sol.), were purified, chemically characterized and structurally elucidated. The lipid A moiety consisted of tetra- to hexa-acylated bis-phosphorylated disaccharide backbone, also decorated by aminoarabinose residues in minor species, while the O-polysaccharide chain consisted of either linear tetrasaccharide or branched pentasaccharide repeating units containing alpha-L-rhamnose, N-acetyl-beta-Dglucosamine and beta-L-xylose. These properties might be associated with the evasion of host surveillance, aiding the establishment of the infection. Using untargeted metabolomics, the effect of LPSR. sol. elicitation on the metabolome of Solanum lycopersicum leaves was investigated across three incubation time intervals with the application of UHPLC-MS for metabolic profiling. The results revealed the production of oxylipins, e.g., trihydroxy octadecenoic acid and trihydroxy octadecadienoic acid, as well as several hydroxycinnamic acid amide derivatives, e.g., coumaroyl tyramine and feruloyl tyramine, as phytochemicals that exhibit a positive correlation to LPSR. sol. treatment. Although the chemical properties of these metabolite classes have been studied, the functional roles of these compounds have not been fully elucidated. Overall, the results suggest that the features of the LPSR. sol. chemotype aid in limiting or attenuating the full deployment of small molecular host defenses and contribute to the understanding of the perturbation and reprogramming of host metabolism during biotic immune responses.</p>",

                        "description": "<p><strong>Plant cultivation conditions</strong></p><p>The STAR9008 (8SC) tomato cultivar seeds were obtained from a tomato breeding programme associated with resistance against <em>R. solanacearum</em> (Stark Ayres, Pty. Ltd. Bredell, South Africa, www.starkeayres.co.za). The seeds were germinated in a commercially available germination soil mixture (Culterra, Muldersdrift, South Africa). The tomato plants were grown under greenhouse conditions: a light/dark cycle of 12/12 h, with the light intensity set at 80 \u00b5mol/m^2/s and the temperature regulated between 22-24 \u00b0C. The plants were 30-35 cm in height at the time of the experiments.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Ralstonia solanacearum</em>, cell culture and extraction of LPS</strong></p><p>The strain of <em>R. solanacearum</em> used in this study was BD 261 (Coutinho collection, University of Pretoria, GenBank Accession number KY 709230) from South African origin belonging to race 2 biovar 3. Prior to cultivation, the pathogen was plated out on both the triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) media and the selective South Africa-Elphinstone (SMSA-E) media at 28 \u00b0C for 48 h<strong>[1]</strong>. The plating step was added to monitor colony purity and to prevent external contamination. This strain was used in previous studies regarding the metabo-phenotyping and metabolomics of the host response (disease tolerance) of the selected tomato cvs.<strong>[2][3]</strong> and the inducible changes of the metabolome to peptide elicitors derived from <em>R. solanacearum</em> flagellin<strong>[4]</strong> and cold shock protein<strong>[5]</strong>. LPS was purified from saturated cell cultures grown in the nutrient broth medium on an orbital shaker at 28 \u00b0C, using the hot phenol protocol as previously described<strong>[6]</strong> and incorporating DNase and protease digestion steps<strong>[7]</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Plant elicitation and experimental design for metabolomic analysis</strong></p><p>The tomato plants (selected based on uniformity in size and appearance) were watered 5 h prior to the inoculation step, to open leaf stomata and ease the process of pressure infiltration. The layout of the treatment process was as follows: 3 tomato plants were reserved for each of the LPSR. sol. treatments at the respective time intervals (16, 24 and 32 h), along with the addition of corresponding MgSO4 controls. Sampling consistency was maintained by selecting the leaves from the fourth node for LPSR. sol. or control treatment.</p><p><br></p><p>The LPS stock (1 mg/mL) was dissolved in sterile 8 mM MgSO4 to a working concentration of 100 \u03bcg/mL. The plants were treated with 100 \u03bcg/mL LPSR. sol. by pressure infiltration into the abaxial side of the leaves using a blunt-ended syringe. Again, the control group was inoculated with an 8 mM MgSO4 solution. The plants selected for each of the conditions were treated in separate locations to prevent cross-contamination. During the pressure infiltration step, the entire leaf surface was supplied with the appropriate elicitor/control solution, which minimized the level of biological variation and permitted the harvest of the entire leaf tissue. Care was taken to avoid/limit wounding or mechanical damage. After inoculation, the cultivar groups were left to incubate for 16, 24 and 32 h, respectively. Following the incubation times, the inoculated leaves for each group condition were harvested, and metabolic activity was quenched in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 \u00b0C.</p><p><br></p><p>The experimental design included 3 independent biological replicates. Sufficient plant material was thus obtained to create a total of 3 biological replicates for each of the control and elicitor treatment groups across the 3 incubation intervals. Together with 3 analytical replicates of each, this generated n = 9 as required for metabolomic analysis based on multivariate statistics<strong>[8][9]</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Pontes NC, Fujinawa MF, Oliveira JR.

Altogether 2 g of leaf powder from each of the group conditions were extracted with cold 80% methanol in a 1:10 (w/v) ratio. The samples were sonicated with both a sonicator probe (Bandelin Sonopuls, Berlin, Germany) set at 100% power for 30 s, and a sonicator bath for 30 min at 15 \u00b0C. The samples were centrifuged using a bench top swinging-bucket centrifuge set at 5525 x g and 4 \u00b0C for 30 min to pellet the cell debris. The supernatants were removed, transferred into round-bottom flasks and evaporated under vacuum to 1 mL using a B\u00fcchi rotary evaporator at 55 \u00b0C. The concentrated 1 mL solutions were carefully transferred into 2 mL microcentrifuge tubes and dried overnight in a heating block set to 55 \u00b0C. Following the overnight drying step, the evaporated samples were reconstituted in 500 \u00b5L of 50% HPLC-grade methanol:milliQ water solvent (1:1, v/v). The samples were vortexed briefly and filtered through 0.22 \u00b5m nylon syringe filters into vials fitted with 500 \u00b5L inserts. The samples were stored at 4 \u00b0C until LC-MS analysis.</p><p><br></p><p>The cold methanol extraction method described above has widely been used in metabolomics experiments but does preselect for metabolites extractable in methanol and highly polar/nonpolar compounds may only be partially extracted or be completely lost in the case of very volatile compounds.

An Acquity HSS T3 reverse-phase column (2.1 x 150 mm x 1.7 \u00b5m; Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA) was used for chromatographic separation. A binary solvent system consisting of acetonitrile (Romil Chemistry, Cambridge, UK):MilliQ water, with both solvents containing 0.1% formic acid (FA, Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany) and 2.5% isopropanol (Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany), was used. A binary gradient elution method was used over a 30 min run with a flow rate set to 400 \u00b5L/min. In total 3 pooled quality control (QC) samples composed of aliquots from all the sample groups, as well as 50% HPLC-grade methanol blanks were included in the sample list. The QC samples were added to monitor sample stability and feature legitimacy, assess intensity drifts that occur during the data acquisition process, and to monitor instrumental efficiency and robustness. Each of the biological samples (originating from 3 biological replicates) were analysed in triplicate (analytical repeats) on the UPLC-MS instrument to improve precision and accuracy. In total 2 \u03bcL of each sample was injected with the elution starting at 2% (v/v) acetonitrile from 0 to 1 min, raised to 70% acetonitrile from 1 to 22 min, taken up to 95% from 22 to 23 min then kept constant at 95% acetonitrile from 23 to 26 min.

The lockmass flow rate was 100 \u00b5L/min, with leucine encephalin as a double-point lock spray internal reference solution (50 pg/mL, [M+H]+ = 556.2771 and [M-H]- = 554.2615), continuously sampled every 15 s, producing an average intensity of 350 counts/scan in centroid mode, with typical mass accuracies between 3-5 mDa and a mass accuracy window of 0.5 Da. High purity nitrogen was used as desolvation, cone and collision gas. The MS analyses set up to perform 5 sequential full scan methods with increasing collision energies ranging from 10 to 50 eV. The method described above enables the simulation of MSE acquisition, while additionally allowing for the monitoring of individual collision energy channels. This feature greatly facilitates the downstream structural elucidation of compounds. By acquiring data at various collision energies, the method ensures the fragmentation of a diverse range of compounds with varying physicochemical properties.</p>",

                        "description": "<p>The data obtained from the UPLC-MS system were analyzed with the Masslynx software (Waters Corporation, Manchester, UK), with the addition of other statistical programs for multivariate data analysis (MVDA). Pre-treatment and pre-processing steps were according to literature<strong>[1]</strong>. Briefly, the raw data was processed with MarkerLynx XS 4.2 application manager, with the following parameters: 0.60-21 min retention time (Rt) range of the chromatograms and m/z domain of mass range 50-1500 Da. The Rts were allowed to differ by \u00b1 0.20 min and the m/z values by \u00b1 0.05 Da. The mass tolerance was 0.01 Da and the intensity threshold was 10 counts. Only the data matrices with noise level less than 50% (MarkerLynx cut off) were retained for downstream data analyses. The MarkerLynx application uses the patented ApexPeakTrack algorithm to perform accurate peak detection and alignment. Furthermore, MarkerLynx performs sample normalisation, based on total ion intensities of each defined peak. Prior to calculating intensities, Savitzky-Golay smoothing and integration was performed<strong>[1]-[3]</strong>. The generated data matrices were imported into SIMCA (soft independent modelling of class analogy) software, version 14.0 software with the \u2018Omics\u2019 skin (Sartorius Stedim Data Analytics AB, Ume\u00e5, Sweden) for statistical analyses. Prior to chemometric modelling, the independent variable i.e., features, within the data matrix were Pareto-scaled as a method of data normalisation, to accommodate and adjust for measurement errors between minor and major peaks. A nonlinear iterative partial least squares algorithm (NIPLS, in-built within SIMCA software) was applied to manage missing values, with a default threshold of 50% and a correction factor of 3.0. Two unsupervised multivariate methods, principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HiCA), were applied. PCA is an unsupervised projection-based modelling tool that permits the exploration of the dataset, conclusively revealing the systematic variation present within the variables<strong>[4]</strong>. PCA converts all the correlated variables, i.e. the metabolite feature with their respective intensities, into a smaller number of new uncorrelated variables, described as principal components (PCs) \u2013 that can be projected onto a lower dimensional space while retaining most of the information embedded in the original dataset<strong>[5]-[7]</strong>. HiCA is a general algorithmic approach used in cluster analysis, where the observations from the PCA analysis are grouped into clusters based on their varying degrees of (dis)similarity.</p><p><br></p><p>In addition, a supervised statistical method, orthogonal projection to latent structures discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) was used for discriminant analysis and identification of features contributing to differences in the metabolomes. OPLS-DA is typically applied as a supervised method of diagnosing select differences between two groups. In this experiment, the OPLS-DA modelling was used to compare the LPSR. sol.-treated samples to the MgSO4 control samples for each incubation interval, and to subsequently identify which metabolite features demonstrate the largest impact (i.e., discriminatory power), on class separation between the two analysed groups<strong>[8]</strong>. Without rigorous validation, OPLS-DA modelling might be able to produce unreliable class separation leading to statistically insignificant conclusions<strong>[9]</strong>. Several methods of validating the OPLS-DA models were consistently applied, e.g.&nbsp;the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plot construction, response permutation testing and a seven-fold cross-validation (CV) method<strong>[10]</strong>. Only models deemed statistically valid were examined and used in data mining process and marker discovery. Variable importance in projection (VIP) plots were generated to assess the calculated importance of the discriminant features the discovered during the negative control vs LPSR.sol. treatment supervised methodologies.&nbsp;The VIP plots in the study had two purposes: firstly, they acted as a guide to aid in the selection of statistically significant features with VIP scores above a universal threshold of \u2265 2; and secondly, they served as a validation method to prevent any potential bias during the feature selection process. The study found that utilising these plots helped to identify relevant features and minimised the risk of introducing bias during the selection process<strong>[1]</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1] </strong>Tugizimana F, Steenkamp PA, Piater LA, Dubery IA.
