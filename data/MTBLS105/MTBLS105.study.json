                "description": "This study evaluates changes in metabolite levels in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cases vs. patients with liver cirrhosis by analysis of human blood plasma using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Untargeted metabolomic analysis of plasma samples from participants recruited in Egypt was performed using two GC-MS platforms: a GC coupled to single quadruple mass spectrometer (GC-qMS) and a GC coupled to a time-of-flight mass spectrometer (GC-TOFMS). Analytes that showed statistically significant changes in ion intensities were selected using ANOVA models. These analytes and other candidates selected from related studies were further evaluated by targeted analysis in plasma samples from the same participants as in the untargeted metabolomic analysis. The targeted analysis was performed using the GC-qMS in selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode. The method confirmed significant changes in the levels of glutamic acid, citric acid, lactic acid, valine, isoleucine, leucine, alpha tocopherol, cholesterol, and sorbose in HCC cases vs. patients with liver cirrhosis. Specifically, our findings indicate up-regulation of metabolites involved in branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) metabolism. Although BCAAs are increasingly used as a treatment for cancer cachexia, others have shown that BCAA supplementation caused significant enhancement of tumor growth via activation of mTOR/AKT pathway, which is consistent with our results that BCAAs are up-regulated in HCC.",

Through peripheral venepuncture, single blood sample was drawn into 10 ml BD Vacutainer sterile vacuum tubes in presence of EDTA anticoagulant. The blood was immediately centrifuged at 1000 x g for 10 min at room temperature. The plasma supernatant was carefully collected and centrifuged at 2500 x g for 10 min at room temperature. After aliquoting, plasma was kept frozen at -80 \u00b0C until use. Primary tubes and plasma aliquots were labeled using anonymous confidential code numbers with no personal identifiers. Identification codes were cross-referenced with clinical information in a pass code protected computer system.",

                        "description": "\nUntargeted GC-MS:</br>\nThe GC-TOFMS data were analyzed using the LECO ChromaTOF software. The GC-qMS data were processed by the Automated Mass Spectral Deconvolution and Identification System (AMDIS) [1] for peak detection, deconvolution, and metabolite identification. The results were then imported into Mass Profiler Professional (MPP) for alignment and statistical analysis. In addition, both the GC-TOFMS and GC-qMS data were analyzed by MetaboliteDetector [2], which allows the utilization of RI values for alignment using the RI values calculated for every detected analyte based on RI calibration that were performed for each batch separately. The calculated RI values were also used for narrowing the library search results, thereby reducing the number of false putative identifications. Also, MetaboliteDetector enables us to select the top three fragments based on the quality of their EICs. Putative metabolite identifications were determined based on spectral matching using the Fiehn and NIST libraries. The Fiehn library includes spectra only from TMS compounds. To reduce the false discovery rate in the metabolite identification process using the NIST library, we extracted all compounds acquired by TMS derivatization (around 5,000 compounds with more than 22,000 spectra).\n</p>\nPrior to statistical analysis, raw intensities were log-transformed to make the component intensity distributions more comparable with a normal probability density function. Based on the number of measurements available for each feature across the runs, we used three different steps to evaluate the statistical significance comparing cases and controls. If a peak is found in most of the runs from one group and is missing completely in the other group, it is considered as a potential candidate without any further statistical hypothesis testing. If a peak is present in both groups, but missing in many runs, a logistic regression model is used to find the difference between cases and controls and significance is estimated based on the calculated p-values. The remaining peaks were analyzed by using a two-way ANOVA model. To control the false discovery rate (FDR), we calculated q-values using the Benjamini-Hochberg method. Analytes were selected based on two criteria (consistent mean fold change direction in all batches and q<0.1), i.e., analytes with significant group effect but insignificant batch-group interaction were selected. The mean fold change was calculated for each batch separately based on the cases and controls within the batch. Also the batch-group interaction term was included to avoid overestimation of the error variance as it can increase the number of false negatives.\n</p>\nTargeted GC-SIM-MS:</br>\nWe used MetaboliteDetector to find the retention time (RT) values for a subset of the targets with relatively high similarity scores. These RT values were compared against those in the Fiehn library to estimate the difference between expected and observed elution times. Following that, we used an in-house tool to extract the EIC guided by the estimated RT from the previous step. The algorithm uses an RT window centered at the expected elution time of the analyte of interest and searches the neighborhood area for all detected peaks at monitored masses. The quantifier fragment is used to perform the search and all qualifiers peaks are found based on the location of the quantifier peak. Following smoothing of the EICs and baseline correction, the peak width and the area under the curve (AUC) of the EICs are calculated. Finally, a similarity score is calculated based on the expected SIM spectra from the library to verify the identification. Since only four fragments were monitored per analyte in the SIM mode, we used a more restrictive approach to calculate the spectral matching similarity score [3]. Specifically, a mixed measure is used based on two scores: (i) weighted dot product; (ii) average pairwise ratios between fragments. Also, we checked each EIC by visual inspection to avoid identification errors.\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Stein SE.
