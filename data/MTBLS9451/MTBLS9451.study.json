                "description": "The imbalance of intestinal flora can affect the immune function and structural integrity of the intestinal barrier, leading to the colonization and reproduction of opportunistic pathogenic bacteria in the intestine to become the dominant flora, eventually inducing enteritis. This study aimed to investigate whether fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) could improve the gut barrier in Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). The experiment involved administering normal saline (NS group) and fecal microbiota (FMT group) (from the negative control group (C group)) to tilapia that had been treated with oxytetracycline hydrochloride (OTC) (M group) by gavage. A total of 300 male tilapia (mean body weight 596.65 \u00b1 47.18 g) were used, with 180 of them being fed OTC (120 mg/kg body weight/day) for 7 days to induce intestinal oxidative stress, while the rest served as the control group. After confirmation of mild chronic enteritis, the tilapia were treated in different ways.",

The fish were acclimated in black plastic tanks (500 L) for 2 weeks. The daily water exchange rate was 100% of the tank volume. The water quality parameters were maintained at 6.48 \u00b1 0.47 mg/L dissolved oxygen, 28 \u00b1 2 \u00b0C temperature and 7.83 \u00b1 0.22 pH. The natural photoperiod was used, and the water quality indicators were checked daily to maintain them within the safety range. All procedures of this study were conducted on fish and animal care was performed strictly followed the Management Rule of Laboratory Animals (Chinese Order No. 676 of the State Council, revised 1 March 2017). All animal experiments were carried out in accordance with the guidelines of China Animal Welfare Legislation.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Preparation of fecal microbiota suspension</strong></p><p>The tilapia in the control group were obtained intestinal contents for fecal microbiota suspension. All these fish were starved for 24 h before collection. The hind intestines were isolated from donor fish and placed into 40 mL sterile sampling cups on ice in a biosafety cabinet. The intestine was opened longitudinally with a scalpel to scrape out its contents. Intestine contents were placed into 40 mL sterile sampling cups and homogenized in sterile normal saline (0.9%) at a ratio of 1 g to 4 mL. The suspension was passed through a 100 \u03bcm cell strainer to remove undigested food and particulate matter. Finally, the fecal suspension was separated into 10 mL sterile tubes and stored at -4 \u00b0C. The preparation time from fecal microbiota suspension collection to gavage was less than 4 h.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Diet preparation and feeding trial</strong></p><p>Oxytetracycline hydrochloride (OTC, CAS: 2058-46-0, \u2265 98%) was purchased from Anda Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd (Hubei, China). After acclimation for 7 days, we supplemented the diet of male tilapia with a broad-spectrum antibiotic regimen of OTC (120 mg/kg body weight/day) for 1 week. The immediate impact of antibiotic treatment on gut microbiome configuration was assessed in 12 random tilapia sacrificed after a week antibiotic diet. The remaining animals (14 fish each tank, 4 replicates per group) were divided into 3 post-antibiotic intervention groups. In the first group (FMT), antibiotic treatment was followed by FMT treatment 3x times through gastric gavage of fecal microbiota suspension from the control group. Each tilapia in the second group (NS) received normal saline same as the FMT group. A third group (M) remained untreated following antibiotic therapy to assess the spontaneous recovery of the indigenous gut microbiome in this setting. An additional group of tilapia (C) did not receive antibiotics or any other treatment for the control, and their hind intestinal contents were collected for FMT treat.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Sample and dissection</strong></p><p>After antibiotic treatment, 12 tilapia from each treatment group were randomly collected to collect the blood, hindgut contents and distal intestine (from the anus to the first twist of the intestine). The intestine tissue was stored at 80 \u00b0C for biochemical analysis, gene and protein expression analysis. Intestinal contents were collected for 16S rRNA sequencing. The same sample was collected on day 29 and day 43. The intestinal contents at day 43 were collected for metabolomic analysis. LC-MS/MS analysis was conducted by PANOMIX Biomedical Tech Co. (Suzhou, China).</p>",

Multivariate analysis using a partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) approach was performed with the R package ropls. VIP &gt; 1 and P &lt; 0.05 were chosen as screening criteria to screen the differential metabolites between the M and FMT groups. The screened peaks were corrected, and the metabolites identification information was obtained by searching the laboratory biodeep self-built database and integrating the public database including the Metlin and MetDNA methods. Then, metabolites procured after identifying all the measured molecular weights were classified according to KEGG and Metabolon. In addition, hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) was performed with the pheatmap-package in R software (v3.3.2) to visualize the metabolite profiles and reveal the relationship between metabolites and samples. MetPA is used to analyze metabolic pathways in metabolomics data. Furthermore, KEGG pathways of differential metabolites were analyzed using MetPA software and metabolic pathway correlation networks were mapped.</p>",
