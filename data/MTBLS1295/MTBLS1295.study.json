                "description": "<p>The co-occurrence of gut microbiota dysbiosis and bile acids (BAs) metabolism alteration has been reported in several human liver diseases. However, the gut microbiota dysbiosis in infantile cholestatic jaundice (CJ), and the linkage between gut bacterial changes and alterations of BAs metabolism are undetermined. To address this question, we performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing to determine the compositional and functional differences in gut microbiota, and access their association with fecal levels of primary and secondary BAs in infants with CJ. Our data revealed that CJ infants showed marked declines in fecal levels of primary BAs and most secondary BAs. A decreased ratio of cholic acid (CA):chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) in CJ indicated a shift in BA synthesis from the primary to the alternative BA pathway. The CJ-enriched bacterial taxa corresponds to genera Clostridium, Gemella, Streptococcus, Veillonella, and family Enterobacteriaceae were negatively correlated with fecal BAs level and the CDCA:CA ratio, but positively correlated with the serological indexes of liver functions. An increased ratio of deoxycholic acid (DCA):CA was observed in a proportion of CJ. The CJ-depleted bacteria, including Bifidobacterium and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, were positively and negatively correlated with fecal levels of BAs and the serological markers of impaired liver function, respectively. In conclusion, the reduced concentration of BAs in the gut of CJ is correlated with gut microbiota dysbiosis. The altered gut microbiota of CJ is likely to upregulate the conversion from primary to secondary BAs.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Linked cross omic data sets:</strong></p><p>Raw sequencing data associated with this study are available in the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA): accession number <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/PRJEB33641' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>PRJEB33641</a>.</p>",

The diagnosis of CJ in infants was based on the guidelines described in Moyer et al. (2004) [1] and Fawaz et al. (2017) [2]. An abnormal direct bilirubin (DB) is defined as a value greater than 17 \u03bcmol/l if the total bilirubin (TB) is less than 85 \u03bcmol/l, or a value of DB that represents more than 20% of the TB if the TB is greater than 85 \u03bcmol/l [1]. Serological test for liver function was performed, and indexes including BA, DB, TB, Gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and albumin (ALB) of patients were measured by using AU5800 clinical chemistry analyzer (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, United States). Hemoglobin (HB) was measured by SLS hemoglobin test from Sysmex XN-1000 automatic hematology analyzer (Sysmex Corporation). Twenty-five infants with normal levels of DB, TB, but with elevated AST and ALT levels were enrolled in the study as control, termed as impaired hepatic function (IHF) group. Forty-five healthy infants without any history of chronic diseases were enrolled as healthy control (HC). None of the healthy individuals had clinically relevant CJ or any symptoms at the time of fecal collection, and subjects who took antibiotics within two months before fecal collection, or in any inflammatory conditions were excluded from the study. Written informed consent was obtained from parents or legal guardians of infants eligible for the study enrollment. This study was approved by the Regional Ethical Review Boards of Shanghai Children\u2019s Hospital and carried out accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki of 1964 and later versions.</p><p><br></p><p>Stool samples were collected with sterile swabs by nursing staff at Shanghai Children\u2019s Hospital, and stored at -80\u2103. Targeted metabolomics profiling was performed to measure concentrations of 43 BAs.</p><p><br></p><p>Ref:</p><p>[1] Moyer V, Freese DK, Whitington PF, Olson AD, Brewer F, Colletti RB, Heyman MB.
