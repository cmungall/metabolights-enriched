                "description": "In the European Union, the use of thyreostats for animal fattening purposes has been banned because of their carcinogenic and teratogenic effects, whereby any residues in derived food products may hold a risk for human health. In this regard, potential abuse is monitored by targeted analysis of thyreostats with the application of a zero-tolerance policy. However, such a strategy is no longer adequate because of the semi-endogenous origin of some thyreostats, including thiouracil (TU). Additionally, the use of recommended TU concentration levels (10 or 30 \u00b5g/l) is also not fully conclusive. Therefore, this study aimed at defining urinary metabolite markers by which the true origin of detected TU could be ascertained. To this end, an in vivo study was carried out in which 11 calves were subjected to either a control treatment, a rapeseed-enriched diet (known to induce semi-endogenous formation) or a TU treatment. Urine samples (n = 165) were assessed through metabolic fingerprinting, employing ultra-high performance liquid-chromatography and Q-Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometry. Urinary fingerprints were interpreted by multivariate data-analysis. </br></br> The targeted Calf samples assay for this study can be found in the MetaboLights study MTBLS554.</br> <br/>Linked Studies: <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS554' target='_blank'><span class='label label-success'>MTBLS554</span></a>",

Within a first treatment group, test animals received a diet that was enriched with rapeseed cake, which intended to promote the semi-endogenous formation of TU. A second group of animals were fed a commercial diet during the entire course of the trial and thus served as control group. Finally, a group of animals was treated with TU on a daily basis (in the morning) for one week, which was followed by a washout period. Acclimation periods were incorporated for adaptation to the imposed dietary regimen.\n</p>\nEach of the treatments was preceded by a 2-week acclimation phase during which all test animals were fed a commercial diet of concentrate (27% crude protein content) with ad libitum access to water and hay. Whereas this dietary regimen was maintained for the control and TU treated group, one fraction of the test animals received a diet in which 30% of the concentrate was replaced by rapeseed cake (37% crude protein content). With respect to the TU treated group, animals were orally administered a daily dose of 0.2 g TU per 100 kg body weight (TU analytical powder, Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) by means of a filled capsule. Following this TU treatment, a short washout period was appended to assess the excretion profiles of potential markers in urine.\n</p>\nTest animals were housed under controlled experimental conditions at the animal facilities of Centre d\u2019Economie Rurale (CER, Marloie, Belgium), whereby animals were kept in separate half-covered pens. It was hereby opted to include both cows and calves since an age-dependent metabolic response towards TU treatment could be expected. All calves (female, 101.6 \u00b1 14.7 kg, 3.3 \u00b1 0.3 months) were of a mixed breed, whereas cows (female, 587.1 \u00b1 98.9 kg, 4.0 \u00b1 1.5 years) were either of a milk or meat breed. This in vivo study was approved by CER\u2019s Ethical Committee (CE/Sant\u00e9/ET004).\n</p>\nUrine was collected in 5-ml aliquots, whereby samples were treated with EDTA (final concentration of 0.1 M) and 0.1 M hydrogen chloride (final pH 1) to inhibit thyreostat degradation during urine storage. Urine samples were stored at -20 \u00b0C and thawed prior to extraction.",

In brief, 3 ml of urine was enriched with 50 ng PTU-d5 internal standard and supplemented with 1 mL phosphate buffer, containing 1% of the reducing agent DDT. Hereby, denaturing conditions (65 \u00b0C, 30 min) were imposed to impede protein-thyreostat interactions and avoid protein-based interference. Next, a 2-fold liquid-liquid extraction with 5 ml ethyl acetate was performed, after which the pooled supernatants were evaporated to dryness at 60 \u00b0C under a gentle stream of nitrogen. The remaining residue was dissolved in 200 \u00b5l ultrapure water (0.1% formic acid) and methanol (0.1% formic acid) (90/10, v/v). The injection volume was 10 \u00b5l.\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Vanden Bussche J, Vanhaecke L, Deceuninck Y, Verheyden K, Wille K, Bekaert K, Le Bizec B, De Brabander HF.

To this end, urine samples from both treatment groups were extracted and analyzed in a random order, keeping the batches of the cows and calves separately. During the discovery phase, data was interpreted in a truly untargeted fashion. Following this, the classification performance of the selected candidate markers was further evaluated by considering the samples from the rapeseed-enriched diet and washout group. These samples were analyzed in a random order, whereby a targeted processing (XCalibur 3.0 software) of the acquired full-scan data was performed. During mass spectrometric analysis of urine extracts, quality control measures were taken by considering external and internal quality control (QC) samples. QC samples were prepared starting from pooled urine (equal volume contributions from at least 60 samples), which was extracted according to the standard protocol. External QC samples were used for instrument stabilization, whereas internal QC samples were included to monitor and correct for instrumental drift.\n</p>\nAcquired full-scan MS data of study samples were imported into the SieveTM 2.2 software package (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, USA) to compose metabolic fingerprints. Metabolite features from total ion current chromatograms were extracted, applying peak alignment and integration. As primary parameters, a frame m/z width of 6 ppm, a frame time width of 0.75 min, and an intensity threshold of 1,000,000 were set. Each of the detected features was characterized through its retention time (tR) and m/z-value.\n</p>\nFor the discovery phase, the normalized multivariate data matrices from the TU treated and control group were analyzed by SIMCA 14.1 (Umetrics, Malm\u00f6, Sweden), whereby it was aimed to discover metabolome discrepancies for the two study groups. Data were log-transformed and pareto-scaled to induce normality and standardize the peak intensity ranges, respectively. In first instance, unsupervised segregation was checked by principal component analysis (PCA), allowing to evaluate clustering of QC samples and identify potential outliers. Subsequently, orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) was performed to model variation and establish separation between investigated treatment groups.",
