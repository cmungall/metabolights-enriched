                "description": "Studies of food microorganism domestication can provide important insight into adaptation mechanisms and lead to commercial applications. Penicillium roqueforti is a fungus with four genetically differentiated populations, two of which were independently domesticated for blue cheese-making, with the other two populations thriving in other environments. Most blue cheeses are made with strains from a single P. roqueforti population, whereas Roquefort cheeses are inoculated with strains from a second population. We made blue cheeses in accordance with the production specifications for Roquefort-type cheeses, inoculating each cheese with a single P. roqueforti strain, using a total of three strains from each of the four populations. We investigated differences between the cheeses made with the strains from the four P. roqueforti populations, in terms of the induced flora, the proportion of blue color, water activity and the identity and abundance of aqueous and organic metabolites as proxies for proteolysis and lipolysis as well as volatile compounds responsible for flavor and aroma. We found that the population-of-origin of the P. roqueforti strains used for inoculation had a minor impact on bacterial diversity and no effect on the abundance of the main microorganism. The cheeses produced with P. roqueforti strains from cheese populations had a higher percentage of blue area and a higher abundance of the volatile compounds typical of blue cheeses, such as methyl ketones and secondary alcohols. In particular, the Roquefort strains produced higher amounts of these aromatic compounds, partly due to more efficient proteolysis and lipolysis. The Roquefort strains also led to cheeses with a lower water availability, an important feature for preventing spoilage in blue cheeses, which is subject to controls for the sale of Roquefort cheese. The typical appearance and flavors of blue cheeses thus result from human selection on P. roqueforti, leading to the acquisition of specific features by the two cheese populations. These findings have important implications for our understanding of adaptation and domestication, and for cheese improvement.",

For this goal, 90-day cheeses were analysed following 2 procedures of extraction (water or organic solvents) and UHPLC-MS analysis. All the samples, including extracts of curds before moulding and cheeses at 20 and 180 days of ripening, have also been deposited.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Water-soluble compounds:</strong></p><p>Using UHPLC-MS analysis on water extracts of the cheeses, the <em>P. roqueforti</em> population was analysed to see whether it influenced the quantities of water-soluble compounds. Water-soluble metabolites were extracted using the method previously described<strong>[1]</strong>. Briefly, 90-day cheeses were frozen at -80 \u00b0C until extraction. Cheese samples of 10 g were 5-fold (w/w) diluted in deionized water (Milli-Q Reagent Grade Water System, Millipore Corporation, Billerica, Massachusetts, USA). The mixture was then blended for 1 min and the homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 10 min. The supernatant was further centrifuged on centrifugal filter units, with 10 kDa cutoff (Vivaspin 20, Sartorius, Palaiseau, France) at 8000 x g for 30 min. The filtrate was stored at -80 \u00b0C until analysis. After thawing, the samples were filtered again (0.22 \u03bcm) and diluted in 0.1% Formic acid when required for analyses by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS; UHPLC Ultimate 3000 and HR-MS-Q exactive, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Les Ulis, France).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Organic compounds:</strong></p><p>In order to analyze whether the P. roqueforti population influenced the quantities of free fatty acids and residual glycerides in 90-day cheeses, a new extraction procedure was developed. A global extraction (accelerated solvent extraction with Hexane-Isobutanol) was coupled with a UHPLC-MS analysis in positive (triglycerides) and negative (fatty acids) ionization modes. All the steps were optimized using standards of fatty acids and triglycerides, even though the commercial triglycerides used are not found naturally in milk.</p><p><br></p><p>For the accelerated solvent extraction (ASE 350, Dionex, USA), 0.5 g of each cheese were precisely weighed and mixed with 1 g of diatomaceous earth as dispersant and desiccant to improve extraction performance. The mix was introduced into a stainless steel cell (5 ml) to which was added 200 \u03bcl of heneicosanoic acid (C21:0 25 mg/ml in Hexane/isopropanol 3:2 v/v; Fluka Sigma-Aldrich) as extraction standard. 3 extraction cycles using Isopropanol:Hexane (2:3 v/v) were performed. 3 static cycles of 15 min were applied. The extraction solvent was pumped through the extraction cell fitted with a cellulose filter and a stainless steel frit. Each stainless steel cell was maintained at a pressure of 100 bar and a temperature of 110 \u00b0C throughout the extraction. All resulting extracts of a sample were automatically combined in the same vial (15 ml) and stored at -20 \u00b0C until analysis. After thawing, the sample were filtered again (0.22 \u03bcm) and eventually diluted when required in Isopropanol:Hexane (2:3 v/v) by UHPLC-MS (UHPLC Ultimate 3000 and HR-MS-Q exactive, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Les Ulis, France).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Volatile compounds:</strong></p><p>The identity and abundance of volatile compounds involved in flavor and aromas was investigated. The volatile compound extraction was performed using a dynamic headspace (DHS) system with a Gerstel MPS autosampler (M\u00fclheim an der Ruhr, Germany). The sorbent material used was Tenax TA (2,6-diphenylene oxide polymer, Gerstel) conditioned before use as recommended by the manufacturer.</p><p><br></p><p>3 g of cheese sample, previously crushed and stored at -80 \u00b0C, were weighed precisely into a 20 ml glass vial without thawing. The samples were then stored at 4 \u00b0C for 16 hr before analysis in order to stabilize the interactions between matrix and volatile compounds. The samples were then transferred to the sampling support (10 \u00b0C) and analysed randomly.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Le Boucher C, Courant F, Jeanson S, Chereau S, Maillard MB, Royer AL, Thierry A, Dervilly-Pinel G, Le Bizec B, Lortal S.
