                "description": "<p>The pregnancy vaginal microbiome contributes to risk of preterm birth, the primary cause of death in children under 5 years of age. Here we describe direct on-swab metabolic profiling by Desorption Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry (DESI-MS) for sample preparation-free characterisation of the cervicovaginal metabolome in two independent pregnancy cohorts (VMET, n\u2009=\u2009160; 455 swabs; VMET II, n\u2009=\u2009205; 573 swabs). By integrating metataxonomics and immune profiling data from matched samples, we show that specific metabolome signatures can be used to robustly predict simultaneously both the composition of the vaginal microbiome and host inflammatory status. In these patients, vaginal microbiota instability and innate immune activation, as predicted using DESI-MS, associated with preterm birth, including in women receiving cervical cerclage for preterm birth prevention. These findings highlight direct on-swab metabolic profiling by DESI-MS as an innovative approach for preterm birth risk stratification through rapid assessment of vaginal microbiota-host dynamics.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Linked cross omic data sets:</strong></p><p>Meta-taxonomics data associated with this study are available in the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA): accession number <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJEB11895' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>PRJEB11895</a>, <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJEB12577' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>PRJEB12577</a> and <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJEB41427' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>PRJEB41427</a>.</p>",

Eligibility criteria were pregnant women with a singleton pregnancy, with and without risk factors for preterm birth. Exclusion criteria included women under 18 years of age, sexual intercourse within 72 h of sampling, vaginal bleeding in the preceding week, antibiotic use in the preceding 2 weeks, multiple pregnancies, HIV or Hepatitis C positive status. Detailed maternal clinical metadata was collected for all participants and birth outcome recorded following delivery. Preterm birth was defined as labour prior to 37 weeks of gestation. Cervicovaginal fluid swab samples were collected at up to five timepoints throughout pregnancy (1. 8-16, 2. 16-20, 3. 20-26, 4. 26-30, 5. 30-37 weeks) from the posterior fornix using BBL CultureSwab MaxV Liquid Amies swabs (Becton, Dickinson and Company, Oxford, UK), placed in either Amies transport media or a sterile microcentrifuge tube on ice, before long term storage at -80 \u00b0C.</p><p><br></p><p>Bacterial isolates analysed in this study were derived from the DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganism and Cell Culture GmbH (DSM number, <strong>Methods Table 1</strong> in the paper associated with this study) or clinical samples received by the Imperial College NHS Healthcare Trust Diagnostic Microbiology laboratory (NHS number, <strong>Methods Table 1</strong> in the paper associated with this study) at Charing Cross Hospital, London, after the completion of standard identification workflows. Identification of isolates from clinical samples was performed using a MALDI Biotyper instrument (Bruker, UK)<strong>[1]</strong>. Isolates were stored on beads and in glycerol broth at -80 \u00b0C.

The DESI sprayer tip was pointed to the swab centre with a tip\u2212sample distance of 1.5\u22122 mm and a distance between the tip and the inlet capillary of 2 mm. The entire surface of the medical swabs was analysed by DESI-MS through clockwise rotation of the swab toward the MS capillary.

MS was performed on a Waters Xevo G2-S QTOF mass spectrometer (Waters Ltd., Elstree, UK) operating in either negative-ion (ESI-) or positive-ion (ESI+) electrospray ionization mode with a capillary voltage of 1 kV for RP and 1.5 kV for HILIC, and a sampling cone voltage of 20 V. The desolvation gas flow was set to 1000 L/h and the desolvation temperature was set to 600 \u00b0C. The cone gas flow was 150 L/h, and the source temperature was 120 \u00b0C. Accurate mass was maintained by introduction of LockSpray interface of Leucine Enkephalin (<em>m/z</em> 556.2771 in ESI+, <em>m/z</em> 554.2615 in ESI-) at a concentration of 200 pg/\u03bcL in 50% aqueous acetonitrile with a scan time of 0.07 s over 4 scans, after each interval of 60 s. Data were collected in centroid mode from 50 to 1200 <em>m/z</em> in MS scanning mode. To ensure system suitability and stability, a study reference (SR) quality control (QC) sample was prepared by combining equal aliquots of all the samples and injected at regular intervals throughout the analytical run. This SR sample was also used to condition the column (30 injections) prior to the analysis of both the ESI+ and ESI- mode batches. Blank samples (i.e. injection of the reconstitution solvent) were also run to check the presence of artefact or contaminant peaks. A dilution series of the SR sample was also acquired at the beginning and end of injection sequence. Data-dependent acquisition (DDA) and MSE analysis of the SR sample were performed for structural elucidation.&nbsp;</p>",

The detailed parameter settings and algorithm used in the R package <strong>MALDIquant[1] </strong>are as follow: Peak detection was performed using 'detectPeaks', with SNR set to 3 and half window size to 10, and the using median absolute deviation (MAD) method. Peaks were aligned with a half window size set to 20, tolerance set to 0.002, signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) set to 2 using the warping method LOWESS. The reference peaks were created by calling the function 'referencePeaks' from <strong>MALDIquant </strong>with method 'strict', 'minFrequency' set to 0.01 and peak binning tolerance 0.002.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>LC-MS mass spectral data processing</strong></p><p>.mzML files were processed in R(v4.0.3) using the <strong>XCMS </strong>(v3.10.2) package<strong>[2]</strong>. Peaks were detected with the centWave algorithm (ppm=25, mzdiff=0.001, prefilter=c(4, 1000), noise=100, snthresh=5), and grouped with the \u2018density\u2019 method (bw=3, mzwid=0.0007, minFrac=0.4). The centWave peakwidth parameter was set depending on the chromatographic method (c(1.5, 14) for HILIC-LC-MS (-) c(3, 12) in RP-LC-MS Lipid (+/-) and c(1.5, 5) in the RP-LC-MS Metabolite (+/-). Non-detected peaks were filled with 'fillPeaks', using the default arguments, and no retention time correction was done. The <strong>XCMS </strong>datasets were further filtered and the feature intensities drift corrected in Python (v3.8.5) using the <strong>nPYc-Toolbox</strong> (v1.2.4)<strong>[3]</strong>. Drift correction was performed using LOWESS trend-line model fitted on the SR samples. Features where the coefficient of variation measured on repeated injections of the SR sample was larger than 30% or whose Pearson correlation with dilution was less than 0.7 (measured using the SR dilution series) were excluded from the data matrix.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>DESI-MS mass spectral data analysis of bacterial</strong> <strong>culture</strong></p><p>Spectra were processed and assembled into a single data matrix. For each isolate, the intensities per <em>m/z </em>feature of biological replicates were compared against their corresponding culture media background samples using the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test. The list of significant features was matched to the set of identified features from the analysis of human cervicovaginal swab samples. The mean fold change for matched peaks (tolerance &lt;5 ppm) was estimated as the ratio of the mean intensity within bacterial biomass samples to the mean intensity in the background culture media samples. The heatmap in <strong>Fig S6</strong> in the paper associated with this study was generated in Python (v3.8.5), with the \u2018<strong>matptlotlib</strong>\u2019 (v3.3.2) and \u2018<strong>seaborn</strong>\u2019 (v0.11.0) libraries.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Statistical analysis of metabolomic profiling data</strong></p><p>The linear mixed-effects modelling analyses were performed in R using the<strong> </strong>\u2018<strong>lme4</strong>\u2019<strong>[4]</strong> package. For all metabolic profile variables in each data matrix, a linear mixed-effects model with the following \u2018lme4\u2019 formula was fitted: Metabolite ~ GestationalAge + CST + MaternalAge + BMI + Ethnicity + (0 +&nbsp;GestationalAge|SubjectID) + (1|SubjectID). This model structure accounts for the repeated measures by using a random intercept per pregnancy and a random slope per pregnancy. No random effect term was used to model correlation between the random slopes and random intercepts. Gestational age, CST, Age, BMI and Ethnicity were modelled as fixed effects. All models were fitted using restricted maximum likelihood (\u2018REML=TRUE\u2019 in lmer function call). The \u2018<strong>emmeans</strong>\u2019<strong>[5]</strong> package (v1.5.2.1) was used to perform contrast coding and obtain effect size estimates and p-values for contrasts and trends of interest. For the comparisons between different CST\u2019s and LDOM vs LDEPL, the mean levels and contrasts obtained from the model were estimated assuming maternal age = 30 years, BMI = 23 and gestational age = 20 weeks, and averaged over all levels of ethnicity. For the gestational age trend estimates were further averaged across all CSTs. Detailed tables with effect size estimates and p-values for these analyses and contrasts are available via a GitHub repository (see code availability). The comparisons between Lactobacillus dominant vs depleted was encoded as a comparison between the grand mean of CST I, II III, V and VII levels versus the mean of CST IV. The p-values for each contrast tested were calculated using the Kenward-Roger approximation, implemented in the \u2018<strong>pbkrtest</strong>\u2019 package (v0.4.8.6)<strong>[6]</strong>. The p-values for all contrasts within a single metabolic signal were not corrected for multiple testing. Instead, for each of the main contrasts of interest (early gestation vs late gestation, CST I vs III, CST I vs IV, CST III vs IV and LDOM vs LDEPL), all p-values obtained across all metabolic variables in an assay were pooled and FDR corrected together as a signature, using Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate correction and selecting a 5% FDR cut-off. The heatmaps in <strong>Figure 1 B</strong> in the paper associated with this study were created in Python (v3.8.5),<strong> </strong>\u2018<strong>matptlotlib</strong>\u2019<strong> </strong>(v3.3.2) and <strong>\u2018seaborn</strong>\u2019<strong> </strong>(v0.11.0). Only features which were statistically significant after false discovery rate correction and replicated in both VMET and VMET2 datasets were plotted. To account for differences in <em>m/z</em> calibration between datasets, a feature was only considered to be replicated between datasets if it was possible to find&nbsp;a marker with an m/z error of less than 5 part-per-million in the final FDR corrected signature from the other study.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For the immune-metabolite association analysis, a series of linear models with the formula lm(log(ImmuneMarker+1) ~ Metabolite) were fitted in R (v4.0.3) for all immune-marker cytokine pair combinations, and the corresponding F-test p-values calculated. Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate correction was used independently for each immune marker analysis, with a 5% FDR cut-off. The heatmaps in<strong> Figure 2 A</strong> and <strong>B </strong>in the paper associated with this study were generated using Python (v3.8.5),<strong> </strong>\u2018<strong>matptlotlib</strong>\u2019 (v3.3.2) and \u2018<strong>seaborn</strong>\u2019 (v0.11.0), using the results of the linear model analysis and the random forest regression models (detailed in the next section).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Prediction of CST and immune markers from the metabolomic data</strong></p><p>The CST type was predicted from the metabolomic profiles using random forest classifiers. For the <em>Lactobacillus </em>dominant versus depleted comparison, samples which were assigned to CST I, II, III, V or VII were assigned to the <em>Lactobacillus </em>dominant class, and samples with CST IV or VI label were assigned to <em>Lactobacillus </em>depleted. Random forest classifiers were trained to predict the CST or <em>Lactobacillus </em>depletion status using the metabolic profile variables, without using any other clinical or demographical variables.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For the immune marker prediction, immune marker concentrations were initially log-transformed after addition of a constant offset log(x + 1). A random forest regressor was trained to predict a single log-transformed immune marker level. All random forest models were trained in R (v4.0.3), using the \u2018<strong>randomForest</strong>\u2019 (v4.6-14)<strong>[7]</strong> package in combination with the \u2018<strong>caret</strong>\u2019 package (v6.0-86)<strong>[8]</strong>, for model fitting, performance metric calculation and cross-validation. RF classifiers were trained using constant default parameters: number of trees \u2018ntree\u2019 = 1000, and the number of variables \u2018mtry = number of metabolic variables/3\u2019. For the random forest regression models, \u2018mtry= sqrt(number of metabolic variables)\u2019. A repeated (n=15) stratified 5-fold cross validation procedure was used for all models. This approach ensures that the train and test sets contain a similar proportion of samples from each class.</p><p>The performance of the RF models was assessed by calculating the R2 using only data left out from each CV round test sets (performed by default by '<strong>caret</strong>'). For the classifiers, ROC curves, precision-recall curves, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive-predictive value and negative predictive values were calculated and plotted with the R packages \u2018<strong>caret</strong>\u2019, \u2018<strong>pROC</strong>\u2019 (v1.16.2)<strong>[9]</strong>, \u2018<strong>plotROC</strong>\u2019 (v2.2.1)<strong>[10]</strong>, \u2018<strong>precrec</strong>\u2019 (v0.11.2)<strong>[11] </strong>and \u2018<strong>ggplot2</strong>\u2019 (v3.3.2)<strong>[12]</strong>. For the regression analysis, the R-squared was calculated with \u2018<strong>caret</strong>\u2019 and predictions plotted with \u2018<strong>ggplot2</strong>\u2019.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Metabolite identification</strong></p><p>Target m/z features were putatively annotated using online databases including HMDB, Metlin, MMCD, KEGG, and Lipidmaps with a 5 ppm tolerance for each compound. To account for potential imprecision in m/z measurement due to peak binning and data processing artefacts, raw m/z value were confirmed by inspection of the .raw data. Metabolite annotation was performed by searching the measured m/z ratios against METLIN (<a href='http://metlin.scripps.edu' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>http://metlin.scripps.edu</a>), Lipidmaps (<a href='http:// www.lipidmaps.org' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>http:// www.lipidmaps.org</a>), and the HMDB (<a href='http://www.hmdb.ca' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>http://www.hmdb.ca</a>)<strong>[13]-[15]</strong>. Further structural elucidation was performed using MS/MS experiments via collision-induced dissociation on the LTQ-Discovery MS instrument (Thermo Scientific), and with data-dependent analysis (DDA) of the precursor ion by the quadrupole of the Xevo G2 XS Q-TOF mass spectrometer (Waters corporation). For the annotation of metabolites, the MS/MS spectra were matched against spectral libraries from HMDB, NIST and METLIN that were compiled with either authentic standards or theoretical assignment. Identification of metabolites where MS/MS reference spectra were not available were annotated using chemical fragmentation rules. For the structural assignment of glycerophospholipid, fragments of the polar head group or the fatty acyl chains were investigated to confirm the annotation proposed by the databases and discriminate isomers. MSI levels of compound identification were further reported as suggested by the Metabolomics Standards Initiative (MSI)<strong>[16]</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Gibb S, Strimmer K.
