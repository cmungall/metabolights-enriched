                "description": "<p>Zhuyu pill (ZYP) is a traditional Chinese medicine prescription composed of two drugs, <em>Coptis chinensis</em> Franch. and <em>Tetradium ruticarpum</em> (A. Jussieu) T. G. Hartley, and is commonly used in the clinical treatment of diseases of the digestive system. However, the mechanism underlying the effect of ZYP on colitis remains unclear. In this study, a colitis rat model was induced with 2,4,6-trinitro-benzenesulfonic acid (TNBS, 100 mg/kg) and treated with ZYP (low dose: 0.6 g/kg, high dose: 1.2 g/kg). Disease activity index, colonic weight index and weight change ratio were used to evaluate the model and efficacy. LC-MS and 16S rRNA gene sequencing were used to measure differences in fecal metabolism and microorganism population among the control, model, low-dose ZYP and high-dose ZYP groups. To elucidate the mechanism of interventional effect of ZYP, Spearman correlation analysis was used to analyze the correlation between fecal metabolism and fecal microbial number. High-dose and low-dose ZYP both exhibited significant interventional effects on colitis rat models, and high-dose ZYP produced a better interventional effect compared with low-dose ZYP. Based on a metabolomics test of fecal samples, significantly altered metabolites in the model and high-dose ZYP treatment groups were identified. In total, 492 metabolites were differentially expressed. Additionally, sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene in fecal samples revealed that the high-dose ZYP could improve TNBS-induced fecal microbiota dysbiosis. Ultimately, changes in tryptophan metabolism and <em>Firmicutes</em> and <em>Gammaproteobacteria</em> populations were detected after ZYP treatment in both colitis and cholestasis. Therefore, we conclude that tryptophan metabolism and <em>Firmicutes</em> and <em>Gammaproteobacteria</em> populations are the core targets of the anti-inflammatory effect of ZYP. These findings provide a scientific basis for further investigation of the anti-inflammatory mechanism of ZYP in the future.</p>",

                        "description": "<p><strong>Animals and Treatments</strong></p><p>In total 24 male Sprague-Dawley rats aged 7-8 weeks, weighing 180 \u00b1 20 g, were purchased from Chengdu Dossy Experimental Animals Co., Ltd (Sichuan, China; certification no. SCXK-CHUAN 2020-030). All rats were housed under conventional conditions and had access to water and food ad libitum.The environment was maintained at a constant temperature (25 \u00b1 2 \u00b0C) with 50% humidity and a 12/12 h light/dark cycle. Rats were acclimatized for 7 days prior to the experiments. The rats were randomly allocated into the control, model, low-dose ZYP (ZYP_L) and high-dose ZYP (ZYP_H) groups. Each group consisted of 6 rats. Except the normal group, all groups were administered with a single TNBS enema to induce acute colitis (100 mg/kg)<strong>[1]</strong>, 8 cm from the anus, using a catheter. The normal group was administered the same amount of vehicle (paroline) enema as the control. After the injection, the rats\u2019 anuses were clamped and the rats were maintained in a head-down position for 15 min. After TNBS induction, rats were administered ZYP (ZYP_L: 0.6 g/kg, ZYP_H: 1.2 g/kg) for 10 consecutive days, once a day via oral gavage. The ZYP doses used were based on the maximum recommended clinical dose of 12 g per 60 kg/day. The control and model groups were given an equal volume of distilled water. The rats were provided with standard chow and water on completion of treatments.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Sample Collection and Intestinal Injury Evaluation</strong></p><p>After the final ZYP administration, 2 fresh fecal pellets were collected from each rat. Fecal samples were stored frozen at -80 \u00b0C until analysis until further metabolic profiling and microbial community analysis, respectively. A detailed protocol for this study has been previously described<strong>[2]</strong>. After 17 days, rats were euthanized 16 h after the final ZYP administration. The distal 8-cm portion of the colon was excised immediately afterward. The colon length was measured with a ruler, and the colon was weighed. The weight-to-length ratio, representing the colon weight index (g/cm), was used to ascertain the degree of colon edema or retraction caused by inflammation. As previously described<strong>[3]</strong>, disease activity index (DAI) is an effective indicator for evaluating colitis. In this study, body weight, stool viscosity, and bleeding status were recorded daily and scored with reference to the scoring standard<strong>[4]</strong>. The DAI results were calculated according to the following equation, as reported in a previous study<strong>[5]</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ethical Approval</strong></p><p>Ethics approval was granted by the Ethics Committee of Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (Ethics Approval Number: 2019-15).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Reagents</strong></p><p>TNBS was prepared using 5% TNBS (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and diluted to a final concentration of 2% TNBS and 50% ethanol with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). <em>Coptis chinensis</em> Franch. and <em>Tetradium ruticarpum</em> (A. Jussieu) T. G. Hartley were purchased from Beijing Tongrentang Science and Technology Development Co., Ltd (Beijing, China). L,-2-chlorophenylalanine was obtained from Shanghai Hengchuang Biotechnology Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China). Water, methanol, acetonitrile and formic acid were purchased from CNW Technologies GmbH (D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany). All chemicals and solvents were reagent grade or high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analytical grade.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>ZYP Preparation and Quality Control</strong></p><p>ZYP was composed of 2 herbs. All compositions of ZYP are listed in <strong>Table 1</strong> in the paper associated with this study. In previous studies, we used HPLC to detect the content of the main components of ZYP. As a result, ZYP contained 36.8 mg/g of berberine, 14.9 mg/g of coptisine, 0.78 mg/g of evodiamine and 0.33 mg/g of rutecarpine. The fingerprints of different batches of ZYP decoction showed a consistent trend, indicating that ZYP has botanical characteristics<strong>[6]</strong>. In this study, ZYP was prepared as a decoction based on clinical application. In this study, the preparation of ZYP was consistent with that of our previous studies. Therefore, 120 mL of solution was extracted from 12 g of herbs; the final concentration of ZYP was 0.1 g/mL (w/v).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Ji E, Wang T, Xu J, Fan J, Zhang Y, Guan Y, Yang H, Wei J, Zhang G, Huang L.
