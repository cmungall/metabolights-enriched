                "description": "Background: The aim of this study is to determine the feasibility of using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) tracer studies (13C-enriched glucose) to detect ex vivo de novo metabolism in the perfusion fluid and cortical tissue of porcine kidneys during hypothermic machine perfusion (HMP). Methods: Porcine kidneys (n=6) were subjected to 24hrs of HMP using the Organ Recovery Systems LifePort Kidney perfusion device. Glucose, uniformly enriched with the stable isotope 13C ([U-13C] glucose) was incorporated into KPS-1-like perfusion fluid at a concentration of 10 mM. Analysis of perfusate was performed using both 1D 1H and 2D 1H,13C Heteronuclear single quantum coherence NMR spectroscopy (HSQC). The metabolic activity was then studied by quantifying the proportion of key metabolites containing 13C in both perfusate and tissue samples. Results: There was significant enrichment of 13C in a number of central metabolites present in both the perfusate and tissue extracts and was most pronounced for lactate and alanine. The total amount of enriched lactate (per sample) in perfusion fluid increased during HMP (31.1 \u00b1 12.2 nmol at 6 hrs vs 93.4 \u00b1 25.6 nmol at 24 hrs p<0.01). The total amount of enriched alanine increased in a similar fashion (1.73 \u00b1 0.89 nmol at 6hrs vs 6.80 \u00b1 2.56 nmol at 24hrs (p<0.05). In addition, small amounts of enriched acetate and glutamic acid was evident in some samples. Conclusions: This study conclusively demonstrates that de novo metabolism occurs during HMP and highlights active metabolic pathways in this hypothermic, hypoxic environment. While the majority of the 13C-enriched glucose is metabolised into glycolytic endpoint metabolites such as lactate, the presence of non-glycolytic pathway derivatives suggests that metabolism during HMP is more complex than previously thought. Isotopic labelled ex vivo organ perfusion studies using 2D-NMR are feasible and informative.",

To replicate human conditions, kidneys were initially cold flushed (4 \u00b0C) with 1 l Soltran solution under aseptic conditions at a pressure of 150 mmHg, followed by 2 h of cold storage. Organs were then perfused with 1 l of a modified version of KPS-1 solution containing 10 mM of [U-13C]-labelled glucose and 30 g of PEG 35 kDa as an impermeant in place of hydroxyethyl starch. The LifePort Kidney Transporter 1.0 (Organ Recovery Systems) was used for perfusion at a pressure of 30 mmHg (see Fig. 1 in the paper associated with this study).\n</p>\nKidneys were perfused for 24 h with perfusate sampled at times 6, 12, 18 and 24 hr from each kidney via the designated LifePort sampling port and stored at -20 \u00b0C. The samples were thawed at room temperature, prepared and processed as described below. Kidney cortex tissue samples were also taken at the study endpoint and flash frozen prior to homogenization.\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Nath J, Guy A, Smith TB, Cobbold M, Inston NG, Hodson J, Tennant DA, Ludwig C, Ready AR.

Briefly, 1.5 ml of perfusate was combined with 1.5 ml of chilled methanol (at -80 \u00b0C) and 1.5 ml chloroform (i.e. a 1:1:1 ratio). This was mixed vigorously for 10 min and then cooled on wet ice for 10 min. The polar and non-polar phases were separated by centrifugation (1300 x g for 15 min at 4 \u00b0C) as described elsewhere[1][2]] and 2 ml of the polar fraction aspirated and dried at 30 \u00b0C overnight.\n</p>\nTissues:</br>\nImmediately after storage, the kidneys were laterally bisected and sections of cortex were excised and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Sections of cortex were then pulverised to a fine powder using a manual cryogrinder. After this, 0.5 g of the powdered sample was added to a 7-ml Precellys homogenisation tube containing 5.1 ml of chilled methanol (-80 \u00b0C) to quench ongoing metabolism. The sample was homogenised using the Precellys 24 Dual homogeniser set at the lowest mode (5000 rpm for 15 s) until fully homogenised (this was standardised to 8 courses of the lowest setting with cooling in dry ice between runs to prevent overheating). Once homogenised, the samples were mixed with 4.65 ml ultrapure water accounting for the estimated 79% water (around 395 \u00b5l) present in the tissue already[3] and 5.1 ml chloroform (i.e. a 1:1:1 ratio as with the perfusate samples).\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Serkova N, Fuller TF, Klawitter J, Freise CE, Niemann CU.

                        "description": "1D-1H NMR spectra were processed using the MATLAB-based MetaboLab software[1]. All 1D data sets were zero-filled to 131,072 data points prior to Fourier transformation. The chemical shift was calibrated by referencing the DSS signal to 0 ppm. 1D spectra were manually phase corrected before correcting the spectral baseline using a spline function[1].\n</p>\n2D 1H,13C HSQC NMR spectra were reconstructed with compressed sensing using the MDDNMR and NMRpipe software[2]-[4]. The spectra were zero-filled to 1024 (1H) times 16,384 (13C) real data points. HSQC spectra were then analysed using MetaboLab, which uses the pyGamma software for multiplet simulations[5]. The methyl group of lactate was used to calibrate the chemical shift based on its assignment in the human metabolome database [22].\n</p>\nData were analysed using GraphPad Prism v6 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, USA). Data were reported as mean \u00b1 SD, unless stated otherwise. Statistical significance was tested using two-tailed Student\u2019s t test. A p value of <0.05 was considered significant.\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Ludwig C, G\u00fcnther UL. MetaboLab--advanced NMR data processing and analysis for metabolomics.
