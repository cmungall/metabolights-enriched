                "description": "<p><strong>OBJECTIVE:</strong> This study aimed to investigate the regulatory impact of early swimming intervention on striatal metabolism in Shank3 gene knockout ASD model rats. </p><p><strong>METHODS:</strong> Shank3 gene knockout exon 11-21 male 8-day-old SD rats were used as experimental subjects and randomly divided into three groups: Shank3 knockout control group (KC), wild-type control group (WC) from the same litter and Shank3 knockout swimming group (KS). Rats in the exercise group received early swimming intervention for 8 weeks starting at 8 days old. GC-MS metabolism was employed to detect the changes of metabolites in striatum. </p><p><strong>RESULTS:</strong> There were 17 differential metabolites (14 down-regulated) between the KC and WC groups, 19 differential metabolites (18 up-regulated) between the KS and KC groups and 22 differential metabolites (18 up-regulated) between the KS and WC groups. </p><p><strong>CONCLUSION:</strong> The metabolism of striatum in Shank3 knockout ASD model rats is disrupted, involving metabolites related to synaptic morphology, Glu and GABAergic synapses are abnormal. Early swimming intervention regulated the striatal metabolome group of ASD model rats, with differential metabolites primarily related to nerve development, synaptic membrane structure and synaptic signal transduction.</p>",

The germline deletion of Shank3, specifically targeting exon 11-21, was generated using CRISPR-Cas9 technology<strong>[1]</strong>. Shank3-/+&nbsp;rats, both male and female, were generated by backcrossing Shank3-/- rats with Shank3+/+ SD rates. Subsequently,&nbsp;the Shank3-/+&nbsp;rats were bred to obtain both&nbsp;SD Shank3+/+&nbsp;and Shank3-/-&nbsp;rats for experimental groups. The rats&nbsp;were randomly allocated&nbsp;into 3 groups based on their genotype and treatment: Shank3-/-&nbsp;control group (KC; n=3), Shank3+/+&nbsp;littermates (WC; n=3) and Shank3-/-&nbsp;swimming group (KS; n=3). The rats were housed in cages containing 3 animals, with free access to food and water, in a room maintained at a temperature of 20-25 \u00b0C, 45-55% humidity and a 12-h light/dark cycle. All animal procedures and care were conducted in strict accordance with ethical standards and protocols outlined by the National Institutes of Health (US) [cite PMID 21595115] and were approved by the Biomedical Ethics Committee of Beijing University (ethics number: LA2021552). After the experiment, all the animals were euthanized by intraperitoneal injection of barbiturates.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Early swimming exercise program</strong></p><p>The swimming protocol employed in this study was adapted from a prior study by Muniz<strong>[2]</strong> and was performed on rats in the KS group as depicted in Figure 1 in the paper associated with this study. Initial adaptation to swimming was implemented for the rats in the KS group, as illustrated in Figure 1<strong>[3][4]</strong>. Initial acclimation to swimming took place during post-natal days (PND) 8-10 in a cage measuring 485 x 50 x 200 mm, filled with water maintained at a temperature of 32 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C. The duration of each session was 2 min on PND 8, 5 min on PND 9 and 10 min on PND 10. On PND8, water level was the height of the legs. On PND9, the water level was the height of the stomach. On PND10, the water level was the height of the neck. Starting from PND 13, the swimming intervention was conducted in a circular tank (150 cm in diameter, 100 cm in height), filled with temperature-controlled (32 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C) to a depth of 50 cm, a setup that remained consistent for the remainder of the experiment. The duration of each session was 15 min on PND 13, 20 min on PND 14 and 25 min on PND 15. Between PND16-26, rthe rats engaged in 30 min of swimming per day, with 5 consecutive days of swimming followed by 2 days of rest per week. The duration of the swimming sessions was extended to 40 min per day from PND 27 to 60.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Striatalmetabolite analysis</strong></p><p>The rats were euthanized using Pentobarbital sodium at a dose of 150 mg/kg, followed by the careful removal of their brains. To access the striatum, forceps were applied to the medial cortex. Approximately 100 mg (\u00b12%) of striatal tissue was then transferred into a high-throughput tissue grinder containing 1 mL of tissue extraction buffer kept at -20 \u00b0C.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Song TJ, Lan XY, Wei MP, Zhai FJ, Boeckers TM, Wang JN, Yuan S, Jin MY, Xie YF, Dang WW, Zhang C, Sch\u00f6n M, Song PW, Qiu MH, Song YY, Han SP, Han JS, Zhang R.

The parameters of R2X, R2Y and Q2 were extracted. The relative values of metabolites under different experimental conditions were used as metabolic levels to do hierarchical cluster analysis, and the results were expressed as heat maps and were screened to find differential metabolites between groups. The metabolites were considered significantly different at p-value &lt; 0.05 and variable importance in projection score (VIP) &gt; 1. The MetPA database was used to analyze the relevant metabolic pathways for each group of differential metabolites, the hypergeometric test algorithm was used for data analysis, Relative-betweenness Centrality was used for pathway topology analysis.</p>",
