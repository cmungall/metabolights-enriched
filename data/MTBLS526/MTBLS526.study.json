                "description": "In this study, the effects of coronatine treatment on the growth, comprehensive metabolic profiles, and productivity of bioactive compounds, including phenolics and phytosterols, in whole plant cultures of Lemna paucicostata were investigated using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) coupled with multivariate statistical analysis. To determine the optimal timing of coronatine elicitation, coronatine was added on days 0, 23, and 28 after inoculation. The total growth of L. paucicostata was not significantly different between the coronatine treated groups and the control. The coronatine treatment in L. paucicostata induced increases in the content of hydroxycinnamic acids, such as caffeic acid, isoferulic acid, \u03c1-coumaric acid, sinapic acid, and phytosterols, such as campesterol and \u03b2-sitosterol. The productivity of these useful metabolites was highest when coronatine was added on day 0 and harvested on day 32. These results suggest that coronatine treatment on day 0 activates the phenolic and phytosterol biosynthetic pathways in L. paucicostata to a greater extent than in the control. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to investigate the effects of coronatine on the alteration of metabolism in L. paucicostata based on GC-MS profiling. The results of this research provide a foundation for designing strategies for enhanced production of useful metabolites for pharmaceutical and nutraceutical industries by cultivation of L. paucicostata.",

The whole L. paucicostata plants were cultured on solid 1/2MS1BA medium (20 ml) containing half-strength Murashige and Skoog\u2019s basal medium[2] supplemented with 1 mg/l benzylaminopurine (BA), 30 g/l sucrose, and 6 g/l Gelrite (Duchefa Biochemie, Haarlem, The Netherlands) on once every 2 weeks. The pH was adjusted to 5.8 prior to autoclaving at 121 \u00b0C for 20 min. The liquid 1/2MS1BA medium was prepared as described above, but did not contain Gelrite. 30 of L. paucicostata fronds (length: 3.5 mm, width: 2.5 mm, thinkness < 0.09 mm per one frond) were transferred to Erlenmeyer flasks filled with 100 ml of liquid 1/2MS1BA medium.\n</p>\n30 L. paucicostata plants were inoculated into Erlenmeyer flasks containing 100 ml of liquid 1/2MS1BA medium and were treated with 1 \u03bcM coronatine on day 0, day 23 (mid exponential stage), and day 28 (early stationary stage). The coronatine treatment time points of day 23 and 28 were determined from preliminary experiments based on total plant growth of L. paucicostata including meristem region and differentiated tissues (see Fig S1 in the paper associated with this study). The experiments were performed in 4 replicates. The plants, sampled at day 27 and 32, were freeze-dried using a freeze-drier (Bondiro, Ilshin Lab. Co., Ltd., Seoul, Republic of Korea) for 48 h and used for further analysis.\n</p>\nThe number of the fronds was counted on days 0, 7, 14, 21, 27, 28, and 32, and the dry weight of the L. paucicostata cultivated in the presence of 1 \u03bcM coronatine was measured after harvesting on day at 27 and 32. After filtering through Whatman No. 4 filter paper (Whatman, Kent, UK), and washing with distilled water, the dry weights were measured after 48 h of freeze drying.\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Gupta, A.K. 2013.

The normalization was then performed by dividing the intensity of each compound with that of the IS for relative quantification of the metabolites in each sample. Statistical analysis was performed by SPSS Statistics 23 software (IBM, Somers, NY, USA). Mann-Whitney test was employed to assess 2 independent groups (between groups of L. paucicostata under control and coronatine treatment at day 0). Comparisons of relative levels of comprehensive metabolites in 3 groups [control and the samples taken at day 27 (or day 32) after coronatine treatment at day 0, and day 23 (or day 28)] was assessed by the Kruskal-Wallis test, followed by Mann-Whitney test as post hoc analysis with Bonferroni\u2019s correction.",
