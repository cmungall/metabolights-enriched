                "description": "<p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> Lactation is extremely important for dairy cows; however, the understanding of the underlying metabolic mechanisms is very limited. This study was conducted to investigate the inherent metabolic patterns during lactation using the overall biofluid metabolomics and the metabolic differences from non-lactation periods, as determined using partial tissue-metabolomics. We analyzed the metabolomic profiles of four biofluids (rumen fluid, serum, milk and urine) and their relationships in six mid-lactation Holstein cows and compared their mammary gland (MG) metabolomic profiles with those of six non-lactating cows by using gas chromatography-time of flight/mass spectrometry. </p><p><strong>RESULTS:</strong> In total, 33 metabolites were shared among the four biofluids, and 274 metabolites were identified in the MG tissues. The sub-clusters of the hierarchical clustering analysis revealed that the rumen fluid and serum metabolomics profiles were grouped together and highly correlated but were separate from those for milk. Urine had the most different profile compared to the other three biofluids. Creatine was identified as the most different metabolite among the four biofluids (VIP=1.537). Five metabolic pathways, including gluconeogenesis, pyruvate metabolism, the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle), glycerolipid metabolism, and aspartate metabolism, showed the most functional enrichment among the four biofluids (false discovery rate&lt;0.05, fold enrichment &gt;2). Clear discriminations were observed in the MG metabolomics profiles between the lactating and non-lactating cows, with 54 metabolites having a significantly higher abundance (P&lt;0.05, VIP&gt;1) in the lactation group. Lactobionic acid, citric acid, orotic acid and oxamide were extracted by the S-plot as potential biomarkers of the metabolic difference between lactation and non-lactation. The TCA cycle, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, glutamate metabolism and glycine metabolism were determined to be pathways that were significantly impacted (P&lt;0.01, impact value &gt;0.1) in the lactation group. Among them, the TCA cycle was the most up-regulated pathway (P&lt;0.0001), with 7 of the 10 related metabolites increased in the MG tissues of the lactating cows. </p><p><strong>CONCLUSIONS:</strong> The overall biofluid and MG tissue metabolic mechanisms in the lactating cows were interpreted in this study. Our findings are the first to provide an integrated insight and a better understanding of the metabolic mechanism of lactation, which is beneficial for developing regulated strategies to improve the metabolic status of lactating dairy cows.</p>",

Among them, 6 multiparous dairy cows with similar milk yields (30.4\u00b12.29 kg/d, mean\u00b1SD) and at similar lactation stages (days in milk=164\u00b119.6 d, mean\u00b1SD) were fed a diet with a forage-to-concentrate ratio of 45:55, and they were provided 16.7% (DM basis) crude protein and 1.57 Mcal/kg net energy for lactation, following the protocol described in our previous study[1]. The diet ingredients and nutrient composition are commonly applied in state-of-the-art farms throughout China (see Table S1 in the paper associated with this study). Approximately 1000 mg of mammary gland tissues were collected immediately after slaughter according to previously described methods[2] from each cow in both the lactation and non-lactation groups. Liver samples were also removed by a previously described method[3]. The tissues were then stored at -80 \u00b0C until metabolite extraction. Biofluid samples, including 50 ml of rumen fluid, 50 ml of milk, 10 ml of blood and 10 ml of urine, were collected from the lactating cows before the morning feeding at 6:00 AM. Rumen fluid was collected using an oral stomach tube following the standard procedures[4], milk samples were collected using a milk sampling device (Waikato Milking Systems NZ Ltd., Waikato, Hamilton, New Zealand), blood samples were collected from the jugular vein using pro-coagulation 10-ml tubes, and urine samples were collected using the vulval stimulation method. To minimize any possible degradation of the metabolites, rumen fluid, milk and urine samples were infused into a 15-ml sterilized centrifuge tube and immediately placed in liquid nitrogen. Before storage in a -80 \u00b0C freezer, the rumen fluid, milk and urine samples were centrifuged at 6000 x g, 3000 x g, and 3000 x g, respectively, and incubated at 4 \u00b0C for 15 min. Blood samples were centrifuged at 4 \u00b0C, 3000 x g for 15 min within 20 min after sample collection.

The tissue metabolomics procedures were performed as follows. First, 100 mg of mammary gland tissue from each sample was added to a 2-ml Eppendorf tube with 0.4 ml of methanol:chloroform (3:1, v/v) and 30 \u00b5l of L-2-chlorophenylalanine (1 mg/ml, stored in dH2O) and was mixed by vortexing for 10 s. Second, steel balls were placed in the tube and milled for 5 min at 55 Hz. The sample was then centrifuged at 4 \u00b0C at 12,000 rpm for 15 min. Third, approximately 0.4 ml of supernatant was transferred into a 2 ml silylated vial. An equal volume (10 \u00b5l) of each sample was placed in a new 2 ml silylated vial as a mixed sample for the quality control of the stability of the equipment system, the standard deviation of the beginning, middle and ending retention time of the mixed samples was less than 0.2, which indicates good stability.\n</p>\nMetabolite derivatization:</br>\nThe extracts were dried in a vacuum concentrator at 30 \u00b0C for 1.5 hr. Methoxymethyl amine salt (80 \u00b5l; dissolved in pyridine to a final concentration of 20 mg/ml) was added to the dried metabolites, mixed and gently sealed. The solution was then incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 2 hr in an oven. Then, 100 \u00b5l of bis trifluoroacetamide (containing 1% trimethylchlorosilane, v/v) was added to each sample, which was sealed again and incubated at 70 \u00b0C for 1 hr. In addition, 10 \u00b5l of fatty acid methyl esters (a standard mixture of fatty acid methyl esters, C8-C16: 1 mg/ml; C18-C30: 0.5 mg/ml in chloroform) was added to the mixed sample and cooled to room temperature. Finally, the samples were mixed well and subjected to gas chromatography-time of flight/mass spectrometry (GC-TOF/MS) testing.\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Sun H, Wang B, Wang J, Liu H, Liu J.
