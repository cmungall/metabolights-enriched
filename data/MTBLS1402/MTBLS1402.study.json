                "description": "Cell cycle progression requires the coordination of cell growth, chromosome replication, and division. Consequently, a functional cell cycle must be coupled with metabolism. However, direct measurements of metabolome dynamics remained scarce, in particular in bacteria. Here, we describe an untargeted metabolomics approach with synchronized Caulobacter crescentus cells to monitor the relative abundance changes of ~400 putative metabolites as a function of the cell cycle. While the majority of metabolite pools remains homeostatic, ~14% respond to cell cycle progression. In particular, sulfur metabolism is redirected during the G1-S transition, and glutathione levels periodically change over the cell cycle with a peak in late S phase. A lack of glutathione perturbs cell size by uncoupling cell growth and division through dysregulation of KefB, a K+/H+ antiporter. Overall, we here describe the impact of the C. crescentus cell cycle progression on metabolism, and in turn relate glutathione and potassium homeostasis to timely cell division.",

To this end, a culture volume corresponding to 1 ml OD600 of 1.0 was passed through a polyethersulfone filter (0.2 um, Sartorius Setim) placed on a vaccum-filtration apparatus. The medium was separated from cells and discarded as a flow through and cells were washed by quickly drawing 10 ml dH2O supplemented with 2 mM glucose through the filter. The filter situating bacterial cells was then immediately quenched in pre-cooled (-20 \u00b0C) glass bottles (Schott) containing 8 ml quenching and extraction solution (60/20/20 % V/V acetonitrile/methanol/dH2O acidified to a final concentration of 0.1M formic acid). Cells were extracted for 10 min on ice with repeated treatment in a bath sonifier (Branson). The filter was removed, and the extract was frozen in liquid nitrogen and lyophilized overnight at -48 \u00b0C. Finally, the dried extract was re-suspended in dH2O, centrifuged twice (10,000 g and 20,000 g, 10 min each, 4 \u00b0C) and was stored at -80 \u00b0C until further analysis.</p>",

A detailed description can be obtained from Supplementary Methods of the <a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7035108/' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>study manuscript</a> and at https://pypi.org/project/idms-pairfinder-2/. </p><p>Briefly, for each of the 6 sampled batches (i.e. three replicates of cell cycle synchronized and their respective asynchronous control cultures), a corresponding naturally labelled extract (12C), the u-13C enriched standard (13C) and mixture (mix) of both extracts were acquired with the two described, non-targeted LC-HRMS techniques. The data was converted to mzML files and was submitted to a workflow aiming at detection and isolation of extraction windows of U12C \u2013 U13C pairs corresponding to intracellular metabolites of C. crescentus. To this end, custom spectral processing and stable isotope assisted filtering was employed to build respective consensus tables containing the extraction windows (U12C-U13C pairs) of reproducibly detected metabolites for each applied LC-HRMS method.</p><p><br></p><p>Then, these tailored extraction tables were used for targeted extraction of respective unlabeled (12C) and fully labeled (13C) peak pairs of all detected metabolites throughout the time series of the batch. The targeted extraction algorithm allowed for minor retention time shifts occurring for data acquired by nano-scale LC-HRMS. Peak areas where then calculated using numerical integration with a trapezoid rule. As 12C extracts and 13C internal standards were normalized to a constant biomass during sampling, relative pool size R of metabolite i at time point t was calculated as the ratio of peak areas AU12C over AU13C. After processing of all samples, individual metabolites with high variability over time and between replicates were manually inspected and curated. As an additional quality criteria, peak pairs where the U13C signal did not exceed the limit of quantification (LOQ, 10x signal to noise) were discarded from analysis, and only metabolite features that contained &gt;75% U13C signals per time-series were considered for analysis. Spectral noise levels were determined for each individual measurement (for details see Supplementary Methods of the linked manuscript).</p><p><br></p>",

In case of adduct assignment missing, protonated or deprotonated ions were assumed depending on the ionization mode. In case no charge state could be assigned the charge states z = 1, 2, 3 were assumed and for each charge state the corresponding number of possible carbon atoms was calculated, respectively. Results were matched with KEGG data base5 and with a merged database consisting of an E. coli model (iML1515) merged with C. crescentus Seed model (Seed190650_1). Merging was required since seed model database was not manually curated and known core metabolites were missing in the model. Resulting annotations by database matching are listed in Supplementary Tables 1, 2 of the linked manuscript. Cell cycle dependent candidate features were further annotated using analytical standards (matching retention time), and/or tandem mass spectrometry followed by spectral matching using the dereplication workflow of GNPS (https://gnps.ucsd.edu/). Respective MS level 2 spectra were averaged over the elution window size of the LC-MS peak and 20 most intense spectral signals were picked for further analysis. All available spectral libraries from GNPS were initially queried with a precursor ion mass tolerance of 1 Da, a fragment ion mass tolerance of 0.5, a minimum of 5 matched peaks, and a minimum cosine score threshold of 0.7. If no match was acquired, search was extended to analogs with a maximum parent mass difference of 250 Da. Note that the metabolite tables listed here only describe metabolites that were flagged as cell-cycle dependent and that produced a database match; unknowns are not included but listed in the linked manuscript.</p>",
