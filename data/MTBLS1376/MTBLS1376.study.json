                "description": "<p>Here we present LipidCreator, a software that fully supports targeted lipidomics assay development. LipidCreator offers a comprehensive framework to compute MS/MS fragment masses for over 60 lipid classes. LipidCreator provides all functionalities needed to define fragments, manage stable isotope labeling, optimize collision energy and generate in silico spectral libraries. We validate LipidCreator assays computationally and analytically and prove that it is capable to generate large targeted experiments to analyze blood and to dissect lipid-signaling pathways such as in human platelets.</p><p><br></p><p>In MTBLS1376, to validate the performance and accuracy of the transition lists provided by LipidCreator, we validated our theoretical calculations and the transition lists computed by LipidCreator experimentally, monitoring true and false targets on the model organism Saccharomyces <em>cerevisiae</em>. The lipidome of the yeast S. <em>cerevisiae</em> is well described and has been thoroughly investigated before. It has a limited number of fatty acyls and double bonds, and certain fatty acyls and lipid classes do not occur in it, which is important for our consecutive false identification calculations. Therefore, the yeast matrix from the theoretical calculation, 21 target lipids and 21 decoy lipids from commercially available lipid standards that are known to not be present in the yeast lipidome were selected. Based on our previous results, none of the lipid species was redundant among all three sets.</p><p><br></p><p>Studies linked to this manuscript include;</p><p><a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS1333' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>MTBLS1333; LipidCreator: Collision Energy Optimization and Fragment Intensity Prediction for Lipid Mediators - Thermo QExactive HF</a></p><p><a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS1334' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>MTBLS1334; LipidCreator: Collision Energy Optimization and Fragment Intensity Prediction for Lipid Mediators - Agilent QTof</a></p><p><a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS1369' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>MTBLS1369; LipidCreator: Platelet isolation and stimulation - Targeted Phospho- and Glycerolipid Profiling</a></p><p><a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS1375' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>MTBLS1375; LipidCreator: Targeted lipidomics analysis of Human Plasma samples and comparison with NIST SRM 1950 standard</a></p><p><a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS1376' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>MTBLS1376; LipidCreator: Targeted lipidomics analysis of S. cerevisiae to determine true and false identification</a></p><p><a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS1381' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>MTBLS1381; LipidCreator: Platelet isolation and stimulation - Targeted Lipid Mediator Profiling</a></p><p><a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS1382' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>MTBLS1382; LipidCreator: Platelet isolation and stimulation - DIA Lipid Mediator Validation</a></p>",

The chromatographic separation was performed according to Bird et al.

The temperatures of the autosampler and the column oven were set at 10 \u00b0C and 45 \u00b0C, respectively. Solvent A was ACN/H2O (3:2, v/v) and solvent B was IPA/ACN (9:1, v/v). Both solvents contained 0.1 % formic acid, and 10 mM ammonium formate. The separation was carried out at a flow rate of 0.26 ml/min with the following 30 min long gradient: 0.0-1.5 min (hold 32 % B), 1.5-4.0 min (32-45 % B), 4.0-5.0 min (45-52 % B), 5.0-8.0 min (52-58 % B), 8.0-11.0 min (58-66 % B), 11.0-14.0 min (66-70 % B), 14.0-18.0 min (70-75 % B), 18.0-21.0 min (75-97 % B), 21.0-25.0 min (97 % B), 25.0-30.0 min (32 % B).
