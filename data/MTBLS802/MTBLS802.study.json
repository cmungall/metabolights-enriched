                "description": "<h4><strong>AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: </strong>Metabolic dysregulation may precede the onset of type 1 diabetes. However, these metabolic disturbances and their specific role in disease initiation remain poorly understood. In this study, we examined whether children who progress to type 1 diabetes have a circulatory polar metabolite profile distinct from that of children who later progress to islet autoimmunity but not type 1 diabetes and a matched control group.</h4><h4><strong>METHODS: </strong>We analysed polar metabolites from 415 longitudinal plasma samples in a prospective cohort of children in three study groups: those who progressed to type 1 diabetes; those who seroconverted to one islet autoantibody but not to type 1 diabetes; and an antibody-negative control group. Metabolites were measured using two-dimensional GC high-speed time of flight MS.</h4><h4><strong>RESULTS: </strong>In early infancy, progression to type 1 diabetes was associated with downregulated amino acids, sugar derivatives and fatty acids, including catabolites of microbial origin, compared with the control group. Methionine remained persistently upregulated in those progressing to type 1 diabetes compared with the control group and those who seroconverted to one islet autoantibody. The appearance of islet autoantibodies was associated with decreased glutamic and aspartic acids.</h4><h4><strong>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: </strong>Our findings suggest that children who progress to type 1 diabetes have a unique metabolic profile, which is, however, altered with the appearance of islet autoantibodies. Our findings may assist with early prediction of the disease.</h4>",

The participants in the current study were from the <strong>Tampere cohort[2]</strong>. The ethics and research committee of the participating university hospital approved the study protocol and the study followed the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki. Parents of all participants gave written informed consent at the beginning of the study. The samples were collected at up to 6 different time points, corresponding to the ages of 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 and 36 mth (or above). This longitudinal cohort comprises samples from 120 children: 40 progressors to type 1 diabetes (<strong>PT1D</strong>); 40 who tested positive for at least 1 antibody in a minimum of 2 consecutive samples but did not progress to clinical type 1 diabetes during the follow-up (<strong>P1Ab</strong>); and 40 control (<strong>CTRL</strong>) children who remained islet autoantibody-negative during the follow-up until the age of 15 yr. The participants in the 3 study groups were matched for HLA-associated diabetes risk, sex and period of birth (see <strong>Table S1</strong> in the paper associated with this study). In total, we collected 415 non-fasting blood samples. Plasma was separated within 30 min of blood collection by centrifugation at 1600 x g for 20 min at room temperature. The plasma samples were stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until analysed.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Kupila A, Muona P, Simell T, Arvilommi P, Savolainen H, H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen AM, Korhonen S, Kimpim\u00e4ki T, Sj\u00f6roos M, Ilonen J, Knip M, Simell O; Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation Centre for the Prevention of Type I Diabetes in Finland.

Polar metabolites were extracted in methanol (400 \u03bcl), as previously described<strong>[1]</strong>. For quality control and normalisation, a group-specific internal standard mix of <strong>heptadecanoic acid-d33</strong> (175.36 mg/l), valine-d8 (35.72 mg/l), <strong>succinic acid-d4</strong> (58.54 mg/l) and <strong>glutamic acid-d5</strong> (110.43 mg/l) (Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany) was added to the extraction solvent. Samples were vortexed and left to precipitate for 30 min on ice. After precipitation, extracts were centrifuged (centrifuge 5427 R; Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) for 3 min on 12,520 x g. A 180 \u03bcl sample of supernatant fraction was transferred into GC vials and stored for further use. The same procedure was applied for clinic-pooled plasma, which was used for quality control and batch correction. The quantification was performed using calibration curves prepared using the following standards (Sigma-Aldrich): <strong>fumaric acid</strong>, <strong>aspartic acid</strong>, <strong>succinic acid</strong>, <strong>malic acid</strong>, <strong>methionine</strong>, <strong>tyrosine</strong>, <strong>glutamic acid</strong>, <strong>phenylalanine</strong>, <strong>arachidonic acid</strong>, <strong>isoleucine</strong>, <strong>3-hydroxybutyric acid</strong>, <strong>glycine</strong>, <strong>threonine</strong>, <strong>leucine</strong>, <strong>proline</strong>, <strong>serine</strong>, <strong>valine</strong>, <strong>alanine</strong>, <strong>stearic acid</strong>, <strong>linoleic acid</strong>, <strong>palmitic acid</strong> and <strong>oleic acid</strong>. Standards were dissolved in methanol. The calibration curves included at least six concentration points that ranged from 1 ng/sample to 3000 ng/sample, depending on the abundance in plasma. R2 was from 97.1% up to 99.9%.</p><p><br></p><p>Derivatisation was performed instrumentally using an MPS2 (Gerstel, M\u00fclheim an der Ruhr, Germany). Samples were evaporated to dryness and derivatisation was performed in 2 steps (see the Supplementary Methods in the paper associated with this study). Briefly, in the first step 25 \u03bcl of <strong>methoxyamine hydrochloride</strong> (TS-45950; Thermo Scientific: USA) was added to the sample. While mixing, the solution was incubated for 1 hr at 45 \u00b0C. In the second step, 25 \u03bcl of <strong>N-methyl-N-trimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide</strong> (Sigma-Aldrich; Steinheim, Germany) was added. Incubation was again performed for 1 hr at 45 \u00b0C. Before injection 50 \u03bcl of hexane was added to increase the volatility of the solvent. Additional standards here added during derivatization. n-alkanes (c = 8 mg/l in MSTFA) were used for calculation of retention indexes and 4,4\u2032-dibromooctafluorobiphenyl (c = 9.8 mg/l in hexane) were used as syringe standard to control the quality of injection.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Hartonen M, Mattila I, Ruskeep\u00e4\u00e4 AL, Ore\u0161i\u010d M, Hy\u00f6tyl\u00e4inen T.

Derivatised compounds were analysed using a Pegasus 4D system (LECO, St Joseph, MI, USA). The method used is based on two-dimensional GC followed by high-speed time of flight acquisition of electron-ionisation-fragmented mass spectra. The primary column had internal dimensions 10 m x 0.18 mm (Rxi-5 ms, Restek Bellefonte, PA, USA) and the secondary column was 1.5 m x 0.1 mm (BPX-50, SGE Analytical Science, Austin, TX, USA). The system was guarded by a retention gap column of deactivated silica (internal dimensions 1.7 m, 0.53 mm, fused silica deactivated; Agilent Technologies, CA, USA). The modulator used nitrogen gas, which was cryogenically cooled. The second dimension cycle was 4 s. The temperature programme started at 50 \u00b0C (2 min), then a gradient of 7 \u00b0C up to 240 \u00b0C was applied and then finally a gradient of 25 \u00b0C/min to 300 \u00b0C, where it was held stable for 3 min. The temperature programme of the secondary column was maintained at 20 \u00b0C higher than the primary column. The acquisition rate was kept at 100 Hz. The instrument was guided by <strong>ChromaTOF software (version 4.32, LECO)</strong>.</p>",
