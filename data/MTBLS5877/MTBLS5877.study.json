                "description": "<p>The Krebs cycle-derived metabolite itaconate, whose production is catalyzed by immune response gene 1 (IRG1), has excellent potential to link immunity and metabolism in activated macrophages through alkylation or competitive inhibition of target proteins. In support of this, our previous study demonstrated that the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) signaling platform functions as a hub in macrophage immunity and has a profound impact on the prognosis of sepsis. Interestingly, we found that itaconate, an endogenous immunomodulator, can significantly inhibit the activation of STING signaling. Moreover, 4-octyl itaconate (4-OI), which is a permeable itaconate derivative, could alkylate cysteine sites 65, 71, 88, and 147 of STING, thereby inhibiting its phosphorylation and downregulating the production of related inflammatory factors. Furthermore, itaconate and 4-OI inhibited the production of inflammatory factors in sepsis models. Our results have broadened the role of the IRG1-Itaconate axis in immunomodulation and highlighted itaconate and its derivatives as potential therapeutic agents in sepsis.</p>",

The preprocessing results generated a data matrix that consisted of the retention time (RT), mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) and peak intensity. For peak picking, the following parameters were used: centWave, m/z = 25 ppm, peakwidth = c(10,60), prefilter = c(10,100). For peak grouping, bw = 5, mzwid = 0.025, minfrac = 0.5 were used. In the extracted ion features, only the variables having more than 50% of the nonzero measurement values in at least one group were kept. X peaks are detected, and X metabolites can be left behind by interquartile range denoising methods. Then fill the missing values \u200b\u200bof the original data with half of the minimum value. In addition, an internal standard normalization method was employed in this data analysis. <strong>R</strong> package <strong>CAMERA</strong> was used for peak annotation after XCMS data processing.</p><p><br></p><p>The resulting three-dimensional data involving peak numbers, sample names and normalized peak areas were input into the <strong>SIMCA</strong> software package (V14.1, Sartorius Stedim Data Analytics AB, Umea, Sweden) for principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal pairs Predictive Discriminant Analysis of Latent Structures (OPLS-DA). PCA shows the distribution of the raw data. To obtain a higher level of group separation and a better understanding of the variables responsible for classification, supervised OPLS-DA was applied. After that, the classification parameters in the software are R2Y and Q2Y, which are stable and good for fitness and prediction. Seven-fold cross-validation was used to estimate the robustness and predictive power of our model. Permutation testing was performed to further validate the model. A low value of the Q2Y intercept indicates the robustness of the model, showing a low risk of overfitting and reliability.</p>",
