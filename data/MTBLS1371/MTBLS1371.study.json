                "description": "<h4><strong>BACKGROUND: </strong>The introduction of high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) testing as part of primary cervical screening is anticipated to improve sensitivity, but also the number of women who will screen positive. Reflex cytology is the preferred triage test in most settings but has limitations including moderate diagnostic accuracy, lack of automation, inter-observer variability and the need for clinician-collected sample. Novel, objective and cost-effective approaches are needed.</h4><h4><strong>METHODS: </strong>In this study, we assessed the potential use of an automated metabolomic robotic platform, employing the principle of laser-assisted Rapid Evaporative Ionisation Mass Spectrometry (LA-REIMS) in cervical cancer screening.</h4><h4><strong>FINDINGS: </strong>In a population of 130 women, LA-REIMS achieved 94% sensitivity and 83% specificity (AUC: 91.6%) in distinguishing women testing positive (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;65) or negative (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;65) for hrHPV. We performed further analysis according to disease severity with LA-REIMS achieving sensitivity and specificity of 91% and 73% respectively (AUC: 86.7%) in discriminating normal from high-grade pre-invasive disease.</h4><h4><strong>INTERPRETATION: </strong>This automated high-throughput technology holds promise as a low-cost and rapid test for cervical cancer screening and triage. The use of platforms like LA-REIMS has the potential to further improve the accuracy and efficiency of the current national screening programme.</h4><h4><strong>FUNDING: </strong>Work was funded by the MRC Imperial Confidence in Concept Scheme, Imperial College Healthcare Charity, British Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology, National Research Development and Innovation Office of Hungary, Waters corporation and NIHR BRC.</h4>",

The sample was collected without the use of lubrication and prior to the application of acetic acid or iodine. High-risk HPV (hrHPV) detection was performed on the collected samples to identify 14 hrHPV subtypes (16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 66 and 68) using clinically validated hrHPV assays.

A helium gas-cooled CO2 surgical laser (FELS-25A, OmniGuide, USA), with a fibre optic beam guide, wavelength of 10.6 \u03bcm and 30 psi gas pressure, was utilised with a power setting of 1.5 W in SuperPulse pulsatile mode with 40 ms pulse windows. The resulting analyte-containing vapour was transferred for mass spectrometry analysis through PTFE tubing to a Xevo G2-XS Q-ToF (Waters Corporation, UK) operated under conditions given in <strong>Table S1</strong> in the paper associated with this study. Prior to entry into the mass spectrometer, the generated vapour was mixed with 2-propanol containing leucine encephalin at a concentration of 0.1 ng/ml, at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. We performed quality control measurements by infusing continuously leucine enkephalin to 2-propanol ionisation matrix that was within an acceptable range; there was no significant difference between the compared groups based on HPV infection and disease severity (see <strong>Fig. S1</strong> in the paper associated with this study). The resulting mixture passed through the REIMS atmospheric interface chamber where solvent\u2212ion clusters collide with a heated (700-800 \u00b0C) coil before entry into the StepWave of the MS instrument<strong>[1]</strong> (see <strong>Fig. 2</strong> in the paper associated with this study).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Cameron SJS, Alexander JL, Bolt F, Burke A, Ashrafian H, Teare J, Marchesi JR, Kinross J, Li JV, Tak\u00e1ts Z.

                        "description": "<p>For the primary analysis, women were classified into 2 groups: hrHPV positive and negative. We used the resulting spectral data to explore whether LA-REIMS was able to distinguish women with and without a high-risk HPV infection. We calculated accuracy parameters that included sensitivity, specificity and the area under the curve (AUC). Furthermore, we performed additional analysis to explore whether the LA-REIMS had the ability to discriminate women without precancerous changes (normal/HPV) from women with clinically significant disease (CIN2 or worse). We chose this comparison as the most clinically relevant outcome for our main analysis. We performed a series of secondary analysis exploring different comparisons and calculated accuracy parameters for different comparisons. We performed further subgroup analyses using as gold standard histology alone. Finally, we explored the accuracy of LA-REIMS in discriminating normal/HPV from CIN2 or worse as per the main analysis but restricting these to hrHPV positive women in an attempt to mimic the current screening algorithms that uses cytology as a reflex test.</p><p><br></p><p>We used histology in preference to cytology to define the disease grade. If histology was present from a punch biopsy and a cone documenting different grade, the most severe lesion was considered. If histology was not available as not clinically indicated (negative or borderline cytology), cytology was used for classification. Cytological and histological assessments were performed by experienced cytopathologists.</p><p><br></p><p>To assess whether there were any potential baseline differences in selected clinical and demographic characteristics, we performed statistical analysis using IBM SPSS Statistics (version 26). P values were calculated using a t-test or 1-way ANOVA test for the age and a Fisher's exact test for hrHPV status, disease status, ethnicity, parity, smoking, contraception and menopause. A P value &lt; 0.05 was considered significant.</p><p><br></p><p>After mass spectrometric acquisition, all raw spectral data underwent pre-processing with the Offline Model Builder (OMB) software (version 1.1.29.0, Waters) to perform background subtraction and mass drift correction against leucine encephalin lock mass compound (negative ionisation mode m/z = 554.2615). Following background subtraction and lockmass correction, spectra were normalised based on total ion count and re-binned to 0.1 Da within the 50 to 1200 m/z range. After pre-processing of the mass spectra with the OMB software, filtering for signal-to-noise ratios was completed to identify samples with insufficient cellular material for analysis. This was completed by calculating the average for each of the top 10 most intense features in the mass spectra and identifying those samples that were below a single standard deviation in at least 3 of the features. After sample filtering, a data matrix was exported and uploaded on the <strong>MetaboAnalyst 4.0 online platform[1]</strong>, where additional processing was performed for data filtering (mean intensity value), log transformation and Pareto Scaling (mean-centred and divided by the square root of the standard deviation of each variable) prior multivariate analysis. Spectra were further interrogated within the 600\u20131000 m/z range.</p><p><br></p><p>Random forest algorithms were used as a machine learning approach for sample classification and evaluation of the technique's performance. Random forest models allow prediction of unknown samples (i.e. test dataset) after training on a known dataset (i.e. train dataset). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated by Monte-Carlo cross validation (MCCV) using balanced sub-sampling. This method is a cross validation approach which creates multiple random splits of the dataset into training and validation data<strong>[2]</strong>. For each split, the model is fit to the training data and predictive accuracy is assessed using the validation data. The results are then averaged over the splits. In each MCCV, two thirds (2/3) of the samples were used as the training dataset and the performance of the model was then validated on the 1 third (1/3) of the samples that were left out, used as the test dataset<strong>[3]</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Chong J, Soufan O, Li C, Caraus I, Li S, Bourque G, Wishart DS, Xia J.
