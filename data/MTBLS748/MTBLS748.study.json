                "description": "Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) encompasses a spectrum of inherited disorders that lead to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). There is no cure for PKD and current treatment options are limited to renal replacement therapy and transplantation. A better understanding of the pathobiology of PKD is needed for the development of new, less invasive treatments. The Lewis Polycystic Kidney (LPK) rat phenotype has been characterized and classified as a model of nephronophthisis (NPHP9, caused by mutation of the Nek8 gene) for which polycystic kidneys are one of the main pathologic features. The aim of this study was to use a GC-MS-based untargeted metabolomics approach to determine key biochemical changes in kidney and liver tissue of the LPK rat. Tissues from 16-week old LPK (n\u202f=\u202f10) and Lewis age- and sex-matched control animals (n\u202f=\u202f11) were used. Principal component analysis (PCA) distinguished signal corrected metabolite profiles from Lewis and LPK rats for kidney (PC-1 77%) and liver (PC-1 46%) tissue. There were marked differences in the metabolite profiles of the kidney tissues with 122 deconvoluted features significantly different between the LPK and Lewis strains. The metabolite profiles were less marked between strains for liver samples with 30 features significantly different. Five biochemical pathways showed three or more significantly altered metabolites: transcription/translation, arginine and proline metabolism, alpha-linolenic and linoleic acid metabolism, the citric acid cycle, and the urea cycle. The results of this study validate and complement the current literature and are consistent with the understood pathobiology of PKD.",

Once dry, the organ dry weight was recorded. After the removal of any visible adipose tissue (fat pad), the organs were ground using a mortar and pestle. Approximately 5 mg of tissue was weighed into a Precellys soft tissue homogenization tube (2 ml; beads removed; Bertin Instruments, Montigny-le-Bretonneux, France) and the weight recorded (\u00b1 0.00001 g). Ceramic beads were returned to the tubes after weighing the sample.</p><p><br></p><p>Samples were milled using a Precellys homogenizer (Bertin Instruments, Montigny-le-Bretonneux, France) for 20 s at 6500 rpm, returned to dry ice and then milled a second time for 20 s at 6500 rpm. At this point, samples were either \u2018paste-like\u2019 or a very&nbsp;fine powder. LC-MS grade methanol (500 \u03bcl) was added to the milled sample which was then returned to the homogenizer for a further 2 runs of 20 s at 6500 rpm. Samples were agitated (Eppendorf Thermomixer Comfort; Eppendorf South Pacific Pty Ltd, North Ryde, NSW, Australia) at 1200 rpm for 5 min. Samples were then centrifuged (Eppendorf 5415R centrifuge; Eppendorf South Pacific Pty Ltd, North Ryde, NSW, Australia) at 16,100 x g at 4 \u00b0C for 5 min. The supernatant was transferred to a fresh 2 ml tube and stored on dry ice. The methanol extraction procedure was repeated on the tissue sample and supernatants combined. LC-MS grade water (300 \u03bcl) containing the uniformly labelled internal standard (IS; 13C6-sorbitol; 3.25 \u03bcg/ml) to assess extraction, derivatization and instrument performance was then added to the tissue sample and the extraction procedure was repeated for a third time. Samples were maintained on dry ice at all times possible throughout the extraction procedure. After an overnight \u2018freeze-out\u2019 at -80 \u00b0C, the combined extract was centrifuged (16,100 x g at 4 \u00b0C for 5 min) and the resulting supernatant was transferred to a clean tube. The methanol was evaporated from the extract in an Eppendorf Concentrator Plus rotary vacuum concentrator. LC-MS grade water (400 \u03bcl) was added to the extracts, which were then frozen on dry ice before freeze-drying overnight. Dried extracts were stored at -80 \u00b0C until derivatization and analysis.</p><p><br></p><p>Dry metabolites were treated with 40 \u03bcl methoxyamine-HCl (20 mg/ml in pyridine) and mixed for 90 min at 1200 rpm and 30 \u00b0C in the Thermomixer. Following methoximation, metabolites were treated with 80 \u03bcl MSTFA and mixed for 30 min at 300 rpm and 37 \u00b0C. The derivatized mixture was transferred to a GC vial containing 10 \u03bcl of an alkane mix in hexane (C10, C12, C15, C19, C22, C28; 0.156 mg/ml; C32, C36; 0.313 mg/ml).</p><p><br></p>",

The derivatized sample (1 \u03bcl) was injected in splitless mode into the inlet at a temperature of 230 \u00b0C. The initial column temperature was set to 70 \u00b0C. A temperature ramp of 1 \u00b0C/min for 5 min followed by a temperature ramp of 5.63 \u00b0C/min to a&nbsp;final temperature of 330 \u00b0C with a hold time of 10 min was used.

Peak detection parameter settings are tabulated in <strong>Table SI1</strong> in the paper associated with this study. A script written in Ruby programming language was used for alignment of common chromatographic peaks as previously described<strong>[1][2]</strong>. For kidney tissue samples, metabolites which occurred in at least 17 of 21 replicates (&gt; 80%) or all replicates of 1 strain and none of the other were considered. For liver tissue samples, metabolites which occurred in at least 15 of 19 replicates (&gt; 78%) were considered. For kidney and liver tissue, missing values were replaced with the lowest recorded peak area for the strain. In the first instance, peak area was scaled to the sample weight (mg dry weight) and transformed (x = log10[x + 1]) and in the second instance to the sample weight and internal standard, and log10-transformed (as above; see result <strong>Section 3.2</strong> in the paper associated with this study). Data matrices are provided in <strong>Files SI2</strong> and <strong>SI3</strong> in the paper associated with this study. <strong>Principal component analyses (PCA)</strong> were conducted using <strong>The Unscrambler X v10.1</strong> (CAMO, Oslo, Norway). Data were mean centered, cross validated using the <strong>non-linear iterative partial least squares (NIPALS)</strong> approach and 7 components were generated.</p><p><br></p><p>Log-scaled peak area of the IS for kidney and liver experiments was assessed for strain effects using the <strong>Mann-Whitney U tes</strong>t and correlation between the IS and the TIC; and IS and the sum of peak areas in the final peak table was assessed using <strong>Spearman's Rho</strong> (SPSS v22.0, IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) All other data were assessed for statistical significance using the <strong>MATLAB scripting language</strong> (v2017b, MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA). Independent <strong>t-tests</strong> assuming unequal variance were conducted on a per-compound basis to determine the effect of strain on metabolites and the <strong>Benjamini-Hochberg[3]</strong> false discovery rate correction was used. Uncorrected (<strong>p-values</strong>) and corrected (<strong>q-values</strong>) are reported. A <strong>p &lt; 0.05</strong> threshold for statistical significance and 95% confidence interval were employed for <strong>Mann-Whitney</strong> and <strong>t-tests</strong> and values were expressed as means \u00b11 SD throughout.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Abbiss H, Rawlinson C, Maker GL, Trengove RD.
