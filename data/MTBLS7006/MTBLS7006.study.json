                "description": "<p>Apicomplexan parasite growth and replication relies on nutrient acquisition from host cells, in which intracellular multiplication occurs, yet the mechanisms that underlie the nutrient salvage remain elusive. Numerous ultrastructural studies have documented a plasma membrane invagination with a dense neck, termed the micropore, on the surface of intracellular parasites. However, the function of this structure remains unknown. Here we validate the micropore as an essential organelle for endocytosis of nutrients from the host cell cytosol and Golgi in the model apicomplexan <em>Toxoplasma gondii</em>. Detailed analyses demonstrated that Kelch13 is localized at the dense neck of the organelle and functions as a protein hub at the micropore for endocytic uptake. Intriguingly, maximal activity of the micropore requires the ceramide de novo synthesis pathway in the parasite. Thus, this study provides insights into the machinery underlying acquisition of host cell-derived nutrients by apicomplexan parasites that are otherwise sequestered from host cell compartments.</p>",

                        "description": "<p><strong>Parasite and host cell culture</strong></p><p>The previously described lines RH\u0394ku80\u0394hxgprt<strong>[1]</strong> and RH\u0394ku80\u0394hxgprt/TIR1<strong>[2]</strong>, referred to as RHku80and TIR1, were used to generate the transgenic lines (T. gondii tachyzoites) reported here. The parental lines and derived lines (<strong>Data S1</strong>&nbsp;in the paper associated with this study) were grown in human foreskin fibroblasts HFF-1 (ATCC SCRC-1041) in D5 media composed of Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) (12800-082, Thermo Fisher Scientific), supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (10099-141, Gibco), 2\u2009mM glutamine (G0200, Solarbio Biotech) and 100 units penicillin-streptomycin (P1410, Solarbio Biotech) at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2. HFF-1 cells were cultured in the same media and conditions, and were all maintained as mycoplasma negative<strong>[3]</strong>. The TIR1 parental line, and their derived AID lines were cultured in HFF monolayers with 500\u2009mM auxin (I2886, Sigma-Aldrich) (+IAA) or 0.1% ethanol alone (\u2212IAA) for phenotypic assays, as previously described<strong>[2][4]</strong>. Parasites were allowed to naturally egress or were mechanically lysed by passing through 22\u2009g needles, and harvested by filtration through 3.0 \u00b5m polycarbonate membranes, from which extracellular parasites were used for experimental assays.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Plasmid design and construction</strong></p><p>All plasmids (<strong>Data S2</strong>) were generated by a Basic Seamless Cloning and Assembly kit (CU201-02, TransGen Biotech) using existing plasmids as templates. Briefly, the pCas9-sgRNA plasmids were generated using a previously described plasmid (Addgene 54467) as the template, and 3 fragments were amplified using 3 pairs of primers named as Cas9-F1/R1, Cas9-sgRNA xx/Cas9-R2 and Cas9-F2/R3 (<strong>Data S3</strong>). The Cas9-sgRNA xx primer contains the sgRNA sequences (20 mer) which target a specific locus either upstream of the start codon (pCas9-sgRNA 5\u2019) or downstream of the stop codon (pCas9-sgRNA 3\u2019). The sgRNA design was selected from the prediction webpage<strong>[5]</strong>. The generic plasmids used for the amplicons targeting at the C-terminus of a gene were generated previously<strong>[4]</strong>, such as pLinker-AID-3xHA-DHFR (addgene 86669), pLinker-AID-Ty-HXGPRT (addgene 86667) and pLinker-AID-3xHA-HXGPRT (addgene 86553), or generated in this study by cloning the fragment of AID-Ty or TurboID-Ty (amplified from addgene 1116904) into the backbone of pLinker-AID-3xHA-DHFR, producing pLinker-AID-Ty-DHFR and pLinker-TurboID-Ty-DHFR. The generic plasmids used for the amplicons targeting at the N-terminus of a gene were generated using the backbone of a plasmid named pN-Ty-DHFR or pN-Ty-HXGPRT<strong>[6]</strong>, by replacement of the Ty region with Ty-TurboID, Ty-AID, HA-AID, C-myc-AID, 6HA or 6Ty. Primers used for the plasmid generation were listed for each plasmid in <strong>Data S3</strong> and plasmids generated in this study were listed in <strong>Data S2</strong>. The DNA regions, including epitopes, AID and TurboID in the newly prepared plasmids were checked by DNA sequencing. The plasmid for complementation of the Ty-AID- Kelch13 line was generated by cloning the Kelch13 fragment into pN-Ty-HXGPRT to replace the Ty region and was generated using primers listed in <strong>Data S3</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Generation of T. gondii lines</strong></p><p>CRISPR-Cas9 tagging technology was used for generation of all lines (<strong>Data S1</strong>) that contain endogenous fusions at the C-terminus of proteins, and at the N-terminus of proteins in the parental lines of the RHku80KO or TIR1 line<strong>[4]</strong>. In brief, the CRISPR/Cas9 sgRNA 3\u2019 plasmids (<strong>Data S2</strong>) and CRISPR/Cas9 sgRNA 5\u2019 plasmids (<strong>Data S2</strong>) can efficiently produce Cas9 and sgRNA to create DNA double strand breaks (DSB) in parasites, and facilitates the integration of a tagging amplicon. The amplicon for the C-terminal tagging was generated from a generic plasmid (with the name pLinker-) containing a tag (6HA, AID-3xHA, AID-3Ty, 6Ty or TurboID-3Ty, etc) as described above, using a pair of primers L and T (<strong>Data S3</strong>). The amplicon for the N-terminal tagging was generated from a generic tagging plasmid (with the name pN-) containing a tag (Ty-TurboID, Ty-AID, HA-AID, myc-AID) using a pair of primers M and NL. The amplicon was then combined with the corresponding CRISPR/Cas9 sgRNA 3\u2019 or 5\u2019 plasmid (<strong>Data S2</strong>) and transfected into recipient lines. The drug selection was followed on the second day based on the resistance marker used in the amplicons. The resistance markers with LoxP sites were excised by transfection with pmini-Cre<strong>[7]</strong>. The cpl gene in the TIR1-AID lines was deleted using a similar CRISPR-Cas9 strategy<strong>[3]</strong>. The complementation lines were generated by direct transfection with the plasmids containing the wild type gene (<strong>Data S2</strong>). Transfection and drug selection were performed with 25\u2009\u03bcg/mL mycophenolic acid (M5255, Sigma-Aldrich) and 25\u2009\u03bcg/mL 6-xanthine (X4002, Sigma-Aldrich), 200\u2009\u03bcg/mL 6-thioxanthine (S96242, Shanghai Yuanye Biotech), or 3\u2009\u03bcM pyrimethamine (46706, Sigma-Aldrich)<strong>[4][6]</strong>. The lines were confirmed by IFA and diagnostic PCR, as illustrated in <strong>Figure S3a/S3b</strong>, and the PCR was designed for testing the integration site and the endogenous region with primers listed in <strong>Data S3</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Huynh MH, Carruthers VB.

In <strong>CAMERA</strong> package, the annotations of isotope peak, adducts and fragments were performed with default parameters. The final data was exported as a peak table file, including sample names, variables (rt_mz) and peak areas. The peak areas data was normalized to internal standards before the statistical analysis. The in-house database was referenced to identify the compound by using m/z (MS1), mass spectra (MS2) and retention times (RT). Normalization for relative parasite amounts was based on the total integrated peak area values of metabolites within an experimental batch.
