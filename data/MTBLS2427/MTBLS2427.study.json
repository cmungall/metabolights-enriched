                "description": "Sweat is emerging as a prominent biosource for real-time human performance monitoring applications. Although promising, sources of variability must be identified to truly utilize sweat for biomarker applications. In this proof-of-concept study, a targeted metabolomics method was applied to sweat collected from the forearms of participants in a 12-week exercise program who ingested either low or high nutritional supplementation twice daily. The data establish the use of dried powder mass as a method for metabolomic data normalization from sweat samples. Additionally, the results support the hypothesis that ingestion of regular nutritional supplementation semi-quantitatively impact the sweat metabolome. For example, a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of relative normalized metabolite quantities show an area under the curve of 0.82 suggesting the sweat metabolome can moderately predict if an individual is taking nutritional supplementation. Finally, a significant correlation between physical performance and the sweat metabolome are established. For instance, the data illustrate that by utilizing multiple linear regression modeling approaches, sweat metabolite quantities can predict VO<sub>2</sub> max (<i>p</i> = 0.0346), peak lower body Windage (<i>p</i> = 0.0112), and abdominal circumference (<i>p</i> = 0.0425). The results illustrate the need to account for dietary nutrition in biomarker discovery applications involving sweat as a biosource.",

                        "description": "<p>All volunteer human subjects (n=13) were male members of the United States Air Force of variable age (19-35) and rank stationed at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (AFB) in Dayton, Ohio, USA. Permission to perform human subjects research was obtained, prior to the study's start, from the Wright-Patterson AFB Institutional Review Board (IRB  FWR20150032H). Volunteers were informed of the protocol and permitted to ask questions, then provided informed written consent to participate.</p><p><br></p><p>Participants' sweat was sampled during an ongoing physical fitness and nutritional intervention study within the Air Force Research Laboratory<strong>[1]</strong>. Prior to (Pre) and following (Post) the 12-week fitness program, physical performance was evaluated by measuring weight, VO2 max, resting heart rate (HR), abdominal circumference (Ab Circ), %body fat, push-ups, sit-ups, and upper body (UBW) and lower body Wingate (LBW) testing as outlined previously<strong>[1]</strong>. Additionally, as part of the previous experiment<strong>[1]</strong>, volunteers were provided a twice daily (7 days a week for 12 weeks), orally ingested, liquid high nutritional dietary supplementation (n=7) or low nutritional supplementation (n=6) drink. Finally, study participants performed programmed daily (Monday through Friday) strength training and/or cardiovascular exercise routines over the 12-week period. See <strong>Data S1</strong>, <strong>S2</strong>, and <strong>S3</strong> in the paper associated with this study for additional information regarding the experiment design, physical performance evaluation results, and participant exercise information.</p><p><br></p><p>Sweat was collected from forearms of participants performing their routine cardio workout on either a stationary bike, elliptical, or treadmill, as part of the larger previous experiment<strong>[1]</strong>, on weeks 1, 5, 6, or 7, and week 12 (see <strong>Data S1</strong> in the paper associated with this study). Week 5, 6, or 7 was used as a mid-point collection due to less than 100% attendance among participants. The temperature and humidity (%RH) within the exercise laboratory was measured during collection with a Kestrel 4500NV weather tracker (Temperature: 22.2 \u00b1 1.3 \u00baC, %RH: 0.2%, see <strong>Data S4</strong> in the paper associated with this study). Percent max heart rate (%maxHR), determined during a prior VO2 max test was utilized to regulate intensity among workouts (Parvo Medics, Sandy, UT, USA). Workouts consisted of periods of variable %maxHR over a 22-min exercise program. Please see <strong>Data S3</strong> in the paper associated with this study, for a summary of the exercise protocols, exercises performed, and training loads from exercises.</p><p><br></p><p>Sweat was collected via a forearm patch, as described previously<strong>[2][3]</strong>. Briefly, both forearms at the inner side of the arm between the elbow and wrist with minimal hair were wiped thoroughly with a brand new 2-propanol wipe (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA). Following, each forearm was rinsed for 5-10 s with tap water and allowed to air dry. As previously described<strong>[3]</strong>, a modified patch was applied to the center, estimated as the hairless area approximately at the middle between the elbow and wrist, of the dried forearm. </p><p><br></p><p>Immediately at the conclusion of the exercise, free sweat within the patch was aspirated with a 5 ml syringe and needle, blunt tipped (needle and syringe, Hamilton, Reno, NV, USA). The aspirate was placed in the top of a 0.1 \u03bcm polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) centrifugal filter, 1 filter per arm (Ultrafree-CL PVDF filter, Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA). Additionally, the nylon piece from the collection pouch was added to the corresponding arm's centrifugal filter, using forceps, and both filters were spun at 3,000 x g for 10 min. The filtrates, from both arms were pooled together. A 100 \u03bcl aliquot and a 20 \u03bcl aliquot of the pooled filtered sweat were made to perform sweat pH and chloride measurements, as described in the next sections. Additionally, a 250 \u03bcl aliquot of the combined filtered sweat was placed into a dried, pre-weighed lo-bind Eppendorf tube and frozen on liquid nitrogen (balance, Mettler Toledo, Columbus, Ohio, USA, Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). Aliquots were lyophilized to dryness, reweighed, and stored at -80 \u00baC until use (Labconco, Kansas City, MO, USA). The mass of the dried sweat was determined by subtracting the dried sweat mass from the dried empty tube mass. Please see <strong>Data S5</strong> in the paper associated with this study, for the determined dried sweat masses.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Zwilling CE, Strang A, Anderson E, Jurcsisn J, Johnson E, Das T, Kuchan MJ, Barbey AK.

                        "description": "<p>Calibration curves for 23 compounds previously identified in human sweat, were generated in Resuspension Buffer across various ranges (5 and 300 \u03bcM)<strong>[1]-[9]</strong>. Calibration curves were analyzed, in increasing concentration, by LC-MS at the beginning, middle, and end of the overall sample analyses, as described in the following section. Peak areas and retention times for each compound, including the isotopically labeled compounds, were determined using the Tracefinder EFS software package (v. 3.2, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Calibration curves were created for each individual compound by plotting theoretical concentration, in \u03bcM, on the x-axis and the unlabeled/isotopically labeled peak area ratio of all calibrant injections on the y-axis. A line of best fit was fit to the data and an equation of the line was generated (Prism Graphpad Software, v. 9.0, La Jolla, CA, USA). For those compounds where an isotopically labeled version of the compound were unavailable, raw peak areas of all calibrant injections were plotted on the y-axis rather than the unlabeled/isotopically labeled peak area ratios. Please see <strong>Data S7</strong> in the paper associated with this study, for individual compound: quantitative ion, calibration ranges, line of best fit equation, and R2 value of the best fit line. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Liappis N, Kelderbacher SD, Kesseler K, Bantzer P.
