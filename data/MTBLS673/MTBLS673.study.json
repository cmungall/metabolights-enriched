                "description": "<p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> The ultra-high density intensive farming model of grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idellus) may elicit inhibite the growth, decline flesh quality and disease resistance of fish. The quality degradation and excessive fat accumulation in cultured C. idellus have long been attributed to possible alterations in the lipid metabolism of fish muscle tissues as a result of over-nutrition from artificial diets. To investigate the effects of different diets on fish muscle quality, a large-scale metabolomics study was performed on 200 tails of C. idellus. </p><p><strong>FINDINGS:</strong> The experimental fish were divided into four test groups based on sex and diets - female artificial feed (FAF), female grass feed (FGF), male artificial feed (MAF) and male grass feed (MGF). After a 4-month rearing period, the AF group showed significantly higher total mass of muscle fat (P &lt; 0.01), with the FAF group being the highest. Metabolomics profiling based on liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) revealed distinctive patterns of clustering according to the four groups. Overall, artificial feeding was associated with higher concentrations of docosapentaenoic acid (DPA), dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA) and arachidonic acid (ARA); whereas grass-feeding was associated with elevated n-3 unsaturated fatty acids (n-3 UFAs), such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) and gamma-linolenic acid (GLA). Some sex-specific markers, such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) was only found in male samples, with higher levels in the MAF group. Metabolic pathway analyses using both targeted (MetaboAnalyst) and untargeted (mummichog) approaches consistently revealed that the arachidonic acid metabolism and steroid hormone biosynthesis pathways are significantly different between AF and GF groups. </p><p><strong>CONCLUSIONS:</strong> Our results suggested that grass is a better source of diet fatty acid and protein when compared to artificial feed, because it could effectively lower triglycerides in serum, reduce fat accumulation and alter lipid compositions in fish muscle by increasing the concentrations of n-3 UFAs, leading to better nutrition and health.</p>",

White muscle and gonadal tissues were taken from 250 tails per experimental group (AF/GF).\n</p>\nGonads were stained routinely with hematoxylin and eosin. The sex of the grass carp was determined by the contour of the gonad and further results of the gonad tissue slice.\n</p>\nBased on the results of the sex determination, metabolomic analysis of muscle samples were divided into 4 test groups (n = 10): female fish of the grass feeding group (FGF), male fish of the grass feeding group (MGF), female fish of the artificial diet group (FAF), as well as male fish of the artificial diet group (MAF).",

The TOF mass scan range of both simultaneous low- and high-energy mass scan functions was from 50 m/z to 1200 m/z with a scan time 0.2 s. For the MS/MS detection, all precursors were fragmented using 20 - 40 eV. During the acquisition, the mass spectrometry signal was acquired every 3 s to calibrate the mass accuracy.",

First, data were cropped to remove external standards. Masses were detected, and the chromatogram for each mass was built using the Centroid mass detector and Chromatogram builder, respectively. Smoothed data were then deconvoluted using a noise amplitude algorithm and deisotoped. The conditions for chromatographic alignment were 0.01 m/z tolerance and 0.1 min RT-tolerance. Finally, sodium and ammonium adducts search was performed prior to exporting the data to Excel for post-processing. The compound identification list, which contained the molecular weight, compound name, statistical scores, and other information to show the result of the identifications was exported as an excel file (.csv).\n</p>\nTo verify and confirm compound identifications, the METLIN batch Metabolite Search Database (http://metlin.scripps.edu/), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/), Human Metabolite Database (http://www.hmdb.ca/) and ChemSpider (http://www.chemspider.com/) databases were used by comparing molecular weights and MOL files. The molecular and structural formulas of the candidate compounds were retrieved by the comparison and then confirmed by MS/MS scans for the characteristic ions and fragmentation patterns of the metabolites.",
