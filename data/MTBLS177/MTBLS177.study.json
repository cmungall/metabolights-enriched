                "description": "Genomic instability is one of the hallmarks of cancer. Several chemotherapeutic drugs and radiotherapy induce DNA damage to prevent cancer cell replication. Cells in turn activate different DNA damage response (DDR) pathways to either repair the damage or induce cell death. These DDR pathways also elicit metabolic alterations which can play a significant role in the proper functioning of the cells. The understanding of these metabolic effects resulting from different types of DNA damage and repair mechanisms is currently lacking. In this study, we used NMR metabolomics to identify metabolic pathways which are altered in response to different DNA damaging agents. By comparing the metabolic responses in MCF-7 cells, we identified the activation of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) in methyl methanesulfonate (MMS)-induced DNA damage. PARP activation led to a significant depletion of NAD+. PARP inhibition using veliparib (ABT-888) was able to successfully restore the NAD+ levels in MMS-treated cells. In addition, double strand break induction by MMS and veliparib exhibited similar metabolic responses as zeocin, suggesting an application of metabolomics to classify the types of DNA damage responses. This prediction was validated by studying the metabolic responses elicited by radiation. Our findings indicate that cancer cell metabolic responses depend on the type of DNA damage responses and can also be used to classify the type of DNA damage.",

Cells were treated with DNA damaging agents: cisplatin (Biotang Inc.), methyl methane sulfonate (Acros Organics), zeocin (Invivogen) or a phosphate buffered saline (PBS, Invitrogen) control for 24 h (or 1 h in the case of MMS followed by 23 h of recovery due to rapid DNA damage induction in the case of MMS due to a higher rate of interaction with the DNA as compared to other drugs) before harvesting. Cells were treated with the PARP inhibitor veliparib (ABT-888) (Selleckchem) or PBS containing DMSO (1 lg/ml) 24 h prior to other drug treatments. Stock solution for all drugs, except for veliparib which was in DMSO, were prepared in PBS. All experiments were performed in three independent, biological replicates.\n</p>\nTo identify appropriate dosage of radiation treatment, MCF-7 cells were seeded in 6 well plates and after reaching subconfluency, cells were irradiated with 137Cs source (J. L. Sheppard Mark I unit) at a dose rate of 221 rad/min with a total dose of 4, 8 or 12 Gy and the cell growth over the next 2 days was calculated using hemocytometer. 8 Gy treatment for 48 h led to a ~80% survival and the samples were collected for NMR analysis.",

                        "description": "The cells were quenched using 3 ml methanol using the protocol described previously [1]. Briefly, the culture medium was aspirated and the cells were immediately rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS (pH 7.4). The residual PBS was removed using vacuum aspiration and the cells were quenched using 3 ml HPLC grade methanol (Sigma-Aldrich). The cells were then detached using a cell scraper and pipetted into 50 ml centrifuge tube. A dual phase extraction procedure detailed previously [2] was used to extract the intracellular metabolites. Briefly, the quenched cells suspended in a mixture of chloroform, methanol and water in the ratio of 6:6:5.4 to make the final volume of 17.4 ml. The aqueous layer (top) contains the water-soluble low-molecular weight metabolites while the organic layer (bottom) contains non-polar metabolites. Proteins and other macromolecules are precipitated by addition of methanol and chloroform and trapped between the aqueous and organic layer. After centrifugation for 15 min at 3600 rpm, only the upper aqueous layer was used for further analysis. The samples were dried at 30 \u00baC using a centrifugal vacuum concentrator and stored in -80 \u00baC until NMR analysis.\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Teng et al.
