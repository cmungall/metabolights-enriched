Specific gut microbes are associated with susceptibility to gallstone diseases,while the relationship between intestinal flora and liver metabolism in the formation of gallstones remains unclear. C57BL/6J male mice received a dietary intervention for 8 weeks, with a lithogenic diet given to the test group and a normal diet to the control group. An integrated 16S rRNA gene sequencing and LC/MS-based nontargeted metabolomics approach was performed to explore the impact of the lithogenic diet on the intestinal flora and liver metabolic phenotype, and Spearman correlation analysis established a network between the gut and liver.&nbsp;</p>",

Each group was fed the indicated diet and water <em>ad libitum</em>. The mice were given 1 wk to adapt to the new environment, followed by 8 wks of dietary intervention. 20 mice were randomly divided into the <strong>control </strong>group (C group) fed with <strong>normal diet</strong>, the <strong>test </strong>group (T group) fed a <strong>lithogenic diet</strong> (LD, containing 1.25% cholesterol and 0.5% cholic acid). After the 8 wks dietary intervention, the mouse faeces were collected on ice in individual sterile microcentrifuge tubes, which were taken to the laboratory on an ice pack within 1 h of collection and rapidly stored in a -80 \u00b0C freezer for further study. Mice were sacrificed after an 8 h fast. To reduce the influences of the postmortem delay on the liver metabolites, all samples were collected and frozen at -80 \u00b0C within 10 min after death.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>",

LEfSe differences between 2 groups were tested for significance using the Kruskal-Wallis sum-rank test, and biological significance was subsequently investigated using a set of pairwise tests among groups using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Finally, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was used to obtain the final differential species, followed by the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. The predicted <strong>KEGG </strong>database (<a href='http://www.genome.jp/kegg' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>http://www.genome.jp/kegg</a>) results will be counted at 3 levels according to the Wilcoxon algorithm. Multivariate statistical analysis will first use unsupervised principal component analysis (PCA) to observe the population distribution among samples and the stability of the whole analysis process, and then use orthogonal partial least squares analysis (OPLS-DA) to distinguish the overall differences in metabolic profiles among groups and find the metabolites that are different between groups. In this study, the default 7 round cross validation was applied with 1 /7th of the samples being excluded from the mathematical model in each round, in order to guard against overfitting. The screening standard of differential metabolites was that the first principal component in OPLS-DA model VIP\uff1e1, T test p\uff1c0.05. Pathway enrichment analysis of differential metabolites was performed by using the <strong>KEGG </strong>database.
