                "description": "<p><strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong> Cholesterol gallstone (CGS) is a biliary tract disorder requiring treatment in approximately 20% of patients. The efficacy of Chaihu Shugan in preventing CGS recurrence after successful treatment remains uncertain.</p><p><strong>METHODS:</strong> We examined the <em>in vivo</em> preventive efficacy of Chaihu Shugan using a CGS mouse model and used multi-omics to study the interplay between gut microbiota, metabolism and gene expression.</p><p><strong>RESULTS:</strong> The intestinal microbiota was severely dysregulated during the formation of CGS, showing a marked decrease in the abundance of beneficial microbiota, especially <em>Lactobacillus</em> and <em>Akkermansia</em>. Chaihu Shugan prevented CGS formation by restoring the composition of the gut microbiota and reversing the metabolic disturbances caused by dysbiosis. This preventive effect of Chaihu Shugan was paralleled by changes in the expression of metabolism-related genes in the liver. A network pharmacology analysis of Chaihu Shugan revealed that obacunone may be the key active metabolite in regulating bile acid metabolism. Multi-omics and correlation analyses elucidated the interplay between gut microbiota, metabolism and gene alterations in the dosedependent effect of Chaihu Shugan.</p><p><strong>CONCLUSION:</strong> Our data show that Chaihu Shugan can prevent CGS and indicate its mechanisms of action.</p>",

The different botanical drugs that constitute Chaihu Shugan were purchased from Jiangyin Tianjiang Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd (Jiangyin, China) and authenticated by two experienced pharmacists.</p><p><br></p><p>The extraction procedure abide by the type A extract of the ConPhyMP-Guidelines<strong>[1]</strong>. The botanical drug was boiled with water, filtered and concentrated into clear paste. Appropriate amount of auxiliary materials was added, dried, crushed and mixed well. Take the above extracts as prescribed and mix them evenly, and 12-40 mesh granules were prepared by the dry method. Check the solubility, moisture and microbial limits according to the inspection routine items. Pack the pellets into small foil bags into 5 g per package, and stored at room temperature. The botanical drugs were dissolved in normal saline before oral gavage.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Cholesterol gallstone mouse model</strong></p><p>The CGS model was established using 6-week-old C57BL/6 mice. The mice were divided into the CGS model (S), treatment (low-dose, L; medium-dose, M; high-dose, H) and control (C) groups (n = 10 mice per group). The mice were housed in a temperature-controlled room set at 22 \u00b1 2 \u00b0C, with a 12-h light/dark cycle (6 AM - 6 PM). A minimum acclimation period of 2 weeks was allowed before commencing the study. Throughout the experimental period, the mice had unrestricted access to water and were fed either normal mouse chow or a lithogenic diet. Specifically, the CGS group received a diet consisting of high levels of cholesterol and fat (10% lipid, 1% cholesterol and 0.5% cholate; TP 06116F1, Trophic Animal Feed High-tech Co. Ltd., Nantong, China), and the control group was fed a standard diet (LAD0011). The treatment groups were administered a high-cholesterol and high-fat diet and varying doses of Chaihu Shugan (low, medium and high) via oral gavage. The equivalent dose was calculated based on the body surface area. The mice (20 g) equivalent dose was 0.00162 x human (60 kg) equivalent dose, equal to 0.81 g/kg<strong>[2]</strong>. The three-dose gradients were 0.1, 0.5 and 1x mice equivalent dose (low, medium and high doses, respectively). Serum and fecal samples were collected at regular intervals every 2 weeks until the 8th week, when the mice were euthanized and their livers were collected for RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). The CGS model grade was assessed using phase contrast and polarized light microscopy images of cholesterol crystallization in the gallbladder bile. The CGS grade was also determined based on staging criteria used previously<strong>[3][4]</strong>, categorizing CGS from Grades 0 (no gallstones) to V.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Heinrich M, Jalil B, Abdel-Tawab M, Echeverria J, Kuli\u0107 \u017d, McGaw LJ, Pezzuto JM, Potterat O, Wang JB.
