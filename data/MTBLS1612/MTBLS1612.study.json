                "description": "<p>Aneuploidy causes system-wide disruptions in the stochiometric balances of transcripts, proteins, and metabolites, often resulting in detrimental effects for the organism. The protozoan parasite Leishmania has an unusually high tolerance for aneuploidy, but the molecular and functional consequences for the pathogen remain poorly understood. Here, we addressed this question in vitro and present the first integrated analysis of the genome, transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome of highly aneuploid Leishmania donovani strains. Our analyses unambiguously establish that aneuploidy in Leishmania proportionally impacts the average transcript- and protein abundance levels of affected chromosomes, ultimately correlating with the degree of metabolic differences between strains. This proportionality was present in both proliferative and non-proliferative in vitro promastigotes. However, protein complex subunits and non-cytoplasmic proteins, showed dosage compensation, responding less or even not at all to aneuploidy-induced dosage changes. In contrast to other Eukaryotes, we did not observe the widespread regulation at the transcript level that typically modulates some of the negative effects of aneuploidy. Further, the majority of differentially expressed proteins between aneuploid strains were encoded by non-aneuploid chromosomes and were not driven by a significant underlying transcript change, suggesting that aneuploidy is accompanied by extensive post-transcriptional protein-level modulation. This makes Leishmania a unique Eukaryotic model for elucidating post-transcriptional protein-abundance modulation in the context of aneuploidy.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Data availability:</strong></p><p>Proteomic data associated with this study are available in the PRIDE repository: accession number <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD028521' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>PXD028521</a>.</p>",

Briefly, hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) was carried out on a Dionex UltiMate 3000 RSLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, HemelHempstead, UK) using a ZIC-HILIC column (150 mm x 2.1 mm, 5 \u03bcm; Merck/SeQuant) with a guard column (20 mm x 2.1 mm, 5 \u03bcm; Merck/SeQuant). The column was maintained at 30 \u00b0C and samples were eluted with a linear gradient <strong>(A)</strong> 0.08% formic acid in acetonitrile and <strong>(B)</strong> 0.1% formic acid in water. The flow rate was 100 \u03bcl/min, with an injection volume of 10 \u03bcl with samples maintained at 5 \u00b0C prior to introduction. Gradient elution was performed starting with 80% solvent <strong>A</strong>. Within a 6 min time interval, solvent <strong>B</strong> was increased to 40% and maintained for 12 min, followed by an increase to 90% within 4 min. This was maintained for 2 min, after which the system returned to the initial solvent composition in 2 min. The whole system was allowed to re-equilibrate under these conditions for 14 min.</p><p><br></p><p>Both negative and positive ion modes were run in parallel with rapid polarity switching. Samples were analyzed in randomized order and the same analytical batch. Additionally, to aid accurate metabolite identification, verify LC-MS stability, and identify contaminants, the following control samples were included as well: <strong>(1)</strong> solvents blanks, <strong>(2)</strong> serial dilutions of a pooled sample (Undiluted, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, and 1/16), <strong>(3)</strong> Authentic standard mixes containing in total 217 metabolites (50-400 Da) and representing a wide array of metabolic classes and pathways, <strong>(4)</strong> An amino acid standard mix (Sigma Product No. A9906).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Berg M, Garc\u00eda-Hern\u00e1ndez R, Cuypers B, Vanaerschot M, Manzano JI, Poveda JA, Ferragut JA, Castanys S, Dujardin JC, Gamarro F.

Each time, only unmatched peaks were aligned against the next database, reducing the number of potential identifications to the most likely candidates<strong>[5]</strong>. Peaks of which the intensity did not follow the dilution pattern in the pooled sample dilution series (<strong>Pearson correlation</strong> &gt;0.8 or <strong>p-value</strong> &gt;.05) were removed from the analysis with the <strong>mzMatch Dilution Trend Filter tool[6]</strong>. The remaining peaks were normalized for total ion count and visually verified before exporting them to a <strong>csv</strong> file containing all peak heights, retention times and relevant database annotations.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Doyle MA, MacRae JI, De Souza DP, Saunders EC, McConville MJ, Liki\u0107 VA.
