                "description": "Marine sponges (phylum Porifera) are leading organisms for the discovery of bioactive compounds from nature. Their often rich and species-specific microbiota is hypothesised to be producing many of these compounds. Yet, environmental influences on the sponge-associated microbiota and bioactive compound production remain elusive. Here, we investigated the changes of microbiota and metabolomes in sponges along a depth range of 1232\u00a0m. Using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and untargeted metabolomics, we assessed prokaryotic and chemical diversities in three deep-sea sponge species: Geodia barretti, Stryphnus fortis, and Weberella bursa. Both prokaryotic communities and metabolome varied significantly with depth, which we hypothesized to be the effect of different water masses. Up to 35.5% of microbial ASVs (amplicon sequence variants) showed significant changes with depth while phylum-level composition of host microbiome remained unchanged. The metabolome varied with depth, with relative quantities of known bioactive compounds increasing or decreasing strongly. Other metabolites varying with depth were compatible solutes regulating osmolarity of the cells. Correlations between prokaryotic community and the bioactive compounds in G. barretti suggested members of Acidobacteria, Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi, or an unclassified prokaryote as potential producers.",

All samples were taken during the same season (Sep\u2013Oct, Autumn) from 2011-2015. Samples were frozen on board (-20 \u00b0C) and shipped to the Bedford Institute of Oceanography (BIO, Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, Canada) for identification. Freeze-dried subsamples from the <strong>choanosome</strong> (i.e. inside of the sponge, to reduce the risks of surface contamination by epibionts) were sent to Uppsala University and stored at 8 \u00b0C until processing for global metabolite profiling. Sample identification was reassessed and all specimens of <strong>S. fortis</strong> were checked for the presence of Hexadella dedritifera[1] overgrowth. Frozen subsamples were sent to Wageningen University &amp; Research and stored at \u221220 \u00b0C until processing for prokaryotic community analyses.</p><p><br></p><p>Detailed sample information can be found in <strong>Table S1</strong>, in the paper associated with this study, (deposited at PANGAEA <a href='https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.909246' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.909246</a>).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Study site, geography and oceanography:</strong></p><p>The maximal geographic distance across the sampling site was 786 km, covering a depth range of 1232 m. To identify the potential effect of oceanographic conditions (e.g. seawater properties, currents and vertical velocities, water mass origin, age and mixing history) on sponge prokaryotic community compositions and metabolomes, all oceanographic data available for the study area were assembled. These oceanographic observations came from the World Ocean Database (<a href='https://www.nodc.noaa.gov/OC5/WOD/pr_wod.html' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>https://www.nodc.noaa.gov/OC5/WOD/pr_wod.html</a>) and Bedford Institute of Oceanography archives, and from Argo float profiles<strong>[2]</strong>. All vertical profiles of temperature and salinity obtained from discrete (e.g., water samples and reversing thermometers) and initially continuous and later subsampled measurements were checked for errors and vertically interpolated for every 5 m.</p><p><br></p><p>The Davis Strait where the samples were collected was found to be characterized by five water masses from shallow to deep: Shelf Water (ShW), Slope Water (SW), the Irminger Current (<strong>IC</strong>), Labrador Sea Water (<strong>LSW</strong>), and Icelandic Slope Water (ISW) (<strong>Fig. 2</strong>). Based on the sample depth, the samples in this study originated mainly from two water masses: those shallower than 1000 m were attributed to the<strong> IC</strong> with its core at about 600 m, a salinity of 34.93 psu, a temperature of 4.5 \u00b0C, and those from localities deeper than 1000 m were attributed to the <strong>LSW</strong> with its core at 1200 m, a salinity of 34.89 psu, a temperature of 3.7 \u00b0C.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Topsent, E.

Known metabolite features from G. barretti and S. fortis, and the features with the highest VIP scores in the OPLS model of the HILIC positive \u201ccleaned\u201d data set were manually annotated in the metabolome and their signal intensities across the samples were extracted. As the patterns and models based on unidentified metabolomic features underlying the OPLS model should be interpreted with caution, we applied a dual feature identification approach: (1) manually extracting signal intensities of known bioactive compounds and (2) de novo identification of features designated as VIPs by a general OPLS model including all sponge samples combined. Standards were ordered to confirm the identity of VIPs in a repeated UPLC-HRMS/MS experiment, and annotations were confirmed/rejected based on retention time and matching MS/MS spectra.</p>",
