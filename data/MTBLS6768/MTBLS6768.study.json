                "description": "<h4><strong>BACKGROUND: </strong>IgE-mediated cow's milk allergy (IgE-CMA) is one of the first allergies to arise in early childhood and may result from exposure to various milk allergens, of which \u03b2-lactoglobulin (BLG) and casein are the most important. Understanding the underlying mechanisms behind IgE-CMA is imperative for the discovery of novel biomarkers and the design of innovative treatment and prevention strategies.</h4><h4><strong>METHODS: </strong>We report a longitudinal <em>in&nbsp;vivo</em> murine model, in which two mice strains (BALB/c and C57Bl/6) were sensitized to BLG using either cholera toxin or an oil emulsion (n\u2009=\u20096 per group). After sensitization, mice were challenged orally, their clinical signs monitored, antibody (IgE and IgG1) and cytokine levels (IL-4 and IFN-\u03b3) measured, and fecal samples subjected to metabolomics. The results of the murine models were further extrapolated to fecal microbiome-metabolome data from our population of IgE-CMA (n\u2009=\u200922) and healthy (n\u2009=\u200923) children (Trial: NCT04249973), on which polar metabolomics, lipidomics and 16S rRNA metasequencing were performed. In&nbsp;vitro gastrointestinal digestions and multi-omics corroborated the microbial origin of proposed metabolic changes.</h4><h4><strong>RESULTS: </strong>During mice sensitization, we observed multiple microbially derived metabolic alterations, most importantly bile acid, energy and tryptophan metabolites, that preceded allergic inflammation. We confirmed microbial dysbiosis, and its associated effect on metabolic alterations in our patient cohort, through <em>in&nbsp;vitro</em> digestions and multi-omics, which was accompanied by metabolic signatures of low-grade inflammation.</h4><h4><strong>CONCLUSION: </strong>Our results indicate that gut dysbiosis precedes allergic inflammation and nurtures a chronic low-grade inflammation in children on elimination diets, opening important new opportunities for future prevention and treatment strategies.</h4>",

                        "description": "<p><strong><em>In vivo</em> murine experiments:</strong></p><p>3- and 6-wk-old female BALB/c and C57Bl/6 mice were obtained from Charles River (Charles River Laboratories, Saint-Germain Nuelles, France), and were housed 3 per individually ventilated cage at the VIB Center for Inflammation Research (Ghent, Belgium), under normal specific pathogen-free (SPF) husbandry conditions, receiving standard chow (Mouse-Breeding Feed, Ssniff, Soest, Germany) and tap water ad libitum. Following 1 wk of acclimatization, mice were divided into different treatment groups (n = 6 per group). </p><p><br></p><p>The first protocol was based on a previously published method<strong>[1]</strong>, in which 4-wk-old mice received (1) 1 mg beta-lactoglobulin (BLG) per g body weight mixed with 10 \u00b5g of cholera toxin (CT) in 0.1 ml PBS. Control groups received (2) 1 mg BLG per g body weight in PBS, (3) 10 \u00b5g of CT in PBS, or (4) PBS alone (n = 6 mice per group). Sensitization was performed on days 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35, by means of intragastric gavages, and was combined with the collection of urine and fecal samples.</p><p><br></p><p>The second protocol was adapted from a prevously described method<strong>[2]</strong>. Briefly, 7-wk-old mice were intragastrically administered 1 mg BLG in 0.1 ml individual antigen solution, which was either PBS or an oil emulsion (saline, linoleic acid, and lecithin at 5:4:1 by volume). Intraperitoneal administration of 0.1 ml PBS or PBS containing 0.2 mg sodium salicylate (SA) was given immediately afterward. Mice were divided into 6 groups (n = 6 mice per group) and given different test materials: (1) BLG in PBS + SA and (2) BLG in oil + SA groups were given the BLG in either PBS or oil, followed by injection of SA, control groups included (3) BLG in PBS + PBS and (4) BLG in oil + PBS, which were given BLG in PBS or oil emulsion with an injection of PBS, and (5) None in PBS + SA and (6) None in oil + SA (vehicle controls) which were given the vehicle without BLG, followed by injection of SA. Each solution was given 5x a week for 3 wk. Urine and fecal samples were collected on days 0, 7, 14, and 21. 1 mouse (BLG in oil + SA) was lost on day 21.</p><p><br></p><p>Antigen challenge was performed on the day the mice were 70 d old. All groups were fasted overnight and orally challenged twice (30 min apart) with 30 mg BLG in 0.1 ml PBS. On the day of the challenge, urine and fecal samples were collected from each mouse for metabolomics analysis. Anaphylactic responses were evaluated by scoring symptoms for 2 h after the final challenge. Scores were as follows: 0 = no symptoms; 1 = scratching and rubbing around the nose and head; 2 = puffiness around the eyes and mouth and pilar erecti; 3 = decreased activity with increased respiratory rate; 4 = wheezing and labored respiration; 5 = cyanosis around the mouth and the tail; 6 = death within 24 h. Samples were immediately stored at -80 \u00b0C, and fecal samples were lyophilized within 1 wk after sample collection. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Pediatric cohort:</strong></p><p>Patient selection criteria encompassed children (1) diagnosed with IgE-CMA, while the control groups encompassed children (2) diagnosed with other IgE-mediated FAs (IgE-other), (3) suspected of a CMA and consequently on a CMP-free diet, notwithstanding negative IgE-measurements, and (4) nonallergic siblings from the aforementioned groups. The latter was applied to account for both environmental and genetic predispositions to FA development.</p><p><br></p><p>Food allergies were diagnosed by the treating physician and were based on a combination of positive IgE test results (skin prick tests, specific IgE measurements, or both), a recent history of IgE-mediated symptoms (skin-related reactions, gastrointestinal and respiratory symptoms, anaphylaxis) within 2 h after ingestion of the respective foods, and improvement upon elimination diet. Urine (n = 74) and feces (n = 81) were collected from each patient shortly after diagnosis. Fecal samples were collected through spontaneous defecation in the diaper or using a Fecotainer (AT Medical B.V., Enschede, The Netherlands). Urine samples were collected using The Newcastle Urine Collector (SteriSets Medical Products, Guilhufe, Portugal) or directly in a plastic container. Samples were stored at -20 \u00b0C until pick-up (&lt; 1 wk). Following cooled transport (dry ice or icepacks) to the lab, fecal samples were briefly stored at -80 \u00b0C, lyophilized, and homogenized in preparation for more long-term storage at -80 \u00b0C. Urine samples were thawed and aliquoted upon arrival at the lab and stored at -80 \u00b0C awaiting analysis.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>In vitro</em> gastrointestinal digestions:</strong></p><p>2 different cow\u2019s milk powder formulations were used, i.e. Nutrilon 1 and Nutrilon Pepti 1 (Nutricia, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Feces were obtained from 6 children within the original cohort (&lt;2 yr old; 50% girls), without a history of antibiotic treatment 6 mth prior to donation. Among the 6 participants, 2 children suffered from IgE-CMA, and 2 were designated as healthy controls. 2 other children were initially diagnosed with IgE-CMA and were categorized as such in our patient cohort. However, at the time of the in vitro digestions, these patients no longer exhibited symptoms, indicating IgE-CMA resolution. <em>In vitro</em> simulation of the gastrointestinal digestion consisted of enzymatic digestion (mouth, stomach, and duodenum) followed by colonic fermentation. Preparation of fecal inocula, digestion fluids, and their incubations, were carried out as previously described<strong>[3][4]</strong>. The inorganic fractions of the digestion fluids were autoclaved before use, except duodenal juice and pepsin solution (4 mg/100 ml). The latter was filter sterilized through a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (0.22 \u00b5m, 33 mm diameter, Millex, USA). All digestion fluids were stored at 4 \u00b0C awaiting use. The composition of the inorganic gastric fluid was adjusted to match the gastrointestinal digestion of children, thereby pursuing a gastric pH of 3, instead of 1.3. On the day of the in vitrodigestion, 920 mg milk powder was dissolved in 6 ml simulated saliva, after which the different other digestion fluids were added chronologically and when necessary incubated (150 rpm, 37 \u00b0C, New Brunswick Innova 42, Eppendorf). Samples were taken immediately following the addition of SHIME (Simulator of the Human Intestinal Microbial Ecosystem) medium and fecal inoculum in Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) medium or BHI medium alone (duodenal samples, T0) for comparison, and after colonic digestion (T48). For each fecal inoculum (n = 2 per group), a separate incubation was performed, using either Nutrilon (n = 4 biological replicates) or Nutrilon Pepti 1 (n = 4 biological replicates). Digested samples were stored at -80 \u00b0C until analysis.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Adel-Patient K, Bernard H, Ah-Leung S, Cr\u00e9minon C, Wal JM.

Subsequent to 30 s of thorough vortexing, 1 ml of an ice-cold methanol and ultrapure water (80:20, v/v) mixture was added. The supernatant of the solid-liquid extraction was collected after 1 min of vortexing and 10 min of rotation, followed by a 10-min centrifugation step (13,300 x g, at 4 \u00b0C). Next, the extract was passed over a polyamide filter (diameter of 25mm and pore size of 0.45 mm) (Machery-Nagel, D\u00fcren, Germany), diluted (1:3) with ultrapure water and transferred to a glass HPLC-vial.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Fecal lipidomics:</strong></p><p>Fecal samples were prepared and analyzed in a randomized order as previously described<strong>[3]</strong>.

Thereafter, 3 ml of ultrapure water with 2.5% trichloroacetic acid (w/v) was added to induce phase separation, which was enforced by centrifugation for 5 min at 3000 rpm at 20 \u00b0C. Next, 1 ml of the upper layer, consisting of methyl tert-butyl ether, was collected and evaporated to dryness at 30 \u00b0C under a gentle stream of nitrogen.

Targeted metabolic profiling included 130 compounds, belonging to the microbial (n = 22), tryptophan (n = 24), histidine (n = 5), carbohydrate (n = 13), lipid (n = 17), nucleotide (n = 19), phenylalanine (n = 8) and amino acid (n = 22) metabolism, which were selected based on our systematic literature review on relevant metabolites in pediatric food allergy.</p><p><br></p><p>For lipidomics, 92 compounds were included, which were further divided into sterol lipids (n = 9), fatty acids (n = 30), glycerophospholipids (n = 20) and sphingolipids (n = 8), as well as microbial (n = 5) and energy metabolism (n = 20). Prior to univariate statistical analysis, data were preprocessed by QC-normalization and analyzed through <strong>R version 3.4.3 i</strong>ntegrated into our <strong>in-house data analysis pipeline </strong>(Marilynux version 20200310, Laboratory of Integrative Metabolomics, Belgium). Model validity of the pairwise comparisons was evaluated by <strong>Wilcoxon rank-sum tests</strong> or <strong>Welch Two-Sample t-testing</strong> for non-parametric and parametric data, respectively. Multiple comparisons were validated using <strong>one-way ANOVA</strong> for parametric data or <strong>Kruskal-Wallis rank-sum testing</strong> for non-parametric data, followed by <strong>Tukey\u2019s</strong> or <strong>Dunn\u2019s <em>post hoc</em> test,</strong> respectively. Correction for confounding variables, i.e. cage-effect in murine experiments, and age and sex in the patient cohort, was performed using linear mixed models with fixed and random variables in <strong>SPSS</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p>Untargeted data interpretation was achieved using <strong>Compound Discoverer 3.1</strong> (Thermo Fischer Scientific, San Jos\u00e9, CA, USA) on the full-scan data, allowing to process positive and negative ionization modes together. This program applied automated peak alignment, peak extraction, deconvolution, blank peak filtering, and noise removal. Multivariate statistical analysis was achieved using <strong>SIMCA 14.1 software</strong> (Umetrics AB, Sweden), for which data were preprocessed by QC-normalization, log-transformation, and <strong>Pareto-scaling</strong>. <strong>Principal component analysis (PCA-X)</strong> was applied to visualize samples' natural patterning and identify outliers. Supervised modeling was performed by <strong>orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA)</strong>. The validity of these models was assessed by <strong>cross-validated analysis of variance (CV-ANOVA, p-value)</strong>, permutation testing (n = 100), and the model characteristics <strong>R2(Y) </strong>for model fit and <strong>Q2(Y) </strong>for model predictivity. The selection of discriminative components was based on <strong>variable importance in projection (VIP) score</strong> &gt; 1.5 and jack-knifed confidence interval not across zero, followed by univariate statistical analysis. From the validated <strong>OPLS-DA model</strong> of sensitized BALB/c mice, the most contributing metabolites, based on an S-plot covariance &gt; 0.03, S-plot correlation &gt; 0.2, VIP-value &gt; 2 and/or p-value &lt; 0.05 were retained for fragmentation and thus annotation. For the fecal metabolomics and lipidomics on our patient cohort, selection was respectively based on an S-plot covariance &gt; 0.025 or 0.020, S-plot correlation &gt; 0.35 or 0.40, VIP-value &gt; 3 and/or p-value &lt; 0.05. Functional and correlation analyses were performed through <strong>Compound Discoverer 3.1</strong> and/or <strong>R version 3.4.3</strong> integrated into our <strong>in-house Marilynux data processing pipeline</strong> for untargeted processing. Data were QC-normalized, log-transformed, and Pareto-scaled. Functional analysis was performed in <strong>MetaboAnalyst 5.0</strong> using the <strong>mummichog</strong> algorithm, with a default significance cutoff of 0.25, and the KEGG pathway library (<em>Mus musculus</em> or <em>Homo sapiens</em>).</p>",

As a second step, <strong>MS/MS</strong> fragmentation profiles enabled further structure elucidation. To this end, Q-Exactive hybrid Q-Orbitrap mass spectrometry was implemented for which the chromatographic separation and ionization settings were the same as described earlier. <strong>Parallel reaction monitoring (PRM)</strong> applied the following <strong>MS/MS</strong> parameters for respectively polar or lipid identification: a resolution of 17,500 or 35,000 FWHM, AGC target of 2e^5, maximum injection time of 100 ms, and an isolation window of 1.0 or 0.5 m/z. The collision energy was set at 30, 50, and 70 eV for polar metabolomics and 15, 30, and 55 eV for lipidomics. The selection of full MS peaks relied on a minimum integrated peak area of 500,000 a.u. and a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) &gt; 10. The online open-source <strong>Global Natural Products Social Molecular Networking (GNPS) ecosystem[1]</strong>, as well as <strong>Compound Discoverer 3.1</strong>, <strong>MS2Query[2]</strong>, and <strong>SIRIUS4[3]</strong>, were consulted for fragmentation matching, after which the fragmentation spectrum of the tentatively identified compounds was compared with those of analytical standards. Components were assigned different levels of identification according to previously published criteria<strong>[4]</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Wang Q, Garrity GM, Tiedje JM, Cole JR.
