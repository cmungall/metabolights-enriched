                "description": "Metabolic variations occur during normal pregnancy to provide the growing fetus with a supply of nutrients required for its development and to ensure the health of the woman during gestation. Mass spectrometry-based metabolomics was employed to study the metabolic phenotype variations in the maternal plasma that are induced by pregnancy in each of its three trimesters. Nontargeted metabolomics analysis showed that pregnancy significantly altered the profile of metabolites in maternal plasma. The levels of six metabolites were found to change significantly throughout pregnancy, with related metabolic pathway variations observed in biopterin metabolism, phospholipid metabolism, amino acid derivatives, and fatty acid oxidation. In particular, there was a pronounced elevation of dihydrobiopterin (BH2), a compound produced in the synthesis of dopa, dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine, in the second trimester, whereas it was markedly decreased in the third trimester. The turnover of BH2 and tryptophan catabolites indicated that the fluctuations of neurotransmitters throughout pregnancy might reveal the metabolic adaption in the maternal body for the growth of the fetus. Furthermore, 11 lipid classes and 41 carnitine species were also determined and this showed variations in the presence of long-chain acylcarnitines and lysophospholipids in later pregnancy, suggesting changes of acylcarnitines and lysophospholipids to meet the energy demands in pregnant women.",

Sample analysis was carried out in both positive and negative ion modes. The mass scanning range was 50\u20131500 m/z, and the capillary temperature was 350 \u00b0C. Nitrogen sheath gas was set at a flow rate of 30 l/min. Nitrogen auxiliary gas was set at a flow rate of 10 l/min. Spray voltage was set to 4.5 kV for positive ion mode and 3 kV for negative ion mode.\n</p>\nLipidome and carnitine profiling were detected by multiplexed precursor ion scanning (MPIS) analysis. First, 100 \u03bcl of final extract was loaded in a well of a 96-well plate (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) and then sealed with aluminum foil. The final extracts were then analyzed using a QTRAP 5500 System equipped with a Shimadzu Prominence HPLC system (Shimadzu). Liquid chromatography and flow injection analysis\u2013mass spectrometry were employed to acquire the data. The electrospray source was operated in the positive ion mode. Optimized source parameters were: ionspray voltage 5.5 kV, source temperature 300 \u00b0C, curtain gas 30. Collision energies ranged from 25 to 30 V for various lipid species in precursor ion or neutral loss scan modes. Flow injections analysis was performed with a mixture of chloroform\u2013methanol\u201310 mM ammonium acetate in water (300/665/35, V/V/V) at a flow rate of 200 \u03bcl/min. Total analysis time per sample was 3.6 min. PC, PE, PS, PI, PG, Cer, and carnitines were monitored by consecutive positive ion mode PIS m/z 184.1, 141.0, 185.0, 277.0, 189.0, 264.2, and 85.1, respectively. ",

A list of the ion intensities of each peak detected was generated using retention time (RT) and the m/z data pairs as identifiers for each ion. The resulting three-dimensional matrix contained arbitrarily assigned peak indices (retention time\u2013m/z pairs), sample names (observations), and ion intensity information (variables).",
