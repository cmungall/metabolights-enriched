                "description": "Metabolic perturbations resulting from excessive hepatic fat accumulation are poorly understood. Thus, in this study, leptin-deficient ob/ob mice, a mouse model of fatty liver disease, were used to investigate metabolic alterations in more detail. Metabolites were quantified in intact liver tissues of ob/ob (n=8) and control (n=8) mice using high-resolution magic angle spinning (HR-MAS) 1H-NMR. In addition, after demonstrating that HR-MAS 1H-NMR does not affect RNA integrity, transcriptional changes were measured by quantitative real-time PCR on RNA extracted from the same specimens after HR-MAS 1H-NMR measurements. Importantly, the gene expression changes obtained agreed with those observed by Affymetrix microarray analysis performed on RNA isolated directly from fresh-frozen tissue. In total, 40 metabolites could be assigned in the spectra and subsequently quantified. Quantification of lactate was also possible after applying a lactate-editing pulse sequence that suppresses the lipid signal, which superimposes the lactate methyl resonance at 1.3 ppm. Significant differences were detected for creatinine, glutamate, glycine, glycolate, trimethylamine-N-oxide, dimethylglycine, ADP, AMP, betaine, phenylalanine, and uridine. Furthermore, alterations in one-carbon metabolism, supported by both metabolic and transcriptional changes, were observed. These included reduced demethylation of betaine to dimethylglycine and the reduced expression of genes coding for transsulfuration pathway enzymes, which appears to preserve methionine levels, but may limit glutathione synthesis. Overall, the combined approach is advantageous as it identifies changes not only at the single gene or metabolite level but also deregulated pathways, thus providing critical insight into changes accompanying fatty liver disease. Graphical abstract A Evaluation of RNA integrity before and after HR-MAS 1H-NMR of intact mouse liver tissue. B Metabolite concentrations and gene expression levels assessed in ob/ob (steatotic) and ob/+ (control) mice using HR-MAS 1H-NMR and qRT-PCR, respectively.",

The latter do not develop a steatotic phenotype and were therefore used as controls. 2 biological tissue replicates were analyzed from each animal. All mice were purchased at the age of 8 weeks (Charles River, strain B6.Cg-Lepob/J) and allowed to acclimatize for 1 week. The mice were fed a Ssniff R/M-H 10-mm pellet standard diet (Ssniff, Soest, Germany) and received water ad libitum. At the age of 9 weeks, body weight was determined prior to anesthetization with ketamine/xylazine. The\nwhole liver was carefully excised without damaging the liver capsule. After recording the liver weight, the median lobe from each liver was stained with hematoxylin\u2013eosin (H&E) for assessment of histology. For this purpose, the tissue was transferred to paraffin embedding cassettes (Carl Roth,Karlsruhe, Germany), fixed in 4% neutral buffered (pH 7) formaldehyde (Roti-Histofix, Carl Roth) for 48 hr at 4 \u00b0C, washed in PBS for 48 h, and placed in a STP120 spin tissue processor (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Walldorf, Germany), where they were dehydrated through an ethanol gradient (70, 90, and 99% ethanol), and incubated in xylene (Carl Roth) before the embedding in paraffin. Paraffin-embedded tissue was sectioned with a feather blade-type N35HR in an HM 450 Sliding Microtome (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Walldorf, Germany) with a thickness of 4 \u00b5m and used for H&E staining according to a standard protocol. Briefly, the tissue sections were deparaffinized in Roti-Histol (Carl Roth), rehydrated through an ethanol gradient (5 min in 100, 95, 90, and 70%), stained with Mayer\u2019s hematoxylin (Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) for 5 min, and rinsed under running tap water for 10 min. Next, the slides were immersed in 1% Eosin Y (Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany) for 3 min, dehydrated through an ethanol gradient (70, 90, 95, and 100%), cleared in Roti-Histol, and mounted with Entellan (Merck Millipore). The remaining liver lobes were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 \u00b0C for NMR analysis.",

                        "description": "Quantification of low molecular weight metabolites was performed with a spin-echo Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) pulse sequence, using a total T2 delay of 400 ms. 128 scans over the spectral region of 10 kHz were acquired in 16 k of total complex points. Relaxation delays for all measurements were chosen as 5 x T1max, where T1max denotes the spin lattice relaxation time of the slowest relaxing metabolite.\n</p>\n1D nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (1D-NOESY) was used to quantify lipid signals. The water signal was suppressed using a continuous wave presaturation pulse of 2 s duration with an additional 2 s relaxation delay before the water presaturation delay. In order to suppress longitudinal water magnetization after the second pulse, another presaturation step of 10 ms duration was applied between the second and third pulse of the sequence. Under these conditions an excellent water suppression was achieved and, at the same time, the radiofrequency duty cycle could be kept at a minimum to avoid excessive power dissipation in the sample. As the acquisition time was 819 ms, the total relaxation delay resulted in 4.819 s. Thus, with the T1 times being in the range of 0.75 s to 0.95 s for metabolites and in the range of 0.33 s to 0.40 s for lipids, full relaxation was obtained. Since the T2 values for the metabolites ranged from 95 to 286 ms and the overall echo delay of the CPMG sequence was 400 ms, a T2 correction was performed to compensate for the relaxation losses.\n</p>\nAs the lactate signal overlaps with the signal of lipid CH2 groups, a lactate editing sequence was used to enable lactate quantification. The editing sequence applies a double quantum filter for the selective excitation of the CH3 group signal of lactate. The lipid signals are dephased by employing a pulsed field gradient after the fourth pulse. In order to simplify data processing, a refocused sequence, giving an in-phase lactate doublet, was used. A series of measurements of lactate in the relevant concentration range was performed to calculate a calibration curve to quantify lactate.\n</p>\nThe duration of the selective Gaussian pulses in the lactate editing sequences was 12.29 ms throughout. The echo delay was adjusted to a coupling constant of 6.9 Hz, resulting in 72.46 ms. 64 scans and 4 dummy scans were acquired. The total measurement time was 40 min per sample. To study the influence of the measurement time on RNA integrity, the number of scans for 1D-NOESY and lactate editing were adjusted; whereas, the number of scans for the CPMG experiment was kept constant.",
