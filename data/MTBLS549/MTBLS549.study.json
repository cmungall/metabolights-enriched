                "description": "During human fasting, metabolic markers, including butyrates, carnitines, and branched-chain amino acids, are upregulated for energy substitution through gluconeogenesis and use of stored lipids. We performed non-targeted, accurate semiquantitative metabolomic analysis of human whole blood, plasma, and red blood cells during 34-58\u2009hr fasting of four volunteers. During this period, 44 of ~130 metabolites increased 1.5~60-fold. Consistently fourteen were previously reported. However, we identified another 30 elevated metabolites, implicating hitherto unrecognized metabolic mechanisms induced by fasting. Metabolites in pentose phosphate pathway are abundant, probably due to demand for antioxidants, NADPH, gluconeogenesis and anabolic metabolism. Global increases of TCA cycle-related compounds reflect enhanced mitochondrial activity in tissues during fasting. Enhanced purine/pyrimidine metabolites support RNA/protein synthesis and transcriptional reprogramming, which is promoted also by some fasting-related metabolites, possibly via epigenetic modulations. Thus diverse, pronounced metabolite increases result from greatly activated catabolism and anabolism stimulated by fasting. Anti-oxidation may be a principal response to fasting.",

Venous blood samples for metabolomics analysis were taken into 50-ml heparinized tubes (Terumo). Immediately, 0.2 ml of blood (8\u201312 x 10^8 RBCs) were quenched in 1.8 ml of 55% (vol/vol) methanol at \u221240 \u00b0C. This quick-quenching step immediately after blood sampling ensured accurate measurement of many labile metabolites. The use of whole blood samples also allowed us to observe cellular metabolite levels that might otherwise have been affected by lengthy cell separation procedures. The remaining blood sample from each donor was centrifuged at 120 x g for 15 min at room temperature to separate plasma and RBCs. After centrifugation, 0.2 ml each of separated plasma and RBCs (14\u201320 x 10^8 RBCs) were quenched in 1.8 ml of 55% methanol at \u221240 \u00b0C. 2 internal standards (10 nmol Hepes and PIPES) were added to each sample. After brief vortexing, samples were transferred to Amicon Ultra 10-kDa cutoff filters (Millipore) to remove proteins and cellular debris. Thus, from each blood sample, 3 different subsamples\u2014whole blood, RBCs, and plasma\u2014were prepared. After sample concentration by vacuum evaporation, each sample was resuspended in 40 \u03bcl of 50% acetonitrile, and 1 \u03bcl was used for each injection into the LC-MS system.",
