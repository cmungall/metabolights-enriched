                "description": "Head and neck cancer (HNC) is a heterogeneous malignant disease with distinct global distribution. Metabolic adaptations of HNC are significantly gaining clinical interests nowadays. Here, we investigated effects of HNC on differential expression of volatile metabolites in human saliva. We applied headspace solid phase microextraction coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of saliva samples collected from 59 human subjects (HNC - 32, Control - 27). We identified and quantified 48 volatile organic metabolites (VOMs) and observed profound effects of HNC on these metabolites. These effects were VOM specific and significantly differed in the biologically comparable healthy controls. HNC induced changes in salivary VOM composition were well attributed to in vivo metabolic effects. A panel of 15 VOMs with variable importance in projection (VIP) score >1, false discovery rate (FDR) corrected p-value\u2009<\u20090.05 and log2 fold change (log2 FC) value of \u22650.58/\u2264-0.58 were regarded as discriminatory metabolites of pathophysiological importance. Afterwards, receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC) projected certain VOMs viz., 1,4-dichlorobenzene, 1,2-decanediol, 2,5-bis1,1-dimethylethylphenol and E-3-decen-2-ol with profound metabolic effects of HNC and highest class segregation potential. Moreover, metabolic pathways analysis portrayed several dysregulated pathways in HNC, which enhanced our basic understanding on salivary VOM changes. Our observations could redefine several known/already investigated systemic phenomenons (e.g. biochemical pathways). These findings will inspire further research in this direction and may open unconventional avenues for non-invasive monitoring of HNC and its therapy in the future.",

Subject inclusion criteria for HNC were minimum 18 years old patient with histopathological confirmation of malignant lesion without any anticancer therapeutic intervention. Similarly, age and gender matched control subjects without hypertension, diabetes or any medication during last 3 months were recruited for this study. The clinical attributes of the study cohort are summarized in Table S5 of the paper associated with this study.</div><div><br></div><div>Saliva sampling was performed as recently reported[1]. Briefly, the saliva samples were collected during hospitalisation between 9.00 am to 12.00 at noon. Eating and drinking was not allowed at least 2 hr prior to sample collection. Each subject thoroughly rinsed their mouth with water and approximately 2 ml un-stimulated saliva was collected in 10 ml sterilised glass vial with screw cap and immediately placed on ice. All the samples were transported to the laboratory within 1 hr of sample collection and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until further processing.</div><div><br></div><div>Ref:<br>[1] Cavaco C, Pereira JAM, Taunk K, Taware R, Rapole S, Nagarajaram H, C\u00e2mara JS.

Accordingly, samples were ice thawed and 1 ml saliva was transferred to a 4 ml headspace glass vial (Thermo Fisher, USA), acidified with 125 \u00b5l of 5 M HCL (Merck, Germany) and added 100 mg of NaCl (Merck, Germany). A magnetic stirring bar (0.5 x 0.1 mm) was also added to the vial that was closed with a Teflon (PTFE) septum screw cap. To concentrate the VOMs, a carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane (CAR/PDMS, 75 \u03bcm, Supelco, USA) SPME fibre was exposed to the headspace of the vial through the PTFE septa and incubated at 38 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C for 45 min with continuous stirring at 800 rpm. After incubation, CAR/PDMS fibre was desorbed in the back-inlet port of the GC (250 \u00b0C) for 6 min. The CAR/PDMS fibre was preconditioned at 260 \u00b0C for 20 min to eliminate any residual VOMs from previous samples.</div><div><br></div><div>Ref:</div><div>[1] Cavaco C, Pereira JAM, Taunk K, Taware R, Rapole S, Nagarajaram H, C\u00e2mara JS.

Helium (99.999% purity, Prama Enterprises, India) was used as carrier gas at 1 m/min. The injections in splitless mode were performed with the back-inlet port maintained at 250 \u00b0C.&nbsp; All the samples were acquired in duplicate. Quality control samples were acquired (after every 10 samples) and blanks (after every 3 samples) to check the run to run variation as well as to detect any residual overhang of the previous samples.<br>",
