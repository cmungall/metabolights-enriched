                "description": "Heavy metal contamination poses an escalating global challenge to soil ecosystems. Hyperaccumulators play a crucial role in environmental remediation and resource recovery. The enrichment of diazotrophs and resulting nitrogen accumulation promoted hyperaccumulator growth and facilitated phytoremediation. Nonetheless, the regulatory mechanism of hyperaccumulator biological nitrogen fixation has remained elusive. Here, we report the mechanism by which arsenic regulates biological nitrogen fixation in the arsenic-hyperaccumulator Pteris vittata. Field investigations and greenhouse experiments, based on multi-omics approaches, reveal that elevated arsenic stress induces an enrichment of key diazotrophs, enhances plant nitrogen acquisition, and thus improves plant growth. Metabolomic analysis and microfluidic experiments further demonstrate that the upregulation of specific root metabolites plays a crucial role in recruiting key diazotrophic bacteria. These findings highlight the pivotal role of nitrogen-acquisition mechanisms in the arsenic hyperaccumulation of Pteris vittata, and provide valuable insights into the plant stress resistance.",

Full MS-data dependent MS/MS (Full MS-ddMS2) mode was employed with the following parameters: sheath gas flow rate of 30 arb, auxiliary gas flow rate of 10 arb, spray voltage set to 3.50 kV for ESI(+) and -2.50 kV for ESI(-), capillary temperature at 325 \u00b0C. The full MS scans were performed with a resolving power of 60,000 FWHM, spanning a mass-to-charge ratio range of 81-1000 m/z. Depended on the full MS scan data, the top 8 precursor ions with the highest intensity were selected for further MS/MS fragmentation, with dynamic exclusion applied to remove unnecessary MS/MS information. Higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) was utilized for further MS/MS fragmentation, with a normalized collision energy set to 30% and a resolving power of 15,000 FWHM.</p>",
