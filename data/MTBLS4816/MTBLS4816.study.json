                "description": "Children are at high risk for influenza A virus (IAV) infections, which can develop into severe illnesses. However, little is known about interactions between the microbiome and respiratory tract metabolites and their impact on the development of IAV pneumonia in children. Using a combination of liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we analyzed the composition and metabolic profile of the oropharyngeal microbiota in 49 pediatric patients with IAV pneumonia and 42 age-matched healthy children. The results indicate that compared to healthy children, children with IAV pneumonia exhibited significant changes in the oropharyngeal macrobiotic structure (<i>p =</i> 0.001), and significantly lower microbial abundance and diversity (<i>p <</i> 0.05). These changes came with significant disturbances in the levels of oropharyngeal metabolites. Intergroup differences were observed in 204 metabolites mapped to 36 metabolic pathways. Significantly higher levels of sphingolipid (sphinganine and phytosphingosine) and propanoate (propionic acid and succinic acid) metabolism were observed in patients with IAV pneumonia than in healthy controls. Using Spearman's rank-correlation analysis, correlations between IAV pneumonia-associated discriminatory microbial genera and metabolites were evaluated. The results indicate significant correlations and consistency in variation trends between <i>Streptococcus</i> and three sphingolipid metabolites (phytosphingosine, sphinganine, and sphingosine). Besides these three sphingolipid metabolites, the sphinganine-to-sphingosine ratio and the joint analysis of the three metabolites indicated remarkable diagnostic efficacy in children with IAV pneumonia. This study confirmed significant changes in the characteristics and metabolic profile of the oropharyngeal microbiome in pediatric patients with IAV pneumonia, with high synergy between the two factors. Oropharyngeal sphingolipid metabolites may serve as potential diagnostic biomarkers of IAV pneumonia in children.",

We collected samples in the morning, and participants refrained from brushing their teeth 12 h before sampling, rinsed or drank water 2 h before sampling to remove oral debris, followed by a 2 h fast to reduce the impact on the oropharyngeal microbiota and metabolome. A sterile tongue depressor was inserted to fully expose the deep pharynx. Then the swab was inserted into the pharynx and rotated twice against the posterior pharyngeal wall or the pharyngeal-palatal arch, avoiding contact with other areas such as the tongue, uvula, and gingiva. An experienced pediatrician or nurse performed all procedures. The oropharyngeal swab samples were immediately put on ice and sent to a biological specimen bank, where they were stored at -80 \u00b0C until further analysis. Unused swabs were used as blank controls to assess contamination during the experiment.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Hogan CA, Rajpurkar P, Sowrirajan H, Phillips NA, Le AT, Wu M, Garamani N, Sahoo MK, Wood ML, Huang C, Ng AY, Mak J, Cowan TM, Pinsky BA.

The deviation values were filtered according to the coefficient of variation, the missing values in the data were filled by one-half of the minimum value, the individual peaks were filtered, and the peak area of the internal standard in each sample was normalized.

Data are presented as mean \u00b1 standard deviation, and the <strong>Mann-Whitney U test</strong> was performed to compare 2 independent samples having a non-normal distribution. The count data are expressed as the number of cases or percentages (%), and the <strong>Chi-square test</strong> was used to compare groups. The <strong>R vegan package</strong> was used to perform the <strong>permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA)</strong>, and 1,000 permutations were used to calculate the <strong>adonis p-value[1][2]</strong>. Spearman rank-correlation analysis was used to determine the associations between the microbiome and metabolites. The final data set from the <strong>LC-MS/MS</strong> analysis was imported into the <strong>SIMCA 16.0.2 software package (Sartorius Stedim Data Analytics AB, Umea, Sweden)</strong>. The importance of the <strong>variable in the projection (VIP)</strong> of the first principal component of each metabolite was calculated by building an <strong>orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis model (OPLS-DA)</strong>. 7-fold cross-validation was used to obtain <strong>R2</strong> and <strong>Q2</strong> to assess model validity. The <strong>Mann-Whitney U test</strong> was used to determine differences between the 2 groups; differences defined as <strong>p &lt; 0.05</strong> and <strong>VIP &gt; 1</strong> were considered significant.
