                "description": "In aquatic environments, the production and consumption of organic compounds is directly tied to the metabolic potential of the in situ microbial community. The community\u2019s metabolic potential can be assessed using metatranscriptomics, which is a measure of gene expression in the environment. More recently, advances in metabolomics deliver details on specific organic compounds found in the environment. While the integration of these two datasets is desirable, the vast data streams can hinder investigations into biological and chemical processes. Here, we use data in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) combined with K means clustering to jointly interrogate metabolomics and metatranscriptomics data collected from a coastal marine environment. Using KEGG allowed us to focus our analysis on genes and compounds connected by a defined biochemical reaction. The K means clustering provided an unbiased means to place metabolites and genes into groups based on their temporal variability. Each of the groups defined by the K means clustering contained both transcripts and metabolites, which emphasized the interconnected nature of these two datasets. While conceptually simple, this analysis allowed us to explore a tractable number of biochemical pathways within our data. Continued development of computational tools to analyze meta-omics data is a pressing need. The application of tools such as described here is an exciting step towards integrated multi-omics data analysis that can be used to address broad questions in biogeochemical cycling.",

The column was re-equilibrated for 7 min between samples with solvent A. Each metabolite was quantified using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode with optimal parameters determined from infusion of authentic standards. Eight-point external calibration curves (0.5, 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 250, and 500 ng/ml) were generated for each compound by plotting peak area against concentration.\n</p>\nFor untargeted metabolomics analysis, LC separation was performed using a Synergi Fusion reversed phase column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) with the same gradient as for targeted analysis.",

Features were extracted from the LC-MS data using XCMS [3], where a feature is defined as a unique combination of a mass-to-charge (m/z) ratio and a retention time. Peak finding was performed with the centWave algorithm [4], and only peaks that fit a Gaussian shape were retained. Features were aligned across samples based on retention time and m/z value using the group.nearest function in XCMS; fillPeaks was used to reconsider features missed in the initial peak finding steps. CAMERA was used 1) to find compounds differing by adduct ion and stable isotope composition [5] and 2) to extract the intensities and m/z values for the associated MS/MS spectra.\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Chambers MC, Maclean B, Burke R, Amodei D, Ruderman DL, Neumann S, Gatto L, Fischer B, Pratt B, Egertson J, Hoff K, Kessner D, Tasman N, Shulman N, Frewen B, Baker TA, Brusniak MY, Paulse C, Creasy D, Flashner L, Kani K, Moulding C, Seymour SL, Nuwaysir LM, Lefebvre B, Kuhlmann F, Roark J, Rainer P, Detlev S, Hemenway T, Huhmer A, Langridge J, Connolly B, Chadick T, Holly K, Eckels J, Deutsch EW, Moritz RL, Katz JE, Agus DB, MacCoss M, Tabb DL, Mallick P.
