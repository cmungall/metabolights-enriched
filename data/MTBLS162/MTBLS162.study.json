                "description": "Evidence from several recent metabolomic studies suggests that increased concentrations of triacylglycerols (TAGs) with shorter (14-16 carbon atoms), saturated fatty acids are associated with insulin resistance and the risk of type 2 diabetes. Although causality cannot be inferred from association studies, patients in whom the primary cause of insulin resistance can be genetically defined, offer unique opportunities to address this challenge. Therefore, we compared metabolite profiles in patients with congenital lipodystrophy or loss-of-function insulin resistance (INSR) mutations with healthy controls. The absence of significant differences in TAG species in the INSR group suggest that changes previously observed in epidemiological studies are not purely a consequence of insulin resistance. The presence of TAGs with lower carbon numbers and high saturation in patients with lipodystrophy suggests that these metabolite changes may be associated with primary adipose tissue dysfunction. The observed pattern of TAG species is indicative of increased de novo lipogenesis (DNL). To test this we investigated the distribution of these TAGs in lipoprotein fractions using size exclusion chromatography prior to mass spectrometry. This associated these TAGs with VLDL particles, and hence release of TAGs into the blood from the liver. To test further the hepatic origin of these TAGs we induced DNL in the mouse, comparing ob/ob and wild type mice on a chow or high fat diet, confirming that DNL induced an increase in relatively shorter, more saturated fatty acids. Overall, these studies highlight DNL in the pathogenesis of metabolic dyslipidaemia in states where energy intake exceeds the capacity of adipose tissue.</p> The protocols and data for human samples are reported in the current study MTBLS162.</br> The protocols and data for mice samples are reported in the study MTBSL327.",

A total of 48 blood plasma samples were included, with the remaining positions of the 96-well plate occupied by either blanks or quality control (QC) samples. The samples, QC samples and blanks were placed in a pre-defined random order across the 96-well plate. For the QC samples, a pooled aliquot was created by mixing 10 \u00b5l of all samples to create the QC. Each plasma sample was placed into 1.2 ml Cryovials for the Flexus to sample. To each vial 100 \u00b5l of MilliQ water was added and thoroughly mixed. The solution (100 \u00b5l) was transferred to a glass coated 2.4 ml deep well plate (Plate+, Esslab, Hadleigh, UK). CH3OH (250 \u00b5l) was added containing six internal standards (0.6 \u00b5M 1,2-di-o-octadecyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocoline, 1.2 \u00b5M 1,2-di-O-phytanyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine, 0.6 \u00b5M C8-ceramide, 0.6 \u00b5M N-heptadecanoyl-D-erythro-sphingosylphosporylcholine, 6.2 \u00b5M undecanoic acid, 0.6 \u00b5M trilaurin), and then 500 \u00b5l of methyl tert-butyl ether was added and mixed. The plates were sealed using Corning aluminium microplate sealing tape (Sigma Aldrich, UK) and shaken for 10 min at 600 rpm, after which the plate was transferred to a centrifuge and spun for 10 min at 6000 rpm. Each well in the resulting plate had two layers, with an aqueous layer at the bottom and a hydrophobic layer on top containing the lipid extract. A 96-head micro-dispenser (Hydra Matrix, Thermo Fisher Ltd, Hemel Hampstead, UK) was used to transfer 25 \u00b5l of the hydrophobic layer to a glass-coated 25 \u00b5l low well plate (Plate+, Esslab, Hadleigh, UK) and with 90 \u00b5l of 7.5 mM NH4Ac IPA:MeOH (2:1) using a Hydra Matrix, after which the plate was sealed using Corning aluminium microplate sealing tape (Sigma Aldrich, UK) and stored at -20 \u00b0C until analysis.",

The Nanomate infusion mandrel was used to pierce the seal of each well before analysis, after which a fresh tip was pre-wetted by three repeat mixes of 6.5 \u00b5l of the sample and 5 \u00b5l was aspirated, followed by an air gap (1.5 \u00b5l). The tip was pressed against a fresh nozzle and the sample was dispensed using 0.3 psi nitrogen pressure. A voltage of 1.2 kV was used in positive mode and -1.5 kV in negative mode with an acquisition time of 72 s in both modes and a total analysis time of ~3 min per sample. The tip was discarded and replaced for each sample to minimise sample carry-over. Throughout the acquisition the sample plate was kept at 15 \u00b0C.",

This performed sample-specific mass re-calibration using predefined sets of internal standards and the removal of commonly present contaminant ions (often associated with plasticizers) with help of predefined rejection lists and mass defect filters. The raw data were converted to .mzXML (using MSconvert[2] with peakpick level 1), parsed with R and 50 (scan from 20 to 70) spectra were averaged per sample using XCMS[1], with a signal cutoff at 2000. The files were aligned using the XCMS[1][3] grouping function using \u201cmzClust\u201d with a m/z-window of 22 ppm and a minimum coverage of 60%, giving 1699 signals. Isotopes were annotated using the CAMERA package in R with the following parameters (maxcharge = 1, ppm = 5, mzabs = 0.001, intval = c(\u201cinto\u201d), minfrac = 0.25)[3].\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Smith CA, Want EJ, O'Maille G, Abagyan R, Siuzdak G.

Features of interest were subsequently confirmed using fragmentation experiments on a Thermo Velos Orbitrap mass analyser using an Advion Nanomate to directly infuse the lipid extract. The selected masses were isolated with a 1.5 m/z width in the linear ion trap and then fragmented using either linear ion trap with 35% relative collision energy or in the HCD (higher-energy collision-induced dissociation) collision cell, with a range of collision energies from 5% to 75% relative collision energy. All spectra were recorded in the Orbitrap set at 100,000 resolution.",
