                "description": "<p>Toxocariasis, mainly caused by <em>Toxocara canis</em>, and to a lesser extent, <em>Toxocara cati</em>, is a neglected parasitic zoonosis. The mechanisms that underlie the changes in lipid metabolism of <em>T. canis</em> infection in Beagle dogs' lungs remain unclear. Lipidomics is a rapidly emerging approach that enables the global profiling of lipid composition by mass spectrometry. In this study, we performed a non-targeted lipidomic analysis of the lungs of Beagle dogs infected with the roundworm <em>T. canis</em> using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). A total of 1197 lipid species were identified, of which 63, 88 and 157 lipid species were significantly altered at 24 h post-infection (hpi), 96 hpi and 36 days post-infection (dpi), respectively. This global lipidomic profiling identified infection-specific lipid signatures for lung toxocariasis, and represented a comprehensive comparison between the lipid composition of dogs' lungs in the presence and absence of <em>T. canis</em> infection. The potential roles of the identified lipid species in the pathogenesis of <em>T. canis</em> are discussed, which has important implications for better understanding the interaction mechanism between <em>T. canis</em> and the host lung.</p>",

The identified lipids were functionally annotated through the <strong>Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes</strong> (<strong>KEGG</strong>; <a href='https://www.genome.jp/kegg/' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>https://www.genome.jp/kegg/</a>) database to understand the functional properties of differential lipids and signal transduction pathways. The conversion of name between the lipid compounds acquired by LC-MS/MS and the <strong>KEGG</strong> ID in the <strong>KEGG</strong> database was conducted by <strong>MetaboAnalyst</strong> v.5.0 (<a href='https://www.metaboanalyst.ca/MetaboAnalyst/upload/ConvertView.xhtml' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>https://www.metaboanalyst.ca/MetaboAnalyst/upload/ConvertView.xhtml</a>) prior to the <strong>KEGG</strong> enrichment analysis<strong>[1]</strong>. Because multiple lipids with a specific function may correspond to the same <strong>KEGG</strong> ID, the conversion results were manually selected to march the correct <strong>KEGG</strong> ID and to determine the effect of altered lipids on the metabolic pathways.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Pang Z, Chong J, Zhou G, de Lima Morais DA, Chang L, Barrette M, Gauthier C, Jacques P\u00c9, Li S, Xia J.
