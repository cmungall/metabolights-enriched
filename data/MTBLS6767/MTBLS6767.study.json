                "description": "<p>Lipid, an important organic component in milk, has health benefits for newborns. Profiles of milk lipid in multi-species from multi-level haven\u2019t been accessible, therefore, we established a lipid subclass, lipid molecule, and fatty acid profile of 13 species to compare interspecific lipid differences. We used lipidomic to analysis the absolute content of lipid molecules based on UPLC-Orbitrap mass spectrometry system. The content of Zymosterol (ZyE) in all livestock was much higher than that in human milk. Meanwhile, the content of PI (18: 0_20: 5) and SM(d30:1) are only high in camels, which it might be used as potential biomarkers for the identification of camel milk. High content of ultra-long chain fatty acids (ULCFAs), as well as high content of DHA, ARA, EPA were found in pig milk. It is hoped that this comprehensive analysis of multi-species lipidomic can provide new macro insights into the development of the dairy industry.</p>",

In all species, milk samples were collected during paired lactation weeks after birth. At the end of each feeding or milking, the milk sample is removed and placed in the same 10 mL plastic container and immediately placed in a refrigerator at -20 \u00b0C for a short period of time, not exceeding 2 weeks. The samples are then transported in undefrosted dry ice and placed in a freezer at -80 \u00b0C for long-term storage, but for no more than 4 months.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ethical statements</strong></p><p>The Animal Welfare and Ethics Committee of Shenyang Agricultural University approved the participation of people and animals in this study.
