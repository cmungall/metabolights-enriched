                "description": "<p>Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) refers to nervous system damage caused by perinatal hypoxia, which is the major cause of long-term neuro-developmental disorders in surviving infants. However, the mechanisms still require further investigation. In this study, we found that the butanoate metabolism pathway exhibited significantly decreased and short chain fatty acid (SCFAs)-producing bacteria, especially butyrate-producing bacteria, were significantly decreased in fecal of neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain damage (HIBD) rats. Surprisingly, Sodium butyrate (SB) treatment could ameliorate pathological damage both in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus and facilitate recovery of SCFAs-producing bacteria related to metabolic pathways in neonatal HIBD rats. Moreover, we found that in samples from SB treatment neonatal HIBD rats cortex with high levels of butyrate acid along with aberrant key crotonyl-CoA-producing enzymes ACADS levels was observed compared HIBD rats. We also demonstrated that a decrease in histone 3-lysine 9-crotonylation (H3K9cr) downregulated expression of the HIE-related neurotrophic genes Bdnf, Gdnf, Cdnf, and Manf in HIBD rats. Furthermore, SB restored H3K9cr binding to HIE-related neurotrophic genes. Collectively, our results indicate that SB contributes to ameliorate pathological of HIBD by altering gut microbiota and brain SCFAs levels subsequently affecting histone crotonylation-mediated neurotrophic-related genes expression. This may be a novel microbiological approach for preventing and treating HIE.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Brain tissue metabolomics</strong>&nbsp;is reported in the current study&nbsp;<a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS4894' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS4894</strong></a>.</p><p><strong>Feces metabolomics</strong>&nbsp;is reported in&nbsp;<a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS4893' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS4893</strong></a>.</p>",

The samples were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C. QC sample was prepared by mixing aliquots of the all samples to be a pooled sample. An aliquot of the 120 \u03bcL supernatant was transferred to a glass sampling vial for vacuum-dry at room temperature. And 80 \u03bcL of methoxylamine hydrochloride (dissolved in pyridine, 15 mg/mL) was subsequently added. The resultant mixture was vortexed vigorously for 2 min and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 90 min.

The .<strong>abf</strong> data were imported into the <strong>MS-DIAL</strong> software for data processing. Metabolites were annotated through <strong>LUG</strong> database (untarget database of GC-MS from Lumingbio). After alignment with Statistic Compare component, the \u2018raw data array' (.txt) was obtained from raw data with the three-dimensional data sets including sample information, peak names (or retention time and m/z) and peak intensities. In the \u2018data array\u2019, all internal standards and any known pseudo positive peaks (caused by background noise, column bleed or BSTFA derivatization procedure) were removed. After RSD of the interior label &gt; 0.3 deleted, all peak strength (peak area) are processed by normalization of multi interior label according to retention time partition period. Data were transformed by log10, and the resulting data matrix were then imported into <strong>R</strong> ropls package. Principle component analysis (PCA) and (orthogonal) partial least-squares-discriminant analysis (O)PLS-DA were performed to visualize the metabolic difference among experimental groups, after mean centering and unit variance scaling. The Hotelling\u2019s T2 region, shown as an ellipse in score plots of the models, defines the 95% confidence interval of the modeled variation. Variable importance in the projection (VIP) ranks the overall contribution of each variable to the OPLS-DA model, and those variables with VIP &gt; 1 are considered relevant for group discrimination. In this study, the default 7-round cross-validation was applied with 1/7 of the samples being excluded from the mathematical model in each round, in order to guard against overfitting. The differential metabolites were selected on the basis of the combination of a statistically significant threshold of variable influence on projection (VIP) values obtained from the OPLS- DA model and p values from a two-tailed Student\u2019s t-test on the normalized peak areas from different groups, where metabolites with VIP values larger than 1.0 and p values less than 0.05 were considered as differential metabolites.</p>",
