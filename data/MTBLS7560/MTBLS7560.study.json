                "description": "<p class='ql-align-justify'>The gut microbiome has been associated with pathological neurophysiological evolvement in extremely premature infants suffering from brain injury. The exact underlying mechanism and its associated metabolic signatures in infants are not fully understood. To decipher metabolite profiles linked to neonatal brain injury, we investigated the longitudinal fecal and plasma metabolome of 51 extremely premature infants using LC-HRMS-based untargeted metabolomics. This was expanded by an investigation of bile acids and amidated bile acid conjugates in feces and plasma by LC-MS/MS-based targeted metabolomics. The resulting data was integrated with 16S rRNA gene amplicon gut microbiome profiles as well as patient cytokine, growth factor and T-cell profiles. We identified an early onset of differentiation in neuroactive metabolites and bile acids between infants with and without brain injury. We detected several bacterially-derived bile acid amino acid conjugates and secondary bile acids in the plasma already 3 days after delivery, indicating the early establishment of a metabolically active gut microbiome. These results give new insights into the early life metabolome of extremely premature infants.</p>",

Out of the cohort of 60 infants, 53 survived and 38 of the remaining infants displayed age-adequate MRIs or only mild brain injuries while 15 infants were diagnosed with severe pathological brain injuries. Out of those surviving infants, samples from 51 infants were available and used for this study (Figure 1A in the paper associated with this study). There was an almost equal gender distribution with 63% females in the control group and 53% females in the pathological group. Among the observed injuries were periventricular hemorrhagic infarctions, intraventricular hemorrhages, cerebellar hemorrhages and periventricular leukomalacia. A reduction of brain volume and an enlargement of the subarachnoid spaces was accompanying many of those injuries. Over the course of hospitalization and when possible, fecal samples were collected, and blood was drawn at multiple timepoints with a focus on day 3, day 7, day 28, correction week 32 and term equivalent age. The fecal samples from all extremely premature infants were collected from diapers via collection tubes and stored at -80 \u00b0C until further analysis. For minimizing the stress for patients, blood samples were only taken combined with clinical routine sampling. The blood samples were transferred into Lithium Heparin S-Monovettes and the plasma was separated and stored at -80 \u00b0C until further analysis.

                        "description": "<p>Thermo Fisher LC-HRMS(/MS) raw data files from the untargeted metabolomics measurements were converted into mzXML files, centroided and separated into 2 files according to polarity using ProteoWizard<strong>[1] </strong>(3.0.18). All experimental sampling timepoints from their respective biological matrix were processed together. Data pre-processing was done using the R (4.1) package XCMS<strong>[2]</strong> (3.14), starting with the import of the mzXML files. The next step was peak detection using the centWave algorithm (parameters: ppm = 5, peakwidth = 5/15; snthresh = 10, prefilter = 3/5000) followed by the removing of peaks with a too wide peak width. The retention time between samples were aligned employing the obiwarp algorithm (parameters: binSize = 0.6, distFun = 'cor_opt') with a previous alignment of pooled QC samples followed by the alignment of the samples. The detected peaks were grouped to features with a minimum threshold of 40% in at least one experimental group (parameters: bw = 1, minFraction = 0.4, minSamples = 5). Features missing a peak in certain samples were integrated in the respective retention time width of the feature. The resulting feature list was further processed by the R package CAMERA<strong>[3]</strong> (1.48) (parameters: perfwhm = 0.6, ppm = 5), creating adduct and isotopologue annotations. Features annotated as isotopologues and features with an adduct annotation different from [M+H] or [M-H] were removed from the feature list. In addition, features with a signal in the process blank or solvent blank higher than 20% of the median signal in the pooled QC were excluded. All features eluting in the void volume were also removed from the feature list (HILIC: 1 min, RP: 0.65 min). The python based package NeatMS<strong>[4]</strong> (0.9), based on neuronal networking, was used to classify the peak quality. Features mainly consisting of the peak label 'Noise'/'Low Quality' were filtered out. For each sampling timepoint a subset of the feature list was created and further processed. Features with more than 20% missing values were removed and the missing values were imputed by using half of the minimum value. Fold changes (log2) between groups were determined for each timepoint, and features within a threshold of 2 &lt; fold change log2 &lt; -2 were considered for further MS2 experiments and annotation. In addition to the untargeted evaluation, a targeted evaluation of the data obtained from the untargeted experiments was done using the software Skyline<strong>[5]</strong> (20.2), including compounds and features of high interest and/or compounds with an reference standard available. Feature annotation was carried out by in silico fragmentation employing SIRIUS 4<strong>[6]</strong> (parameter: 5 ppm; possible Ionizations [M-H]-, [M+Cl], [M+H]+, [M+Na]+; DB: Bio database), based on the received score and manual reviewing, and was expanded by comparing experimental MS2 spectra with spectral libraries using GNPS<strong>[7]</strong> (parameters: Score Threshold: 0.7, Precursor Ion Mass Tolerance: 0.05, Min Matched Peaks: 5) whenever possible. Features annotated by employing <em>in sillico</em> fragmentation were assigned an identification confidence level of 3, features with an unambiguous match in a spectral library with an identification confidence level of 2.a, while compounds with an identity confirmed by reference standards, were assigned an identification confidence level of 1<strong>[8]</strong>. The raw files obtained from the LC-MS/MS experiments targeting bile acids and their conjugates were also processed and quantified by Skyline (20.2). Fold changes (log2) between groups were determined and corresponding p-values were calculated using Wilcoxon Rank sum test. FDR was controlled using the 'qvalue'<strong>[9][10]</strong> (2.28) R package with a cutoff of &lt; 0.2. For a putative Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and over-representation analysis (ORA, mummichog<strong>[11]</strong>)) the 'MS Peaks to Pathways' tool from the web application MetaboAnalyst<strong>[12]</strong> (5.0) was used (parameters: p-value cutoff: 0.1, mummichog+GSEA, min. 5 entries, MFN DB). For this purpose, the data sets of the HILIC and the RP chromatography and positive and negative polarity mode were combined to one data set for each timepoint. Multivariate statistical analysis (PCA) was done using the R package 'MixOmics'<strong>[13]</strong> (6.20) on the autoscaled and combined data of both positive and negative polarity of RP and HILIC chromatography. Correlation analysis was done using the R package 'Hmisc'<strong>[14] </strong>(4.7) based on Spearman\u2019s correlation and for the PERMANOVA and dispersion analysis the R package 'vegan'<strong>[15]</strong> (2.3) was used.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Chambers MC, Maclean B, Burke R, Amodei D, Ruderman DL, Neumann S, Gatto L, Fischer B, Pratt B, Egertson J, Hoff K, Kessner D, Tasman N, Shulman N, Frewen B, Baker TA, Brusniak MY, Paulse C, Creasy D, Flashner L, Kani K, Moulding C, Seymour SL, Nuwaysir LM, Lefebvre B, Kuhlmann F, Roark J, Rainer P, Detlev S, Hemenway T, Huhmer A, Langridge J, Connolly B, Chadick T, Holly K, Eckels J, Deutsch EW, Moritz RL, Katz JE, Agus DB, MacCoss M, Tabb DL, Mallick P.
