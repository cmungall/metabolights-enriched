                "description": "<p><em>Anisakis simplex</em> are parasitic nematodes that cause anisakiasis. The possibility of infection with this parasite is through consumption of raw or undercooked fish products. <em>A. simplex</em> infections are often misdiagnosed, especially in subclinical cases that do not present with typical symptoms such as urticaria, angioedema and gastrointestinal allergy. The resulting allergic reactions range from rapid-onset and potentially fatal anaphylactic reactions to chronic, debilitating conditions. While there have been numerous published studies on the genomes and proteomes of <em>A. simplex</em>, less attention has been paid to the metabolomes. Metabolomics is concerned with the composition of metabolites in biological systems. Dynamic responses to endogenous and exogenous stimuli are particularly well suited for the study of holistic metabolic responses. In addition, metabolomics can be used to determine metabolic activity at different stages of development or during growth. In this study, we reveal for the first time the metabolomes of infectious stages (L3 and L4) of <em>A. simplex</em> using untargeted metabolomics by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. In the negative ionization mode (ESI-), we identified 172 different compounds, whereas in the positive ionization mode (ESI+), 186 metabolites were found. Statistical analysis showed that 60 metabolites were found in the ESI- mode with different concentration in each group, of which 21 were more enriched in the L3 larvae and 39 in the L4 stage of <em>A. simplex</em>. Comparison of the individual developmental stages in the ESI+ mode also revealed a total of 60 differential metabolites, but 32 metabolites were more enriched in the L3 stage larvae, and 28 metabolites were more concentrated in the L4 stage. The metabolomics study revealed that the developmental stages of <em>A. simplex</em> differed in a number of metabolic pathways, including nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism. In addition, molecules responsible for successful migration within their host, such as pyridoxine and prostaglandins (E1, E2, F1a) were present in the L4 stage. In contrast, metabolic pathways for amino acids, starch and sucrose were mainly activated in the L3 stage. Our results provide new insights into the comparative metabolome profiles of two different developmental stages of <em>A. simplex</em>.</p>",

                        "description": "<p>The raw LC-MS data were acquired and aligned using the Compound Discover v3.0 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) based on the m/z value and the retention time (RT) of the ion signals. The spectral data were normalized and auto scaled before statistical analysis. The data was introduced into the SIMCA-P software v14.1 (Santorius, Goettingen, Germany) for multivariate analysis. A Principal Components Analysis (PCA) was first used as an unsupervised method for data visualization and outlier identification<strong>[1]</strong>. Supervised regression modeling was performed on the data set by use of Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA). The quality of the models was evaluated with the relevant R2 and Q2. The importance of each ion in the PLS-DA was evaluated by variable importance in the projection (VIP) score<strong>[2][3]</strong>. The VIP score positively reflects the metabolite\u2019s influence on the classification, and metabolites with VIP &gt; 1 were considered important in the study.</p><p><br></p><p>The metabolites showing different concentrations among 2 given groups (DMs) were filtered and confirmed by combining the results of the multivariate analysis (VIP values &gt; 1.0) and the results of univariate analyses: t-test (p-value \u2264 0.05) and fold-change (FC) method (-1.5 \u2a7d Log2FC \u2a7d 1.5) for both ESI modes. Data were visualized on volcano plots.</p><p><br></p><p>In multivariate analyses, the hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) with Euclidean measured distance, and the average clustering algorithm was used to visualize the differences in the concentration of each statistically significant metabolites between samples groups in two different ESI modes. Subsequently, the metabolites assignment to the compounds groups and pathway enrichment analysis was performed using Metaboanalyst 5.0<strong>[4][5]</strong>. The enrichment overview was based on the KEGG database<strong>[6][7]</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p>Furthermore, the distribution of common and unique metabolites identified in the two ESI modes was analyzed and visualized using the Venn Diagrams tool (https://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/Venn/).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Yeshi K, Creek DJ, Anderson D, Ritmejeryt\u0117 E, Becker L, Loukas A, Wangchuk P.
