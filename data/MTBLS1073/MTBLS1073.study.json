                "description": "Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) replication requires host metabolism. Infection alters the activity in multiple metabolic pathways, including increasing fatty acid elongation and lipid synthesis. The virus-host interactions regulating the metabolic changes associated with replication are essential to infection. While multiple host factors, including kinases and transcription factors, have been identified to be important to metabolic changes that occurr following HCMV infection, little is known about the viral factors required to alter metabolism. The HCMV UL37x1 protein (pUL37x1) localizes to the mitochondria and ER and controls Ca2+ flux from the ER to the cytosol which may influence metabolism. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that pUL37x1 is important to the metabolic remodeling that is necessary for HCMV replication by using a combination of metabolomics, lipidomics, and metabolic tracers to measure fatty acid elongation. We observed that fibroblast cells infected with wild-type (WT) HCMV had similar levels of metabolites as those infected with a mutant virus lacking the UL37x1 gene, subUL37x1. However, we found that subUL37x1-infected cells had reduced levels of two host proteins that were previously demonstrated to be important for lipid metabolism during HCMV infection\u2014fatty acid elongase 7 (ELOVL7) and ER-stress related kinase PERK\u2014relative to WT-infected cells. Moreover, we observed that HCMV infection results in an increase in phospholipids with very long-chain fatty acid tails (PL-VLCFAs) that contain 26 or more carbons in one of their two tails. The levels of many PL-VLCFAs were lower in subUL37x1-infected cells compared to WT-infected cells. We also show that uninfected cells expressing a high-level of pUL37x1 have a greater amount of lipids relative to control cells. Overall, we conclude that although pUL37x1 is not necessary for network-wide metabolic changes occurring during infection, it is important to the remodeling of lipid metabolic pathways during HCMV infection.",

Lipids were extracted in parallel from 2 wells and independently analyzed (e.g. technical duplicates). The cells on the third well were counted. Samples were normalized according to total live cell number at the time of lipid extraction. Each sample was re-suspended in 125 \u00b5l of 1:1:1 solution per 100,000 cells. In parallel with the biological samples, the extraction procedure was performed on wells that lacked cells. These 'no cell' controls were used to determine contaminants that were removed from analysis. After re-suspension, the samples were immediately analyzed.</p>",

In positive mode, the NCE value was increased to 30. All lipids were ionized using a heated electrospray ionization (HESI) source. The following HESI parameters were used in negative mode: sheath gas flow rate = 44; auxiliary gas flow rate = 14; sweep gas flow rate = 2; spray voltage = 3.3 kV; S-lens RF =76; aux gas temp 220 \u02daC; and capillary temp = 320 \u02daC.
