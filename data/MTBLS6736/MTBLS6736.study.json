                "description": "<p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder characterized by hyperandrogenism, ovarian dysfunction and polycystic ovarian morphology. Gut microbiota dysbiosis and metabolite are associated with PCOS clinical parameters. Yulin Tong Bu formula (YLTB), a traditional Chinese medicine formula, has been recently indicated to be capable of ameliorating polycystic ovary symptoms and correcting abnormal glucose metabolism. However, the therapeutic mechanism of YLTB on PCOS has not been fully elucidated.</p><p><strong>METHODS:</strong> A pseudo sterile mouse model was established during this 4-day acclimatization phase by giving the animals an antibiotic cocktail to remove the gut microbiota. Here, the therapeutic effects of YLTB on PCOS were investigated using dehydroepiandrosterone plus high-fat diet induced PCOS mice model. Female prepuberal mice were randomly divided into 3 groups; namely, the control group, PCOS group and YLTB (38.68 g/kg/day) group. To test whether this effect is associated with the gut microbiota, we performed 16S rRNA sequencing studies to analyze the fecal microbiota of mice. The relationships among metabolites, gut microbiota and PCOS phenotypes were further explored by using Spearman correlation analysis. Then, the effect of metabolite ferulic acid was then validated in PCOS mice.</p><p><strong>RESULTS:</strong> Our results showed that YLTB treatment ameliorated PCOS features (ovarian dysfunction, delayed glucose clearance, decreased insulin sensitivity, deregulation of glucolipid metabolism and hormones, etc) and significantly attenuated PCOS gut microbiota dysbiosis. Spearman correlation analysis showed that metabolites such as ferulic acid and folic acid are negatively correlated with PCOS clinical parameters. The effect of ferulic acid was similar to that of YLTB. In addition, the bacterial species such as <em>Bacteroides dorei</em> and <em>Bacteroides fragilis</em> were found to be positively related to PCOS clinical parameters, using the association study analysis.</p><p><strong>CONCLUSION:</strong> These results suggest that YLTB treatment systematically regulates the interaction between the gut microbiota and the associated metabolites to ameliorate PCOS, providing a solid theoretical basis for further validation of YLTB effect on human PCOS trials.</p>",

The mice were maintained under standard circumstances (22-24 \u00b0C, 50% relative humidity, 12 h dark/light cycle) with unrestricted access to food and water. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Chongqing Medical University authorized all mouse experimental procedures (Chongqing, China). Mice were given 4 days to adjust to their new surroundings before being tested. A pseudo sterile mouse model was established during this 4-day acclimatization phase by giving the animals an antibiotic cocktail (ABX) to remove the gut microbiota. Freshly prepared antibiotic cocktail comprised 1 mg/mL ampicillin sodium (1146GR005, Biofroxx, Einhausen, Germany), 1 mg/mL neomycin sulfate (N814740-5G, MACKUN, Shanghai, China), 1 mg/mL metronidazole (M1547-5G, Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA), and 0.5 mg/mL vancomycin hydrochloride (1161GR1001, Biofroxx, Einhausen, Germany) in drinking water, and the mice were given autoclaved drinking water 4 days later.</p><p><br></p><p>According to the preliminary experiment, 30 mice were randomly divided into 6 groups (n = 5) to optimize the dosage of YLTB: control group, PCOS group, high dosage YLTB group [YLTB (H), 38.68 g/kg/day], medium dosage YLTB group [YLTB (M), 19.34 g/kg/day], low dosage YLTB group [YLTB (L), 9.67 g/kg/day], and metformin group (positive control, 250 mg/kg/day, D150959-5G, Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA). To establish the PCOS group, mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD, 60% kcal% fat; D12492, Research Diets, Inc., NB, USA) and received daily subcutaneous injections of DHEA ( 252805-10GM, Millipore, CA, USA; 60 mg/kg, dissolved in 0.1 mL of sesame oil)<strong>[1][2]</strong>. To determine the most effective YLTB dosage for PCOS, mice were fed an HFD, gavaged with various YLTB dosages and injected with DHEA on the same day. The control group was fed a normal chow diet (NCD) and injected daily with sesame oil (8008-74-0, Acros, BE, USA).</p><p><br></p><p>In order to verify the effects of high dose YLTB group on glucolipid metabolism, intestinal microbiota and fecal metabolism of PCOS mice, 30 mice were randomly divided into 3 groups (n = 10), namely, the control group, PCOS group and YLTB group (38.68 g/kg/day). To test the efficacy of the metabolite ferulic acid, 40 mice were randomly divided into 4 groups (n = 10), namely, the control group, PCOS group, FA1 group (50 mg/kg/day) and FA2 group (100 mg/kg/day)<strong>[3][4]</strong>. For FA groups, mice were fed an HFD and subcutaneously injected with DHEA daily, as well as administered ferulic acid (purity &gt; 99.00%, 128708, Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA, dissolved in lukewarm water) by oral gavage every day.</p><p><br></p><p>The mice mentioned above were all treated for 20 days. At the end of the experiment, mice were fasted over 12 h and anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of 10% chloral hydrate with 0.1 mL/10 g, and then weighed, measured to determine the distance from the tip of the nose to the anus, and tested for fasting blood glucose and oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs). The serum was collected and centrifuged for 20 min at 3000 rpm to measure insulin and sex hormones. The ovaries and uteri of mice were collected, weighed and wax-fixed or snap-frozen and stored at -80 \u00b0C for further use.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Fecal metabolic profiling</strong></p><p>The fecal pellets were collected in sterile cryopreservation tubes immediately after being discharged before sacrifice. Before analysis, the fecal samples were snap-frozen and stored at -80 \u00b0C.</p><p><br></p><p>Note: C: Mice were fed a normal chow diet (NCD) and injected daily with sesame oil; P: Mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) and received daily subcutaneous injections of DHEA (60 mg/kg, dissolved in 0.2 mL of sesame oil); PG: Mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD), gavaged with various YLTB dosages and injected with DHEA on the same day.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Wang M, Zhao D, Xu L, Guo W, Nie L, Lei Y, Long Y, Liu M, Wang Y, Zhang X, Zhang L, Li H, Zhang J, Yuan D, Yue L.
