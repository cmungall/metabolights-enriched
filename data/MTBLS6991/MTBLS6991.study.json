The first reported isolates of the SAR11 freshwater clade LD12 and a member of the sister clade IIIa from the same region are now available. This project quantifed concentrations of select, known intracellular metabolites within two strains of SAR11: LSUCC0261 and LSUCC0530.",

The pieces of the filter were placed in an 8 ml combusted amber glass vial and 1 ml of -20 \u00b0C 40:40:20 acetonitrile:methanol:water + 0.1 M formic acid was added to each vial. 25 \u00b5l of 1 \u00b5g/ml deuterated standard mix (d3-glutamic acid, d4-4-hydroxybenzoic acid, and d5-taurocholate) were added to act as extraction recovery standards. The vials were vortexed to shake apart filter pieces and fully expose them to the ice-cold solvent. They were sonicated for 10 min and the extract was transferred to micro-centrifuge tubes using Pasteur pipettes. The filter pieces were rinsed 3x with 500 \u00b5l of extraction solvent and the rinse was added to the eppendorf tubes. The extracts were centrifuged at 20,000 x g for 5 min. The supernatant was transferred to new 8 ml amber glass vials leaving behind any scraps of filter or pieces of cellular detritus. The extracts were neutralized with 51.2 \u00b5l of 6 M ammonium hydroxide and dried down in a vacufuge. The samples were reconstituted in 100 \u00b5l labeled injection mix (95:5 water:acetonitrile containing D2 biotin, D6 succinic acid, D4 cholic acid, and D7 indole 3 acetic acid).
