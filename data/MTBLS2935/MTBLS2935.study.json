                "description": "<p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> Novel biomarkers are urgently needed to distinguish between benign and malignant thyroid nodules and detect thyroid cancer in the early stage. The associations between serum IgG N-glycosylation and thyroid cancer risk have been revealed. We aimed to explore the potential of IgG N-glycan traits as biomarkers in the differential diagnosis of thyroid cancer.</p><p><strong>METHODS:</strong> Plasma IgG N-glycome analysis was applied to a discovery cohort followed by independent validation. IgG N-glycan profiles were obtained using a robust quantitative strategy based on matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. IgG N-glycans were relatively quantified, and classification performance was evaluated based on directly detected and derived glycan traits.</p><p><strong>RESULTS: </strong>Four directly detected glycans were significantly changed in thyroid cancer patients compared to that in non-cancer controls. Derived glycan traits and a classification glycol-panel were generated based on the directly detected glycan traits. In the discovery cohort, derived trait BN (bisecting type neutral N-glycans) and the glyco-panel showed potential in distinguishing between thyroid cancer and non-cancer controls with AUCs of 0.920 and 0.917, respectively. The diagnostic potential was further validated. Derived trait BN and the glycol-panel displayed \u201caccurate\u201d performance (AUC&gt;0.8) in discriminating thyroid cancer from benign thyroid nodules and healthy controls in the validation cohort. Meanwhile, derived trait BN and the glycol-panel also showed diagnostic potential in detecting early-stage thyroid cancer.</p><p><strong>CONCLUSIONS:</strong> IgG N-glycome analysis revealed N-glycomic differences that allow classification of thyroid cancer from non-cancer controls. Our results suggested that derived trait BN and the classification glyco-panel rather than single N-glycans may serve as candidate biomarkers for further validation.</p>",

The discovery cohort was consisted of healthy controls (HC) and patients with thyroid cancer (TC), while the validation cohort included three groups of participants: HC, patients with benign thyroid nodules (BTN) and patients with TC. The subgroups were age- and sex-matched as far as possible in each cohort. Healthy cases were defined by medical doctors according to eligibility criteria. HC should have no history of systematic diseases and have normal thyroid ultrasound, thyroid function, and biochemical parameters. Patients with benign and malignant TN were diagnosed on the basis of ultrasound and FNA and were confirmed by surgical histopathology. All patients with TC were clinically classified as PTC. We obtained approval from the regional ethics committee of Peking Union Medical College Hospital and informed written consents from all participants were acquired.</p>",

IgG was purified from each plasma sample as previously described<strong>[1]</strong>. Briefly, 70 \u00b5L of blood plasma was first diluted using Protein A IgG Binding Buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 0.5 L). The diluted samples were applied to the Spin plate wells and washed five times by Binding Buffer to thoroughly wash away all unbound non-IgG protein components. Last, the bound IgG was eluted by Elution Buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, 0.5 L) three times into three separate collection plates. In order to determine which fractions contained IgG, the absorbance was measured for each fraction at 280 nm by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) test (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 1 L). The purity of eluted IgG was validated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The fractions containing IgG were stored at -20 \u00b0C until the release of N-glycans.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>IgG N-Glycans Release and Enrichment:</strong></p><p>In total, 50 \u00b5L of denatured IgG-containing fractions of Protein A column elution were used for N-glycans release. According to the protocols of our previous publications<strong>[1][2]</strong>, IgG N-glycans were released by mixing the IgG elution with PNGase F (New England Biolabs, Inc., USA) followed by 12 h incubation at 37 \u00b0C. IgG N-glycans were enriched and purified from the enzyme solution by using a PGC-containing 96-well plate as described previously<strong>[1][2]</strong>. In brief, the PGC-containing 96-well plate was first conditioned with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in 80% acetonitrile (ACN), followed by 0.1% TFA in H2O. The solution of the enzyme-released glycans was subsequently loaded to the PGC-containing 96-well plate three times to allow complete N-glycans binding. Then the plate was washed with H2O to remove the salts and other contaminants. The N-glycans derived from IgG were finally eluted into the collection plate using 0.05% TFA in 25% ACN.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Ren S, Zhang Z, Xu C, Guo L, Lu R, Sun Y, Guo J, Qin R, Qin W, Gu J.

Of note, if multiple cation adduct signals such as [M + Na]+ and [M + K]+ were present simultaneously, all these related adducts should be included in the quantification<strong>[3]</strong>. Detailed information on glycan identification was provided in the <strong>Supplemental Information</strong> in the paper associated with this study. The intensities for the putative N-glycan structures were finally extracted as background-corrected area for each spectrum of the samples using <strong>MassyTools</strong>. Derived glycan traits including Gal-ratio (representing the level of IgG galactosylation), fucosylation (F), agalactosylation (agal), and bisecting type neutral N-glycans (BN) were calculated based on the same structural features. A glyco-panel was constructed by combining altered detected N-glycans between cases and controls through logistic regression in <strong>SPSS</strong> (version 19.0). In this process, the group was set as the dependent variable, and the altered glycan traits were set as concomitant variables. Prediction probability generated during the logistical regression process was defined as glyco-panel. The following statistical analyses were performed with <strong>GraphPad Prism 7</strong> and <strong>SPSS</strong>. Data quality was assessed and controlled by the inclusion of 6 technical replicates of a standard plasma sample and calculating the average value, standard deviation (SD), and the relative SD (CV) for all detected glycans. The diagnostic potential of the IgG N-glycans detected in the present study was assessed by performing statistical tests and receiver-operator-characteristics (ROC) analysis. Differences between two biological groups were assessed using the Mann-Whitney U test (non-normally distributed data), and the significance threshold of p-values is 0.004 (= p-value of 0.05 after multiple testing correction for 12 glycan traits). Differences between the three groups were evaluated by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons using <strong>GraphPad Prism 7</strong>. Glycan traits resulting in statistically significant p-values were further evaluated by ROC tests to assess the specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy of the candidate IgG N-glycans using <strong>GraphPad Prism 7</strong>. The significance of the generated values of area-under-the-curve (AUC) was assigned. If the AUC values were greater than 0.9, the tests were considered \u201chighly accurate,\u201d while values between 0.8 and 0.9 were deemed \u201caccurate.\u201d When the AUC values were between 0.7 and 0.8, the tests were concluded to be \u201cmoderately accurate\u201d. An \u201cuninformative\u201d test resulted in an AUC value that was between 0.5 and 0.7<strong>[3][4]</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Jansen BC, Reiding KR, Bondt A, Hipgrave Ederveen AL, Palmblad M, Falck D, Wuhrer M.
