                "description": "The exposome, defined as the cumulative measure of external exposures and associated biological responses throughout the lifespan, has emerged in recent years as a cornerstone in biomedical sciences. Metabolomics stands out here as one of the most powerful tools for investigating the interplay between the genetic background, exogenous, and endogenous factors within human health. However, to address the complexity of the exposome, novel methods are needed to characterize the human metabolome. In this work, we have optimized and validated a multianalyte metabolomics platform for large-scale quantitative exposome research in plasma and urine samples, based on the use of simple extraction methods and high-throughput metabolomic fingerprinting. The methodology enables, for the first time, the simultaneous characterization of the endogenous metabolome, food-related metabolites, pharmaceuticals, household chemicals, environmental pollutants, and microbiota derivatives, comprising more than 1000 metabolites in total. This comprehensive and quantitative investigation of the exposome is achieved in short run times, through simple extraction methods requiring small-sample volumes, and using integrated quality control procedures for ensuring data quality. This metabolomics approach was satisfactorily validated in terms of linearity, recovery, matrix effects, specificity, limits of quantification, intraday and interday precision, and carryover. Furthermore, the clinical potential of the methodology was demonstrated in a dietary intervention trial as a case study. In summary, this study describes the optimization, validation, and application of a multimetabolite platform for comprehensive and quantitative metabolomics-based exposome research with great utility in large-scale epidemiological studies.",

Standards of analytical purity for 639 metabolites and 14 internal standards (ISs) were obtained from various commercial sources, while 37 food metabolites were synthesized in-house, as detailed elsewhere (see <strong>Table S1</strong> in the paper associated with this study)<strong>[1],[2]</strong>. Individual stock solutions for all 690 compounds were prepared at concentrations of 10 000 mg/L for endogenous metabolites or 1000 mg/L for exogenous ones and ISs, using the solvent recommended by the supplier and/or literature, and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. From these stock solutions, 3 multi-metabolite working solutions were prepared at 50 mg/L in water:- acetonitrile (80:20 (v/v)), and these were employed to build the calibration curves by serial dilution and to prepare spiked urine/plasma samples for validation purposes. We also prepared a fourth working solution by combining a set of 13 ISs, depicting the broad chemical diversity of the metabolite classes assayed (see <strong>Table S1</strong> in the paper associated with this study). To optimize the extraction conditions and method validation, we employed anonymized pooled samples of urine and plasma collected in previous studies from healthy volunteers after 1 week of a low polyphenol diet<strong>[3]</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1] </strong>Gonz\u00e1lez-Dom\u00ednguez R, Urpi-Sarda M, J\u00e1uregui O, Needs PW, Kroon PA, Andr\u00e9s-Lacueva C.

The extraction recovery was determined by spiking blank urine/plasma samples at three concentration levels (1, 100, 1000 \u03bcg/L), which were analyzed in triplicate. Recovery percentages were calculated considering the endogenous levels found in blank samples using the following formula:</p><p><br></p><p>recovery (%) = (final concentration - initial concentration)/ added concentration \u00d7 100 . </p><p><br></p><p>To assess matrix effects (ME), we compared the MS response of standards dissolved in solvent and extracted urine/plasma at the same concentration level (1, 100, 1000 \u03bcg/L). Method specificity was evaluated by testing the absence of interferences in blank solvents and extraction blanks, and by computing the retention time variability in solvent, blank urine/plasma and spiked urine/plasma along a 3-day analysis sequence. The limits of quantification (LOQ) were estimated in spiked urine/ plasma samples as the lowest concentration giving an average signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio of &gt;10, measurable with an imprecision of &lt;20%. These values were calculated by subtracting the analyte response observed in nonspiked samples. Intraday and interday precisions were evaluated by analyzing spiked urine/plasma samples at three concentration levels (1, 100, 1000 \u03bcg/L) five times within the same day, as well as on three consecutive days, respectively. Carryover was tested by analyzing blank water after injecting urine/plasma spiked at a concentration of 1000 \u03bcg/L.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER).&nbsp;<em>Guidance for Industry: Bioanalytical Method Evaluation</em>,&nbsp;2001</p>",
