                "description": "Fusarium graminearum and related species commonly infest grains causing the devastating plant disease Fusarium head blight (FHB) and the formation of trichothecene mycotoxins. The most relevant toxin is deoxynivalenol (DON), which acts as a virulence factor of the pathogen. FHB is difficult to control and resistance to this disease is a polygenic trait, mainly mediated by the quantitative trait loci (QTL) Fhb1 and Qfhs.ifa-5A. In this study we established a targeted GC-MS based metabolomics workflow comprising a standardized experimental setup for growth, treatment and sampling of wheat ears and subsequent GC-MS analysis followed by data processing and evaluation of QC measures using tailored statistical and bioinformatics tools. This workflow was applied to wheat samples of six genotypes with varying levels of Fusarium resistance, treated with either DON or water, and harvested 0, 12, 24, 48 and 96 hours after treatment. The results suggest that the primary carbohydrate metabolism and transport, the citric acid cycle and the primary nitrogen metabolism of wheat are clearly affected by DON treatment. Most importantly significantly elevated levels of amino acids and derived amines were observed. In particular, the concentrations of the three aromatic amino acids phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan increased. No clear QTL specific difference in the response could be observed except a generally faster increase in shikimate pathway intermediates in genotypes containing Fhb1. The overall workflow proved to be feasible and facilitated to obtain a more comprehensive picture on the effect of DON on the central metabolism of wheat.",

Treated ears were sampled either directly after treatment (time point 0) or 12, 24, 48 and 96 hr after treatment. The ear was cut from the plant and the non-treated spikelets were removed by clipping the rachis with a surgical scissor below and above the treated spikelets. The treated ear part including the rachis and complete spikelets (chaff and florets) was put in a small vial. Harvested samples were immediately quenched in liquid nitrogen and subsequently stored at -80 \u00b0C until further processing. Each of the frozen wheat samples were milled to a fine powder for 2 min at 30 Hz using a ball mill (MM301 Retsch, Germany) with liquid nitrogen pre-cooled 10 ml stainless steel vessels and a 9-mm stainless steel ball.",

Metabolites were identified by comparison of mass spectra and retention indices to the spectra library using a cut-off value of 70%. The feature areas of three specific fragment ions were recorded for each metabolite and the ion with the highest signal to noise ratio was detected by an in-house, Python based software, and chosen for further data processing and comparative quantification in all samples.",
