                "description": "<p>Rhamnolipids (RLs), glycolipids biosynthesized by the <em>Pseudomonas</em> and <em>Burkholderia</em> genera, are known to display various activities against a wide range of pathogens. Most previous studies on RLs focused on their direct antimicrobial activity, while only a few reports described the mechanisms by which RLs induce resistance against phytopathogens and the related fitness cost on plant physiology. Here, we combined transcriptomic and metabolomic approaches to unravel the mechanisms underlying RL-induced resistance in wheat against the hemibiotrophic fungus <em>Zymoseptoria tritici</em>, a major pathogen of this crop. Investigations were carried out by treating wheat plants with a bioinspired synthetic mono-RL with a 12-carbon fatty acid tail, dodecanoyl \u03b1/\u03b2-L-rhamnopyranoside (Rh-Est-C12), under both infectious and non-infectious conditions to examine its potential wheat defense-eliciting and priming bioactivities. Whereas, Rh-Est-C12 conferred to wheat a significant protection against <em>Z. tritici</em> (41% disease severity reduction), only a slight effect of this RL on wheat leaf gene expression and metabolite accumulation was observed. A subset of 24 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 11 differentially accumulated metabolites (DAMs) was scored in elicitation modalities 2, 5 and 15 days post-treatment (dpt), and 25 DEGs and 17 DAMs were recorded in priming modalities 5 and 15 dpt. Most changes were down-regulations, and only a few DEGs and DAMs associated with resistance to pathogens were identified. Nevertheless, a transient early regulation in gene expression was highlighted at 2 dpt (e.g., genes involved in signaling, transcription, translation, cell-wall structure and function), suggesting a perception of the RL by the plant upon treatment. Further <em>in vitro</em> and <em>in planta</em> bioassays showed that Rh-Est-C12 displays a significant direct antimicrobial activity toward <em>Z. tritici</em>. Taken together, our results suggest that Rh-Est-C12 confers protection to wheat against <em>Z. tritici</em> through direct antifungal activity and, to a lesser extent, by induction of plant defenses without causing major alterations in plant metabolism. This study provides new insights into the modes of action of RLs on the wheat-<em>Z. tritici</em> pathosystem and highlights the potential interest in Rh-Est-C12, a low-fitness cost molecule, to control this pathogen.</p>",

                        "description": "<p><strong>Bioinspired Rhamnolipid Synthesis</strong></p><p>The Rhamnolipid (RL) used in the present study (dodecanoyl \u03b1/\u03b2-L-rhamnopyranoside, hereafter referred to as Rh-Est-C12) is bioinspired from the RLs naturally produced by <em>P. aeruginosa </em>and was synthesized as described previously<strong>[1][2]</strong>. The conversion and the purity of the product was assessed using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and confirmatory analyses were performed using elemental analysis (vario MICRO cube CHNS/O, Elementar, Lyon, France) and NMR spectroscopy (NMR, Bruker 400 MHz spectrometer). Briefly, chemical analysis of the obtained molecule Rh-Est-C12 consists of: yellowish oil (\u03b2/\u03b1 ratio 3:7); Rf 0.48 (AcOEt/MeOH 9/1); 1H NMR (CDCl3): 5.09-4.77 (m, 2H), 4.06-3.87 (m, 4H), 3.66-3.59 (m, 2H), 3.48-3.41 (m, 2H), 2.40-2.33 (m, 4H), 1.65-1.58 (m, 4H), 1.30-1.25 (m, 38H), 0.92 (m, 6H, CH3) 13C NMR (CDCl3): \u03b4 174.7, 172.0, 93.5, 92.8, 75.9, 74.2, 73.4, 72.6, 71.3, 69.9, 68.7, 68.1, 34.4, 34,3, 32.0-21.6 (CH2 alkyl chain), 17.6, 17.4, 13.6. The molecular weight of the obtained molecule is 346 g/mol.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Plant and Fungal Materials</strong></p><p>The experiments were conducted using seeds of the wheat cultivar (cv.) Alixan, susceptible to <em>Z. tritici</em>, provided by the breeding company Limagrain Europe (Verneuil l\u2019Etang, France). All <em>in vitro</em> and <em>in planta</em> bioassays were carried out using the pathogenic <em>Z. tritici</em> single-spore strain T02596, isolated in 2014 in Northern France from a wheat field non-treated with fungicides. Since its isolation, the strain was stored in cryotube aliquots at -80 \u00b0C to avoid genetic drift of the strain due to <em>in vitro</em> subcultures. The fungal inoculum was produced by growing the strain on potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium during one week in dark conditions at 20 \u00b0C.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Plant Treatment and Infection</strong></p><p>Wheat seeds were first pregerminated in square Petri dishes (12 x 12 cm) on moist filter paper, as described previously<strong>[3]</strong>, before being transferred into 3 L pots filled with universal loam (Gamm Vert, France) and placed in the greenhouse at 21 \u00b1 2 \u00b0C with a 16/8 h day-night cycle. In total 3 pots of 12 wheat plants each (n=36) were used as replicates for each modality. After 3 weeks of plant growth, i.e., when the third leaves were fully expanded (corresponding to day 0, D0), plants were pretreated with Rh-Est-C12 at 500 mg/L or with a mock treatment as control, using a hand sprayer. A volume of 30 mL was used to treat each pot. Rh-Est-C12 was firstly dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, Sigma-Aldrich, Saint-Louis, USA), with a final concentration of DMSO of 0.1 % in the treatment solution, supplemented with 0.05% of polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate (Tween 20, Sigma-Aldrich, Saint-Louis, USA) as a wetting agent. Mock treatment consisted of a solution of 0.1% DMSO supplemented with 0.05% of Tween 20. At 2 days post-treatment (D2), both RL-treated and mock-treated plants were inoculated by spraying 30 mL of 106 spores/mL <em>Z. tritici</em> suspension supplemented with a 0.05 % Tween 20 solution. Non-inoculated plants were mock-inoculated by spraying 30 mL of a 0.05 % Tween 20 solution on the plants of each pot. After inoculation, the plants were covered with a clear polyethylene bag for 3 days, to ensure a high humidity level on the surface of the leaves, a required condition for the disease development. Disease severity level was scored on the plant third leaf at 23 days after treatment (D23), corresponding to 21 days post-inoculation, by assessing the leaf areas covered by lesions (chlorosis and necrosis) bearing or not pycnidia.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1] </strong>Robineau M, Le Guenic S, Sanchez L, Chaveriat L, Lequart V, Joly N, Calonne M, Jacquard C, Declerck S, Martin P, Dorey S, Ait Barka E.

Besides, the proposed putative metabolite identifications were based on expertized analysis of the corresponding mass spectra and comparison with published reports in literature. Based on accurate mass measurements, elemental compositions were calculated, filtered by isotope abundance and electron parity, and checked for consistency in relation to elemental compositions calculated for fragment ions and observed neutral losses. Additional information was retrieved from the <strong>KEGG</strong> and <strong>PubChem</strong> databases. The identity of some metabolites was confirmed using the corresponding standards provided by Sigma-Aldrich (France). Differential metabolomic analyses among the different conditions were performed using the Tukey's Honest Significant Difference method followed by a false discovery rate (FDR) correction using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. Metabolites of interest were considered differentially accumulated when the false discovery rate was below 5 % (FDR &lt; 0.05).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> de Bruijn WJ, Vincken JP, Duran K, Gruppen H.
