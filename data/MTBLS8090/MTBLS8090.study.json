                "description": "The alteration of metabolism is essential for the initiation and progression of numerous types of cancer, including colorectal cancer (CRC). Metabolomics has been used to study CRC. At present, the reprogramming of the metabolism in CRC remains to be fully elucidated. In the present study, comprehensive untargeted metabolomics analysis was performed on the paired CRC tissues and adjacent normal tissues from patients with CRC (n=35) using ultra\u2011high\u2011performance liquid chromatography\u2011mass spectrometry. Subsequently, bioinformatic analysis was performed on the differentially expressed metabolites. The changes in these differential metabolites were compared among groups of patients based on sex, anatomical tumor location, grade of tumor differentiation and stage of disease. A total of 927 metabolites were detected in the tissue samples, and 24 metabolites in the CRC tissue were significantly different compared with the adjacent normal tissue. The present study revealed that the levels of three amino acid metabolites were increased in the CRC tissue, specifically, N\u2011\u03b1\u2011acetyl\u2011\u03b5\u2011(2\u2011propenal)\u2011Lys, cyclo(Glu\u2011Glu) and cyclo(Phe\u2011Glu). The metabolites with decreased levels in the CRC tissue included quinaldic acid (also referred to as quinoline\u20112\u2011carboxilic acid), 17\u03b1\u2011 and 17\u03b2\u2011estradiol, which are associated with tumor suppression activities, as well as other metabolites such as, anhydro\u2011\u03b2\u2011glucose, Asp\u2011Arg, lysophosphatidylcholine, lysophosphatidylethanolamine (lysoPE), lysophosphatidylinositol, carnitine, 5'\u2011deoxy\u20115'\u2011(methylthio) adenosine, 2'\u2011deoxyinosine\u20115'\u2011monophosphate and thiamine monophosphate. There was no difference in the levels of the differential metabolites between male and female patients. The differentiation of CRC also showed no impact on the levels of the differential metabolites. The levels of lysoPE were increased in the right side of the colon compared with the left side of the colon and rectum. Analysis of the different tumor stages indicated that 2\u2011aminobenzenesulfonic acid, P\u2011sulfanilic acid and quinoline\u20114\u2011carboxylic acid were decreased in stage\u00a0I CRC tissue compared with stage\u00a0II,\u00a0III\u00a0and\u00a0IV CRC tissue. The levels of N\u2011\u03b1\u2011acetyl\u2011\u03b5\u2011(2\u2011propenal)\u2011Lys, methylcysteine and 5'\u2011deoxy\u20115'\u2011(methylthio) adenosine varied at different stages of tumorigenesis. These differential metabolites were implicated in multiple metabolism pathways, including carbohydrate, amino acid, lipid, nucleotide and hormone. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that CRC tumors had altered metabolites compared with normal tissue. The data from the metabolic profile of CRC tissues in the present study provided supportive evidence to understand tumorigenesis.",

Briefly, tissue samples (<strong>20 \u00b5g</strong>) were thawed on ice for 30 min. The metabolite extraction procedure was carried out as follows: A total of <strong>400 \u00b5L 70% methanol-water</strong> and internal standards (<strong>IS</strong>) extractant were added to each sample, the mixture was vortexed for 2 min, frozen in liquid nitrogen for 5 min, placed on dry ice for 5 min, and then thawed on ice for 5 min. After the sample was vortexed for 2 min, it was inverted 3 times, then centrifuged at 16,113.6 x g at 4 \u00b0C for 10 min. Subsequently, 300 \u00b5L of the supernatant was transferred to a new tube and stored at -20 \u00b0C for 30 min to precipitate proteins to avoid any interference of the proteins in the analytic procedure. After a final centrifugation at 16,113.6 x g at 4 \u00b0C for 3 min, 200 \u00b5L supernatant was collected for analysis by <strong>Allwegene Technology Co., Ltd</strong>. The following <strong>IS</strong> were added in a concentration of 1 \u00b5g/mL: L-2-chlorophenylalanine, (2H3)-L-Carnitine HCl, 4-Fluoro-L-\u03b1-phenylglycine, L-Phenylalanine (2\u201313C, 99%), (2H5)-Hippuric acid, (2H5)-Kynurenic acid and (2H5)-Phenoxy acetic acid.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1] </strong>R\u00f6misch-Margl, W., Prehn, C., Bogumil, R., R\u00f6hring, C., Suhre, K., Adamski, J. 2012.
