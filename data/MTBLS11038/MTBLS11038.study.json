After homogenizing for 5 min using TissueLyser (JXFSTPRP, China), samples were then sonicated for 10 min and incubate at - 20 \u00b0C for 1 h. Samples were centrifuged for 15 min at 25,000 rpm at 4 \u00b0C, and the supernatant was then transferred for vacuum freeze drying. The metabolites were resuspended in 200 \u00b5L of 10% methanol and sonicated for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C, after centrifuging for 15 min at 25,000 rpm, and the supernatants were transferred to autosampler vials for LC-MS analysis. A quality control (QC) sample was prepared by pooling the same volume of each sample to evaluate the reproducibility of the whole LC-MS analysis.</p>",
