                "description": "<h4>Introduction</h4>Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHCys) is an independent risk factor for various diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, Alzheimer's, and cancers. Folate deficiency is one of the significant reasons for HHCys. However, it is not known whether folate deficiency with HHCys is associated with any serum metabolites.<h4>Objectives</h4>Our objective was to identify the metabolic alterations in people having folate deficiency with HHCys and check whether a short-term folic acid therapy could reverse those metabolic changes.<h4>Methods</h4>The study enrolled 34 participants aged between 18 and 40 years having folate deficiency (<\u20094.6 ng/mL) with HHCys (>\u200915 \u03bcmol/L) and 21 normal healthy individuals. A short-term intervention of oral folic acid (5 mg/day) was done in the HHCys group for 30 days. Untargeted metabolomics analysis of serum was performed in all study subjects before and after the folic acid treatment. Different univariate methods and the multivariable-adjusted linear regression models were employed to determine an association between homocysteine level and metabolite profile.<h4>Results</h4>Metabolomics analysis data showed that many metabolites involved in the biochemical pathways of lipid metabolisms such as polyunsaturated fatty acids, glycerolipids, and phospholipids were downregulated in the HHCys group. Short-term oral folic acid therapy significantly reduced their serum homocysteine level. However, the metabolic pathway alterations observed in folate-deficient HHCys-condition were unaltered even after the folic acid treatment.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our study revealed that people who have a folic acid deficiency with HHCys have an altered metabolite profile related to lipid metabolism, which cannot be reversed by short-term folic acid therapy.",

All the participants were informed of the objectives of the study, and their consent to participate in the study was obtained. The serum folate level of less than 4.6 ng/mL was defined as folate deficiency in our research. The serum HCys level of higher than 15 \u03bcmol/L was defined as HHCys<strong>[1]</strong>. The study included both men and women aged between 18 and 40 yrs, BMI not greater than 25 kg/m2 , and fasting blood sugar (FBS) not higher than 100 mg/dL. People who have a history of gastrointestinal surgery, chronic diseases, smoking or regular drug use or alcoholism, vitamin, amino acid, or protein supplementation, or chronic consumption of a high protein diet or any known illness were excluded from the study. The study recruited 34 participants having folate deficiency with HHCys and 21 normal healthy individuals. Participants have been recruited from Pathanamthitta district in Kerala, India. Study participants with HHCys were supplemented with a daily oral dose of 5 mg folic acid (a vitamin supplement) for 30 days. Samples were collected at the fasting state from all study subjects during the morning to minimize the circadian component of metabolite expression. Whole blood was collected into tubes (Safelab Fluoride Oxalate Tubes) without anticoagulant for the separation of serum. The collected serum samples were used for the estimation of fasting blood glucose, cholesterol, Serum Iron, Serum ferritin, homocysteine, and serum folate. The remaining serum samples were stored at \u2212 20 \u00b0C freezer for further analysis.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Tinelli C, Di Pino A, Ficulle E, Marcelli S, Feligioni M.
