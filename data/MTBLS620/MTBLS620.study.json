                "description": "Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is one of the most prevalent autoimmune diseases among children in Western countries. Earlier metabolomics studies suggest that T1D is preceded by dysregulation of lipid metabolism. Here we used a lipidomics approach to analyze molecular lipids in a prospective series of 428 plasma samples from 40 children who progressed to T1D (PT1D), 40 children who developed at least a single islet autoantibody but did not progress to T1D during the follow-up (P1Ab) and 40 matched controls (CTR). Sphingomyelins were found to be persistently downregulated in PT1D when compared to the P1Ab and CTR groups. Triacylglycerols and phosphatidylcholines were mainly downregulated in PT1D as compared to P1Ab at the age of 3 months. Our study suggests that children who progressed to islet autoimmunity or overt T1D are characterized by distinct lipidomic signatures, which may be helpful in the identification of at-risk children before the initiation of autoimmunity.",

The DIPP study has screened more than 220,000 newborn infants for HLA-conferred susceptibility to T1DM in 3 university hospitals Turku, Tampere, and Oulu in Finland. The subjects involved in the current study were chosen from the subset of DIPP children from the city of Tampere, Finland. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics and Research Committee of the participating university and hospital. The study was conducted according to the guidelines in the Declaration of Helsinki. All families provided written informed consent for participation in the study.\n</p>\nIn this study, 5 longitudinal samples per child were collected between 1998 and 2012. For each child, longitudinal samples were obtained corresponding to either of the ages of 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months. This cohort comprises the samples from 120 children: 40 progressors to T1D (PT1D), 40 who tested positive for at least one Ab in a minimum of 2 consecutive samples but did not progress to clinical T1D during the follow-up (P1Ab), and 40 controls (CTRL) subjects who remained islet autoantibody negative during the follow-up until the age of 15. The 3 study groups were matched by HLA-associated diabetes risk, gender and period of birth. In total 428 non-fasting blood samples were collected for this study. Plasma was separated within 30 minutes after the blood collection by centrifugation at 1600 x g for 20 min at room temperature. The plasma samples were stored at -80 \u00b0C until analyzed.",

Briefly, the UHPLC system used in this work was a 1290 Infinity system from Agilent Technologies (Santa Clara, CA, USA). The system was equipped with a multi-sampler (maintained at 10 \u00b0C) using 10% DCM in MeOH and ACN:MeOH:IPA:H2O (1:1:1:1, v/v/v/v) + 0.1% HCOOH as needle wash solutions after each injection for 7.5 s each, a quaternary solvent manager and a column thermostat (maintained at 50 \u00b0C). Separations were performed on an ACQUITY UPLC\u00ae BEH C18 column (2.1 mm x 100 mm, particle size 1.7 \u00b5m) by Waters (Milford, USA).  The flow rate was 0.4 ml/min and the injection volume was 1 \u00b5l. H2O + 1% NH4Ac (1M) + 0.1% HCOOH (A) and ACN:IPA (1:1, v/v) + 1% NH4Ac + 0.1% HCOOH (B) were used as the mobile phases for the gradient elution. The gradient was as follows: from 0 to 2 min 35-80% B, from 2 to 7 min 80-100% B and from 7 to 14 min 100% B. Each run was followed by a 7 min re-equilibration period under initial conditions (35% B).\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] O'Gorman A, Suvitaival T, Ahonen L, Cannon M1, Zammit, Lewis G, Roche HM, Mattila I, Hyotylainen T, Oresic M, Brennan L, Cotter DR.

Nitrogen generated by a nitrogen generator (PEAK Scientific, Scotland, UK) was used as the nebulizing gas at a pressure of 21 psi, as the drying gas at a flow rate of 14 l/min (at 193 \u00b0C) and as the sheath gas at a flow rate of 11 l/min (at 379 \u00b0C). Pure nitrogen (6.0) from Praxair (Fredericia, Denmark) was used as the collision gas. The capillary voltage and the nozzle voltage were kept at 3643 V and 1500 V, respectively. The reference mass solution including ions at m/z 121.0509 and 922.0098 was prepared according to instructions by Agilent and was introduced to the mass spectrometer through the other nebulizer in the dual ESI ion source using a separate Agilent series 1290 isocratic pump at a constant flow rate of 4 ml/min (split to 1:100 before the nebulizer). The acquisition mass range was m/z 100-1700 and the instrument was run in extended dynamic range mode with an approximate resolution of 30,000 FWHM measured at m/z 1521.9715 (which is an ion included in the tune mixture) during calibration of the instrument. MassHunters B.06.01 (Agilent) was used for all data acquisition. Quality control was performed throughout the dataset by including blanks, pure standard samples, extracted standard samples and control plasma samples.",
