                "description": "<p>A more complete and holistic view on host\u2013microbe interactions is needed to understand the physiological and cellular barriers that affect the efficacy of drug treatments and allow the discovery and development of new therapeutics. Here, we developed a multimodal imaging approach combining histopathology with mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) and same section imaging mass cytometry (IMC) to study the effects of <em>Salmonella Typhimurium</em> infection in the liver of a mouse model using the <em>S. Typhimurium</em> strains SL3261 and SL1344. This approach enables correlation of tissue morphology and specific cell phenotypes with molecular images of tissue metabolism. IMC revealed a marked increase in immune cell markers and localization in immune aggregates in infected tissues. A correlative computational method (network analysis) was deployed to find metabolic features associated with infection and revealed metabolic clusters of acetyl carnitines, as well as phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine plasmalogen species, which could be associated with pro-inflammatory immune cell types. By developing an IMC marker for the detection of <em>Salmonella</em> LPS, we were further able to identify and characterize those cell types which contained <em>S. Typhimurium</em>.</p>",

                        "description": "<p>Prior to performing network analysis, the raw DESI-MSI data were analysed for peak identification and background signal filtering. An initial segmentation was performed to partition the raw data in tissue/background. A linear <strong>Support Vector Machine (SVM</strong>) classifier was trained on a set of manually labelled pixels using the raw MS data binned with a uniform resolution of 1 m/z. The intensities were log-transformed with an offset equal to 1. No normalisation was applied. The binned raw data contained enough information to discriminate tissue and background pixels (10-fold cross-validation accuracy = 100 %). The SVM model fitted on the entire set of labelled pixels was used to predict the labels of the out-of-sample pixels, generating the tissue-related ROI.</p><p><br></p><p>MS peaks were detected in correspondence of a change of sign of signal first derivative. The corresponding m/z values were re-calibrated using a penalized cubic spline regression fitted on the difference between the observed and theoretical m/z value of the reference ion (309.2036 m/z \u00b1 10 ppm). If more than 1 peak was detected in the search window, only the peak with the highest intensity was considered. The choice of the reference ion was based on the fact that it was detected in the entire image (100 % of pixels). The optimal number of spline nodes was selected among the values 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, corresponding to the minimum mean squared error between the true and predicted m/z differences (3-fold cross-validation).</p><p><br></p><p>Peaks associated with background pixels were filtered by <strong>SPUTNIK</strong>. Peaks negatively correlated with the ROI labels (0=background, 1=tissue) were considered tissue-unrelated and therefore removed. Peaks with a non-zero value in less than 10 connected pixels (8-neighbourhood) were considered representative of noise signal (possibly due to low intensity or shot-noise) and removed from the dataset. The remaining re-calibrated peaks from the only ROI pixels were used for the following analysis. Ion co-localisation networks were determined using <strong>weighted co-expression networks analysis (WGCNA)</strong>. Analysis was performed on the MSI dataset as a whole. Data was imported as <strong>.imzML</strong> format. All DESI-MSI spectra were first normalised using quantile normalisation, using the <strong>limma</strong> package for <strong>R</strong>. Quantile normalisation represented a good balance between speed and performance in preserving the real correlation patterns in metabolomics data, given a sufficiently large sample size. Only positive Pearson\u2019s correlations were used as a similarity metric between all pairs of ion images. To reduce the effect of spurious correlations, the similarities were raised to a power of 6. The <strong>topological overlap matrix (TOM)</strong> distance was used as input for the hierarchical clustering (average linkage), to determine the modules of highly correlated ion images. To extract the modules, the <strong>dynamicTreeCut</strong> algorithm was applied to the clustering tree, setting the smallest size of modules equal to 5. <strong>Module eigenvectors (ME)</strong>, defined as the first principal component scores of the MSI data, calculated using the only module ions, were extracted from all modules. Modules with ME that correlated higher than 0.8 were considered identical and merged into a single module.</p>",
