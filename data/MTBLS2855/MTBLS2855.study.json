                "description": "<p>Benthic organisms sustain coral reefs through their growth and metabolism, but less is known about how their released metabolites influence reef seawater microorganisms. To investigate metabolite composition of benthic exudates and their ecological significance for reef microbial communities, we harvested exudates from six species of Caribbean benthic organisms including stony corals, octocorals, and an invasive encrusting algae, and subjected these exudates to untargeted and targeted metabolomics approaches using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Incubations with reef seawater microorganisms were conducted to monitor changes in microbial community composition using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and abundance in relation to exudate source and three specific metabolites. Exudates tended to be enriched in amino acids, nucleosides, and vitamins, indicating that benthic organisms contribute labile organic matter to reefs. The phytohormone indole-3-acetic acid was detected in octocoral exudates, suggesting that this metabolite facilitates microbial interactions within and outside of benthic organisms. Exudate compositions were species-specific and significantly enriched in the indole class of metabolites. Microbial abundances and specific microbial taxa responded differently in relation to exudates from stony corals and octocorals, demonstrating the link between benthic organismal composition, metabolite exudates, and microbial growth. Conversely, microbial communities did not respond to additions of the individual metabolites, suggesting that reef microorganisms likely provide diverse metabolite pools that support microbial growth. This work provides novel information about the metabolites released from common Caribbean benthic organisms and indicates that the recent shifts in benthic composition from stony to octocorals alter exudate composition and likely impact microbial community composition and function on coral reefs.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>UPLC-MS Metabolite collection incubation assays</strong> are reported in the current study <strong>MTBLS2855</strong></p><p><strong>UPLC-MS Metabolite uptake incubation assay</strong> is reported in <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/editor/study/MTBLS3286' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS3286</strong></a></p>",

Each of the 6 experiments was carried out for 1 species at a time. A brief description of the experimental design is included below with additional details in the Supplementary Methods in the paper associated with this study.</p><p><br></p><p>Before each organism experiment, 58 L of surface (non-reef) seawater was collected ~1 mile offshore (18 17.127\u00b0 N, 064 44.312\u00b0 W, 31.6 m depth). Cells and particles were removed using peristaltic pressure through a 0.2 \u03bcm filter (47 mm, Omnipore, EMD Millipore Corporation, Billerica, MA, USA) using metabolomics-grade tubing and the filtrate was collected for the incubations. Additionally, 2-3, 2 L filtrate subsets per experiment were acidified with concentrated hydrochloric acid (final concentration 1% volume/volume) and subjected to solid-phase-extraction (SPE) using a negative vacuum pressure of -3.7 to -5 100xkPA in Hg, to serve as controls. Before SPE, 6 ml, 1 gm Bond Elut PPL cartridges (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) were pre-conditioned with 6 ml of 100% methanol.</p><p><br></p><p>For the experiments, 6 species of benthic organisms were collected from reefs around Lameshur Bay. Experiments were completed on 3 stony corals (<em>Porites astreoides</em>, <em>Siderastrea siderea</em>, and <em>Psuedodiploria strigosa</em>), 2 octocorals (<em>Plexaura homomalla</em> and <em>Gorgonia ventalina</em>), and 1 encrusting alga (<em>Ramicrusta textilis</em>) (see <strong>Table S1</strong> in the paper associated with this study). <em>P. astreoides</em>, <em>S. siderea</em>, and <em>R. textilis</em> were held in a seawater table for 24 hr before the incubations and colonies from the other 3 species were held for 2-3 hr. Coral and algal fragments were generally small (2.5-5.0 cm in length).</p><p><br></p><p>For each incubation, 9, acid-washed, 10 L polycarbonate bins containing FSW (4 L) with lids were secured into an illuminated aquarium table (Prime HD, Aqua illumination, Bethlehem, PA, USA) (Photosynthetically Active Radiation = ~350-600 \u03bcmol quanta/m^2/s). Air bubblers with sterilized Fluorinated Ethylene Propylene (FEP) tubing (890 Tubing, Nalgene, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) were used to inject air into each bin. Surface seawater was circulated through the aquarium table to maintain reef seawater temperature (29.5 \u00b0C). 6 colonies/fragments of 1 species were randomly placed into 6 bins. The other 3 bins were reserved for control incubations containing filtered seawater (FSW) only. A sensor (8K HOBO/PAR loggers; Onset, Wareham, MA) monitored temperature and light conditions. At the end of each 8 hr experiment, colonies/fragments were wrapped in combusted aluminum foil and flash frozen in a charged dry shipper. The water in all the incubations was re-filtered (as outlined above) and 2 L of each filtrate was acidified and subjected to SPE as described above. SPE cartridges were wrapped in combusted aluminum foil, placed in WhirlPak bags, and frozen at -20 \u00b0C.</p>",

Ion modes were analyzed separately. Before processing with XCMS, the R package <strong>Autotuner[2]</strong> was used to find XCMS processing parameters appropriate for the data. In XCMS, the <strong>CentWave</strong> algorithm picked peaks using a gaussian fit. The specific parameters for peak picking for both ion modes were: noise = 10000, peak-width = 3-15, ppm = 15, prefilter = c(2,168.600), integrate = 2, mzdiff = -0.005, snthresh = 10. <strong>Obiwarp</strong> was used to adjust retention times and this step was followed by correspondence analysis. For statistical analyses, MS1 features (defined as unique pairings of mass-to-charge (m/z) values with retention times) in both ion modes were culled following XCMS if they: <strong>1)</strong> had &gt;1 average fold change in the MQ blanks compared to the other samples, <strong>2)</strong> occurred in less than 20% of samples (excluding pooled controls), and/or <strong>3)</strong> were invariant (relative standard deviation of &lt;15%) across the samples (adapted from<strong>[3]</strong>). This feature-removal strategy retained 27% (2317) of MS1 features ionized in positive mode and 84% (4725) of features ionized in negative mode.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Targeted metabolomics:</strong></p><p>For targeted metabolomics analysis, tandem MS/MS data files were converted into <strong>mzML</strong> files using <strong>msconvert</strong> and processed with El-MAVEN<strong>[4]</strong>. Calibration curves for each compound (8 points each) were constructed based on the integrated peak areas using El-MAVEN. The concentrations of metabolites in the original samples were determined by dividing each concentration by the volume of the filtrate that passed through each PPL column. Finally, metabolite concentrations above the limits of detection and quantification were corrected for extraction efficiency using in-house values determined using standard protocols<strong>[5]</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Smith CA, Want EJ, O'Maille G, Abagyan R, Siuzdak G.

The <strong>MetaboAnalyst 5.0</strong> web browser<strong>[5]</strong> was used to putatively identify enriched metabolic pathways in the untargeted data using the mummichog algorithm<strong>[6]</strong>. Lastly, mass of each colony was determined and Pearson correlations were conducted to investigate whether colony size significantly correlated with targeted metabolite concentrations, but we found no correlations between colony size and metabolite concentrations across all species.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Wang M, Carver JJ, Phelan VV, Sanchez LM, Garg N, Peng Y et al.
