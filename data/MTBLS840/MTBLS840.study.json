                "description": "Acting as chemical defense or signaling compounds, secondary metabolites (SMs) play an essential role in the evolutionary success of many angiosperm plant families. However, the adaptive advantages that SMs confer, and the influence of environmental and developmental factors on SMs expression, remains poorly understood. A study of taxa endemic to the variable Andean climate, using a metabolomics approach, may provide further insight. By analyzing gene expression patterns and metabolic fingerprints, we report herein the developmental and environmental regulation of the secondary metabolism of Smallanthus sonchifolius (yac\u00f3n), a medicinal Andean plant. Our results demonstrate a clear developmental stage dependent regulation of the secondary metabolism of yac\u00f3n leaves wherein the metabolic diversity increases with plant age. However, environmental factors seem to regulate biosynthetic pathways, creating differences in the expression of chemical classes, pointing to an association between transcription levels of relevant genes and the relative amounts of more than 40 different metabolites. This study suggests that the secondary metabolism of yac\u00f3n is regulated by a complex interplay between environmental factors and developmental stage and provides insight into the regulatory factors and adaptive roles of SMs in Andean taxa.",

Considering that the investigated clone did not naturally flower in the field, the maturity of the plant was determined in accordance with hallmarks found within the literature: when plants reached more than 1.5 m height, stems began to wither away and bend and when tuberous roots were completely developed<strong>[1]</strong>. In the conditions of central Europe, the length of the vegetation period of yac\u00f3n ranges from 149 to 170 days<strong>[1]</strong>. In this study, all plants came from the same clone held at the Botanic Garden of the University of Hohenheim, and they were propagated by rhizome cuttings in the form of germinated rhizomes to ensure genetic homogeneity in the studied samples.</p><p><br></p><p>Collection of yac\u00f3n leaves started 15 days after sprouting and continued every 15 days for a period of 6 months. In each collection, the third pair of leaves (from top to bottom), corresponding to the first well-expanded leaf, was sampled and stored at \u221270\u2009\u00b0C until further use. Collections were always performed at the same hour of the day (between 17:00 and 18:00 h). The development of yac\u00f3n can be divided into 5 main growth phases after sprouting (see Fig. 2a in the paper associated with this study): leaf development (I), stem ramification (II), crop cover (III), formation of tuberous roots (IV) and flowewing (V)<strong>[1]</strong>. In each collection, the developmental stage of the plant was recorded. 3 biological replicates were collected for each time point.</p><p><br></p><p>For each collection date, climate data from the closest climatological station (Wetterstation Hohenheim) to the cultivation field were obtained. Climate data included temperature (\u00b0C), air humidity (%), solar radiation (Wh/m^2) and rainfall (mm). For data analysis, average (temperature, humidity and rainfall) values for the 15 days prior to each collection were considered. In the case of solar radiation, the accumulated value for the day of collection was considered as previous studies demonstrate that UV-light induces a rapid response in gene expression<strong>[2]</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Fernandez CE et al.

After 2 min in liquid nitrogen, samples were ground on a MM300 mixer mill (Retsch GmbH) for 30 s at a frequency of 30 Hz. Homogenized samples were extracted with 70% aqueous ethanol (1 ml) by vortexing for a few seconds followed by ultrasonication at room temperature for 10 min at 40 kHz.

The following MZmine parameters were used for data preprocessing: noise level at 1.0E^5; Lorentzian function as peak shape algorithm (resolution of 70,000); minimum peak height at 5.0E^5; m/z tolerance at 0.002 m/z or 5.0 ppm and retention time tolerance of 0.7 min. After MZmine preprocessing, data for each ionization mode were exported as.csv tables with rows representing plant extracts and columns representing ion peak areas associated with a given mass and retention time value.

Initially, raw data from each ionization mode (positive and negative) was transformed to nonproprietary.mzXML format using the MSConvert package from the ProteoWizard 3.0.9798 software (Proteowizard Software Foundation, USA) to subsequently upload it to the GNPS platform. Consensus spectra of nearly identical MS/MS spectra were created via MS-Cluster, considering a parent and a fragment ion mass tolerance of 0.02 Da and a minimum of 2 MS/MS spectra in a consensus to be considered for molecular networking. Networks were created with edges having a cosine score above 0.65 and a minimum of 4 common fragment ions shared by 2 separate consensus MS/MS spectra in order to be connected by an edge. Edges between 2 nodes were kept in the network only if both nodes were within the top 10 most similar nodes to each other. Spectral library annotation was performed considering a minimum of 4 common fragment ions, and Cytoscape 3.6.1 was used to display and edit the final structure of the network.</p><p><br></p><p>To confirm the compound annotation made by molecular networking, we performed a systematic comparison of retention time, UV, HRMS and MS/MS spectra of experimental data with authentic standards and data from the literature. Accurate mass comparisons were performed relative to the theoretical monoisotopic masses (&lt;3 ppm accuracy) of the secondary metabolites previously reported in the genus Smallanthus and in several members of the Asteraceae family (AsterDB), which are freely available at <a href='www.asterbiochem.org/asterdb' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>www.asterbiochem.org/asterdb</a>. To identify compounds previously unreported in the genus Smallanthus, accurate mass values were used to perform online database searches in the Dictionary of Natural Products (DNP, <a href='http://dnp.chemnetbase.com' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>http://dnp.chemnetbase.com</a>) and in SciFinder Scholar. To confirm peak assignments, the fragmentation patterns of the identified metabolites were proposed based on MS2 spectra and the following reference substances: quinic acid, enhydrin, uvedalin and longipilin acetate were used to compare accurate mass measurements and MS2 spectra to those of the detected metabolites. Based on the Metabolomics Standard Initiative<strong>[2]</strong>, 3 levels of confidence were adopted to report the accuracy of the identifications: level 1 (identified compounds), based upon co-characterization with authentic samples; level 2 (putatively annotated compounds), 'based upon physicochemical properties and/or spectral similarity with public/commercial spectral libraries' and level 3 (putatively characterized compound classes), 'based upon characteristic physicochemical properties or spectral similarity to known compounds of a chemical class'. In all cases, a minimum of 2 independent and orthogonal data (e.g., accurate mass and MS2 fragmentation patterns or retention time and accurate mass, etc.) were considered. Detailed information regarding all of the identified metabolites is reported in Table S1 of the paper associated with this study.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Wang M, Carver JJ, Phelan VV, Sanchez LM, Garg N, Peng Y, Nguyen DD, Watrous J et al.
