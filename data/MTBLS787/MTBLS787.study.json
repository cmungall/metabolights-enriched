                "description": "<p>Data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry (DIA-MS) is essential for information-rich spectral annotations in untargeted metabolomics. However, the acquired MS2 spectra are highly complex, posing significant annotation challenges. We have developed a correlation-based deconvolution (CorrDec) method that uses ion abundance correlations in multi-sample studies using DIA-MS as an update of our MS-DIAL software. CorrDec is based on the assumption that peak intensities of precursor and fragment ions correlate across samples, and exploits this quantitative information to deconvolute complex DIA spectra. CorrDec clearly improved deconvolution of the original MS-DIAL deconvolution method (MS2Dec) in a dilution series of chemical standards and a 224-sample urinary metabolomics study. The primary advantage of CorrDec over MS2Dec is the ability to discriminate co-eluting low-abundance compounds. CorrDec requires the measurement of multiple samples to successfully deconvolute DIA spectra, and our randomized assessment demonstrated that CorrDec can contribute to studies with as few as 10 unique samples. The presented methodology improves compound annotation and identification in multi-sample studies and will be useful for applications in large cohort studies.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Chemical standards assay</strong> is reported in the current study <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS787' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS787</strong></a>.</p><p><strong>Urine assay</strong> is reported in <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS816' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS816</strong></a>.</p>",

The first dilution was prepared for each of the compounds at a starting concentration of 400 \u03bcM. Then, as shown in <strong>Figure S6</strong> in the paper associated with this study, 2 x 10-fold serial dilutions and 10 x 1.5-fold serial dilutions were performed in a 96-well 0.2 ml PCR plate PCR-96-MJ (BMBio, Tokyo, Japan) using 8-channel pipette to obtain end concentrations ranging from 69 to 4000 nM. A pierceable seal 4Ti-0531 (4titude, UK) was used to seal the plate for 4 s at 185 \u00b0C using PX1 heat sealer (Biorad, USA). The plate was stored at 4 \u00b0C until LC-MS measurement. 2 \u03bcl of each dilution were injected with a water blank between each compound dilution series (see <strong>Table S7</strong> in the paper associated with this study).</p>",

LC-MS measurements in AIF mode were performed as described previously<strong>[1][2]</strong>. Briefly, metabolite separation was performed on a HILIC SeQuant ZIC-HILIC (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) column 100 A\u030a (100 x 2.1 mm, 3.5 \u03bcm particle size) coupled to a guard column (2.1 x 20 mm, 3.5 \u03bcm particle size). Sample analysis was performed using water with 0.1% formic acid (pH 2.63; solvent A) and acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid (solvent B). The elution gradient used was as follows: isocratic step at 95% B for 1.5 min, 95 to 40% B in 12 min, maintained at 40% B for 2 min, then decreasing to 25% B at 14.2 min, maintained for 2.8 min, then returned to initial conditions over 1 min, and a column re-equilibration phase of 7 min. The flow rate was 0.3 ml/min, injection volume 2 \u03bcl, and the column oven was maintained at 25 \u00b0C.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Naz S, Gallart-Ayala H, Reinke SN, Mathon C, Blankley R, Chaleckis R, Wheelock CE.
