                "description": "Myelin is a natural and dynamic multilamellar membrane structure that continues to be of significant biological and neurological interest, especially with respect to its biosynthesis and assembly during its normal formation and maintenance, and pathological breakdown. To explore the usefulness of neutron diffraction in the structural analysis of myelin, we investigated the use of in vivo labeling by metabolically incorporating non-toxic levels of deuterium (2H; D) via drinking water into a pregnant dam (D-dam) and her developing embryos. All of the mice were sacrificed when the pups (D-pups) were 55 days old. Myelinated sciatic nerves were dissected, fixed in glutaraldehyde and examined by neutron diffraction. Parallel samples that were unfixed (trigeminal nerves) were frozen for mass spectrometry (MS). The diffraction patterns of the nerves from deuterium-fed mice (D-mice) versus the controls (H-mice) had major differences in the intensities of the Bragg peaks but no appreciable differences in myelin periodicity. Neutron scattering density profiles showed an appreciable increase in density at the center of the lipid-rich membrane bilayer  This increase was greater in D-pups than in D-dam, and its localization was consistent with deuteration of lipid hydrocarbon, which predominates over transmembrane protein in myelin. MS analysis of the lipids isolated from the trigeminal nerves demonstrated that in the pups the percentage of lipids that had one or more deuterium atoms was uniformly high across lipid species (97.6% \u00b1 2.0%), whereas in the mother the lipids were substantially less deuterated (60.6% \u00b1 26.4%) with the levels varying among lipid species and subspecies. The mass distribution pattern of deuterium-containing isotopologues indicated the fraction (in %) of each lipid (sub-)species having one or more deuteriums incorporated: in the D-pups, the pattern was always bell-shaped, and the average number of D atoms ranged from a low of ~4 in fatty acid to a high of ~9 in cerebroside. By contrast, in D-dam most lipids had more complex, overlapping distributions that were weighted toward a lower average number of deuteriums, which ranged from a low of ~3\u20134 in fatty acid and in one species of sulfatide to a high of 6\u20137 in cerebroside and sphingomyelin. The consistently high level of deuteration in D-pups can be attributed to their de novo lipogenesis during gestation and rapid, postnatal myelination. The widely varying levels of deuteration in D-dam, by contrast, likely depends on the relative metabolic stability of the particular lipid species during myelin maintenance. Our current findings demonstrate that stably-incorporated D label can be detected and localized using neutron diffraction in a complex tissue such as myelin; and moreover, that MS can be used to screen a broad range of deuterated lipid species to monitor differential rates of lipid turnover. In addition to helping to develop a comprehensive understanding of the de novo synthesis and turnover of specific lipids in normal and abnormal myelin, our results also suggest application to studies on myelin proteins (which constitute only 20\u201330% by dry mass of the myelin, versus 70\u201380% for lipid), as well as more broadly to the molecular constituents of other biological tissues.",

At gestational day 12, when the dams were ~10 wk old, the mice were separated into treatment groups, in which their drinking water was replaced with water containing 15% (<strong>D-mice</strong>) or 0% (<strong>control, H-mice</strong>) D2O. Mice were maintained as such through birth and until postnatal day 7, at which point the volume fraction of D2O in their drinking water was increased to 20% (<strong>D-mice</strong>). At postnatal day 13, their drinking water was again increased to 30% volume fraction of D2O. Pups were weaned at postnatal day 28, and all mice were maintained on 30% D2O (<strong>D-mice</strong>) or 0% D2O (<strong>control, H-mice</strong>) until the pups reached postnatal day 55, at which point all mice (including the dams at 131 do) were sacrificed and tissues were harvested as described in the following. The chosen level of D2O in drinking water was below the threshold for toxicity for mice.&nbsp;</p><p>Mice were sacrificed by CO2 asphyxiation, followed by decapitation.

We further vetted the matching of our experimental m/z values to those of lipid species reported specifically for mouse neural tissues (sciatic nerve, cervical dorsal root ganglia, CNS myelin, optic nerve, brain tissues, cerebellum).&nbsp;We also used the extensive tabulated data for rat (adult, male Wistar) sciatic nerve lipids that were analyzed by imaging MS. In our current study, the conditions we used for analyzing the lipids were not sufficient to detect cholesterol, a major myelin constituent, which is usually cationized via alkaline hydrolysis and detected, for example, as ammoniated, lithiated, or sodiated adducts. Spectral accuracy of our original data was determined using <strong>MassWorks </strong>(<strong>Version 6,0,0,0</strong>) software from <strong>Cerno Bioscience</strong> (LasVegas, NV 89144). (The <strong>MassWorks </strong>software also corrected automatically for the presence in the deuterated lipids of the natural isotope abundance that was detected in the non-deuterated samples (H-dam and H-pup spectra, see below). Subsequently, we used <strong>MassWorks </strong>to identify the corresponding deuterated isotopologues in the isolated lipids from the D-mice based on the vetted undeuterated monoisotopes for the isolated lipids from the H-mice, and to quantitate the relative abundance (%) Ai of each isotopologue. The average level of deuteration was calculated by summing these relative percentages (i.e., %D = \u03a3i&gt;0 Ai). From the isotopologue distribution we also calculated the weighted average number (and standard error) of deuteriums for each molecular species of lipid. The stated uncertainties in the quantitation of the data are standard deviations, unless indicated otherwise.</p>",
