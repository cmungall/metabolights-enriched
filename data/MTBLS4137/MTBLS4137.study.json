                "description": "Male and female Plasmodium falciparum gametocytes are the parasite lifecycle stage responsible for transmission of malaria from the human host to the mosquito vector. Not only are gametocytes able to survive in radically different host environments, but they are also precursors for male and female gametes that reproduce sexually soon after ingestion by the mosquito. Here, we investigate the sex-specific lipid metabolism of gametocytes within their host red blood cell. Comparison of the male and female lipidome identifies cholesteryl esters and dihydrosphingomyelin enrichment in female gametocytes. Chemical inhibition of each of these lipid types in mature gametocytes suggests dihydrosphingomyelin synthesis but not cholesteryl ester synthesis is important for gametocyte viability. Genetic disruption of each of the two sphingomyelin synthase genes points towards sphingomyelin synthesis contributing to gametocytogenesis. This study shows that gametocytes are distinct from asexual stages, and that the lipid composition is also vastly different between male and female gametocytes, reflecting the different cellular roles these stages play. Taken together, our results highlight the sex-specific nature of gametocyte lipid metabolism, which has the potential to be targeted to block malaria transmission. This article has an associated First Person interview with the first author of the paper.",

Phase separation was induced by adding 300 \u03bcL of 150 mM ammonium acetate (liquid chromatography\u2013MS grade, Fluka), vortexing for 5 min and centrifuging at 2,000\u00d7g&nbsp;for 5 min. The upper organic layer (representing around 800 \u03bcL) was transferred to a 2 mL glass vial and stored at \u221220&nbsp;\u00b0C.&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to MS analysis, each sample was diluted into methanol:chloroform (2:1 v/v) with 5 mM ammonium acetate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>An aliquot of each extract was hydrolyzed to remove acyl-linked lipids and re-extracted to improve mass spectrometric analysis of sphingolipids. 200 \u03bcL of extract was added to 60 \u03bcL of methanol containing 0.01 % butylated hydroxytoluene, 22 \u03bcL of 10 M NaOH was added (final concentration 0.7 M), and vortexed at 800 rounds per min on an Eppendorf Mixmate for 2 h at room temperature. 60 \u03bcL of 150 mM aqueous ammonium acetate was added to induce phase separation. Tubes were vortexed and spun at 20,000\u00d7g&nbsp;for 5 min to complete phase separation. The upper organic layer was removed to a new 2 mL glass vial, and diluted into methanol:chloroform (2:1 v/v) containing 5 mM ammonium acetate prior to mass spectrometric analysis.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1] </strong>Matyash V, Liebisch G, Kurzchalia TV, Shevchenko A, Schwudke D.

A signal to noise ratio threshold of 20 was applied for inclusion of ionized lipids. Extraction and solvent blanks were analyzed in each data acquisition batch to exclude chemical or solvent impurities. Lipids were quantified in <strong>LipidView </strong>by comparing peak area of each lipid to its class-specific internal standard after isotope correction. Where odd-chain fatty acid phospholipids or ether-linked phospholipids could not be distinguished, phospholipids were assumed to be ether linked. A correction factor of 3.45 was applied to all ether-PE species to account for the ~29 % difference in efficiency in the neutral loss of the 141 Da fragment from plamenyl and diacyl PE respectively<strong>[1],[2]</strong>. Lipid species are annotated<strong>[3]</strong>, except for DAG and TAG.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>LipidView </strong>data was exported to <strong>Excel </strong>then imported to <strong>Markerview v1.2.1.1</strong> (Applied Biosystems, MDS Sciex) with lipid annotation and quantification for statistical analysis of all individual lipid species. Pareto scaling without weighting was applied for unsupervised mode principal component analysis. Multiple t-tests for volcano plots were also performed in <strong>MarkerView </strong>(MDS Sciex). Grouping into lipid classes, calculation of lipid proportions and subtraction of the host cell lipid profile was performed in <strong>Microsoft Excel</strong>. <strong>GraphPad Prism 7 </strong>was used to prepare graphs and perform&nbsp;ANOVA with multiple comparisons on lipid class abundance.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Mitchell TW, Buffenstein R, Hulbert AJ.
