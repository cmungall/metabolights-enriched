                "description": "The bloom-forming diatoms Coscinodiscus granii were cultivated in a non-contact dual cultivation apparatus. This device allows the exchange of exudates, without transfer of any microorganisms, allowing the investigation of both endo- and exo-metabolome. The treatment consisted in infecting diatom cells with parasitic oomycete Lagenisma coscinodiscii. At late infection stage (5 days of incubation), all cultures were recovered and filtrated and the endometabolome was investigated. The healthy cells which were exposed to the exudates of the infected cells were assigned as exposed cells. Healthy cell populations were taken as the controls. The experiment contained 6 replicates per conditions (control vs control, control/exposed vs treatment). Methanolic extractions of all cells were performed and metabolic profiles of the different conditions was conducted with UPLC-MS orbitrap.",

Mass tolerance for fragment identification was 5 ppm; the signal-to-noise ratio threshold was 3.
