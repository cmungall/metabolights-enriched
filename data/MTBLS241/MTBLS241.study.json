                "description": "MS and NMR are two of the most powerful spectroscopic techniques used in the field of fluxomics, to analyze the flux distributions in cellular metabolomic pathways. Both of them possess pros and cons, such as, MS being the most sensitive and low-cost technique, while needs extensive sample processing and providing incomplete labeling data, whereas NMR needs lesser sample preparation and provides more detailed labeling data, while being less sensitive and expensive. Since both techniques could be viewed as complementary to each other, combining their data could yield a detailed and complete information about a system under study. In this case, samples were generated from a single experiment and the same set of samples was used both in MS and 1D NMR to analyze the 13C label distributions in TCA cycle intermediates. The data generated from both methods were used with a simulation script that was developed to integrate the MS and NMR data. MCF-7 breast cancer cell line was used as an experimental model and it was incubated with 100% [1,2-13C]-glucose and 100% [U-13C]-glucose for 8 hours. The cells, before and after incubation with tracers, were frozen in liquid nitrogen and then later processed for extracting the TCA cycle intermediates. Same set of samples were separated for GC-MS and NMR based analysis and processed for the respective techniques. The isotopologue analysis was performed by GC-MS and the isotopomer analysis was performed by NMR and both sets of data were integrated with the simulation software. In this study there is the data for NMR analysis. This study contains the data for NMR analysis. </br></br> The GC-MS assay for this study can be found in the MetaboLights study MTBLS182.</br> <br/>Linked Studies: <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS182' target='_blank'><span class='label label-success'>MTBLS182</span></a>",

The medium used was basal medium DMEM (A14430, Invitrogen) with 10% dialyzed FBS (F0392, Sigma), 0.01 mg/ml Insulin (19278, Sigma), 1% Non-Essential Amino acids (01-340-1B, Biological Industries), 10 mM glucose (G8769, Sigma) and 4 mM Glutamine (25030-81, Life Technologies).\n</p>\nAfter 48 h of cell seeding, media was removed and plates were washed twice with PBS. 6 ml of fresh media containing tracers were added to each plate. The conditions used in this experiment were cold natural samples with [U-12C]-glucose (unlabeled glucose) (A), samples with tracer [U-13C6]-glucose (B) and samples with tracer [1,2-13C2]-glucose (C), amounting to 10 mM of glucose in each case. Time points of 0 h (before adding tracer) and 8 h (after tracers incubation) were maintained. 3 replicates for each condition at 8 h of tracers incubation (B and C) and 1 replicate for cold natural (A) at 8 h were obtained. In addition 3 plates were used for 0 h cell counting and another 3 for 8 h cell counting.\n</p>\nAfter 8 h incubation, medium was removed and kept for biochemical concentration analysis. Plates were washed twice with cold PBS followed by snap-freezing using liquid nitrogen. Plates were kept under -80 \u00baC until their analysis.\n</p>\nThe commercial glucose standard mixture used for validation consisted of 10 mM with the composition of [U-12C]-D-glucose (82%) + [1,2-13C]-D-glucose (10%) + [1-13C]-D-glucose (3%) + [1,6-13C]-D-glucose (5%).",

Tubes were vigorously agitated for 30 min at 4 \u00baC. After agitation, 1/6 part of the content of the tube was transferred to a separate tube. The tube containing the 1/6 part was used for GC/MS analysis and the tube containing the 5/6 part was used for NMR analysis.\n</p>\nNext, tubes were centrifuged and the upper phase containing the polar metabolites was transferred to a separate glass tube.

NOESY pre-saturation was used for water suppression with a 10ms NOESY mixing time. Key parameters were as follows: spectral width 12.15ppm/7288.6Hz; complex points, TD 4096; interscan delay, d1 4s; acquisition time, aq 0.320s; number of scans, ns=128; dummy scans, ds=16. 2D-HSQC: For the 13C-1H HSQCs, the pulse sequence used was based on the Bruker standard pulse program hsqcetgpsp which uses Echo/Antiecho-TPPI gradient selection, with additional gradient pulses to improve water suppression. Key parameters for the 1H observe dimension were: spectral width, 7812.5Hz/13.01ppm; complex points, TD 1024. </p><p>For the 13C indirect dimension, the key parameters were as follows: the 13C carrier was set to 80ppm; complex points, 30% out of 16384 complex points (TD 4096) were sampled using exponentially weighted non-uniform sampling; spectral width 24 kHz/160.0ppm.
