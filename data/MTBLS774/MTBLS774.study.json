                "description": "Ferroptosis is a form of regulated cell death that can be induced by inhibition of the cystine-glutamate antiporter, system xc-. Among the existing system xc- inhibitors, imidazole ketone erastin (IKE) is a potent, metabolically stable inhibitor of system xc- and inducer of ferroptosis potentially suitable for in\u00a0vivo applications. We investigated the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic features of IKE in a diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) xenograft model and demonstrated that IKE exerted an antitumor effect by inhibiting system xc-, leading to glutathione depletion, lipid peroxidation, and the induction of ferroptosis biomarkers both in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo. Using\u00a0untargeted lipidomics and qPCR, we identified distinct features of lipid metabolism in IKE-induced ferroptosis. In addition, biodegradable\u00a0polyethylene glycol-poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles were employed to aid in IKE delivery and exhibited reduced toxicity compared with free IKE in a DLBCL xenograft model.",

Mobile phase A consisted of ACN/water (60:40, v/v) and mobile phase B was IPA/ACN/water (85:10:5, v/v/v) both containing 10 mM ammonium acetate and 0.1% acetic acid. After injection, the gradient was held at 60% mobile phase A for 1.5 min. For the next 12 min, the gradient was ramped in a linear fashion to 100% B and held at this composition for 3 min. The eluent composition returned to the initial condition in 1 min, and the column was re-equilibrated for an additional 1 min before the next injection was conducted. The flow rate was set to 400 \u00b5l/min and injection volumes were 5 \u00b5l using the flow-through needle mode in both positive and negative ionization modes. The QC sample was injected between the samples and at the end of the run to monitor the performance and the stability of the MS platform. This QC sample was also injected at least 5 times at the beginning of the UPLC/MS run, in order to condition the column. ",

                        "description": "The Synapt G2 mass spectrometer (Waters, Manchester, U.K.) was operated in both positive and negative electrospray ionization (ESI) modes. For positive mode, a capillary voltage and sampling cone voltage of 3 kV and 32 V were used. The source and desolvation temperature were kept at 120 \u00b0C and 500 \u00b0C, respectively. Nitrogen was used as desolvation gas with a flow rate of 900 L/hr. For negative mode, a capillary voltage of -2 kV and a cone voltage of 30 V were used. The source temperature was 120 \u00b0C, and desolvation gas flow was set to 900 L/hr. Dependent on the ionization mode the protonated molecular ion of leucine encephalin ([M+H]+, m/z 556.2771) or the deprotonated molecular ion ( [M-H]-, m/z 554.2615) was used as a lock mass for mass accuracy and reproducibility. Leucine enkephalin was introduced to the lock mass at a concentration of 2 ng/\u00b5l (50% ACN containing 0.1% formic acid), and a flow rate of 10 \u00b5l/min. The data was collected in duplicates in the centroid data independent (MSE) mode over the mass range m/z 50 to 1600 Da with an acquisition time of 0.1 secs per scan. The QC samples were also acquired in enhanced data independent ion mobility (IMS-MSE) in both positive and negative modes for enhancing the structural assignment of lipid species. The ESI source settings were the same as described above. The traveling wave velocity was set to 650 m/s and wave height was 40 V. The helium gas flow in the helium cell region of the ion-mobility spectrometry (IMS) cell was set to 180 ml/min to reduce the internal energy of the ions and minimize fragmentation. Nitrogen as the drift gas was held at a flow rate of 90 ml/min in the IMS cell. The low collision energy was set to 4 eV, and high collision energy was ramping from 25 to 65 eV in the transfer region of the T-Wave device to induce fragmentation of mobility-separated precursor ions.

Then, they were subjected to peak-picking, retention time alignment, and grouping using XCMS package6 (version 3.2.0) in R (version 3.5.1) environment.  For the peak picking, the CentWave algorithm7 was used with the peak width window of 2-25 s. For peak grouping, bandwidth and m/z-width of 2 s and 0.01 Da were used, respectively. After retention time alignment and filling missing peaks, an output data frame was generated containing the list of time-aligned detected features (m/z and retention time) and the relative signal intensity (area of the chromatographic peak) in each sample. Technical variations such as noise were assessed and removed from extracted features' list based on the ratios of average relative signal intensities of the blanks to QC samples (blank/QC &gt;1.5). Also, peaks with variations larger than 30% in QCs were eliminated. Multivariate and univariate analyses were performed using MetaboAnalyst 8(version 4.0) and in R (version 3.5.1) environment. Group differences were calculated using VIP scores of PLS-DA model and one-way ANOVA (p &lt; 0.05) and false discovery rate of 5% to control for multiple comparisons. </div>",
