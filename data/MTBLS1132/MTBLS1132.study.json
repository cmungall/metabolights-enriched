                "description": "Solanum dulcamara (Bittersweet nightshade) shows significant intraspecific variation in glycoalkaloid (GA) composition and concentration. We previously showed that constitutive differences in overall GA levels are correlated with feeding preference of the grey field slug (GFS; Deroceras reticulatum). One particularly preferred accession, ZD11, contained low GA levels, but high levels of previously unknown structurally related uronic acid conjugated compounds (UACs). Here we test whether different slug species as well as insect herbivores show similar feeding preferences among six S. dulcamara accessions with different GA chemotypes. In addition, we investigate whether slug feeding can lead to induced changes in the chemical composition and affect later arriving herbivores. A leaf disc assay using greenhouse-grown plants showed that three slug species similarly preferred accessions with low GA levels. Untargeted metabolomic analyses showed that previous slug feeding consistently increased the levels of N-caffeoyl-putrescine and a structurally related metabolite, but not the levels of GAs and UACs. Slug-induced responses only affected slug preference in one accession. A common garden experiment using the same six accessions revealed that ZD11 received the highest natural gastropod feeding damage, but suffered the lowest damage by specialist flea beetles. The latter preferred to feed on accessions with high GA levels. Our study indicates that different selection pressures imposed by generalist gastropods and specialist insects may explain part of the observed chemical diversity in S. dulcamara.",

Plants were grown in a greenhouse in net cages to prevent insect infection (Rovero 0.3 mm gauze, 7.50 x 3 x 2.75 m, L x W x H) at a 16 h photoperiod and minimum temperatures set to 20 \u00b0C / 17 \u00b0C (day/night). Light levels were supplemented with 1000 W Sodium lamps (Philips GreenPower, Amsterdam, the Netherlands) fixed above the cages providing ~280 \u00b5mol m/s light intensity at the plant level. All plants were 38 days old and at least 60 cm tall when used for experiments. Plants were fitted with clip cages, either containing one adult grey field slug (feeding-induction treatment, 4 clones/accession) or empty clip cages (control treatment, 4 clones/accession), on the tip of two leaves (number 10 and 11 from the apex) to prevent total leaf consumption. The cages and slugs were removed after 72 h and left for an additional 24 h before sampling. Leaf tissue that was outside of the clip cage was sampled in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 \u00b0C until further processing for chemical analyses.</p>",

Mass spectra of the dataset obtained from analysing the 1:5 diluted samples were processed using XCMS and CAMERA packages in R [1][2]. Peak picking and alignment was done within a retention time between 45\u2013700 sec, signal:noise ratio \u2265 50, maximum deviation of 5 ppm, 3 sec retention time window, mass/charge window of 0.005 and minimum occurrence in three out of four samples in at least one treatment group. Resulting features were grouped to belong to the same compound after symmetric retention time correction, within a retention time window of maximum 5 sec and minimum mutual correlation of 0.8. Feature intensities were multiplied by their dilution factor (5) and samples normalised by the fresh weight of the leaf material used for extraction. Missing values were replaced by the treatment group mean value only when one of four replicates was missing or else by a random value between 1 and 7722 (half of the minimum value in the complete dataset). Feature groups, potentially representing single compounds, were reduced to one feature to represent the respective compound in later analysis. This was done by applying the inhouse maximum heuristic approach, which selects the feature with the highest intensity in the majority of the samples. Intensities of the 50 most prominent peaks (signal:noise &gt; 10) were manually identified from the datasets obtained from the 1:5 and 1:50 diluted samples, following the same procedure as described in Calf et al. [3]. Feature intensity values were multiplied by their dilution factor (5 or 50) and values in the 1:5 dilution dataset exceeding the saturation intensity threshold value of 6 \u00d7 10^6 g\u22121 FW were replaced with the corresponding value from the 1:50 dilution dataset. The dataset of abundant features and that processed by XCMS and CAMERA were then merged to a single dataset. Features which were quantified by both procedures, were replaced by the manually retrieved feature intensities. This approach resulted in a dataset with 286 features, hereafter referred to as compounds. Log10-transformed peak intensities were used for analyses.</p><p><br></p><p>References:</p><p>[1] Kuhl C, Tautenhahn R, B\u00f6ttcher C, Larson TR, and Neumann S.
