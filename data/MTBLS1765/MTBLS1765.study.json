                "description": "<p><strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong> Because of its ease of collection, urine is one of the most commonly used matrices for metabolomics studies. However, unlike other biofluids, urine exhibits tremendous variability that can introduce confounding inconsistency during result interpretation. Despite many existing techniques to normalize urine samples, there is still no consensus on either which method is most appropriate or how to evaluate these methods. </p><p><strong>OBJECTIVES:</strong> To investigate the impact of several methods and combinations of methods conventionally used in urine metabolomics on the statistical discrimination of two groups in a simple metabolomics study. </p><p><strong>METHODS:</strong> We applied 14 different strategies of normalization to 40 urine samples analysed by liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS). To evaluate the impact of these different strategies, we relied on the ability of each method to reduce confounding variability while retaining variability of interest, as well as the predictability of statistical models. </p><p><strong>RESULTS:</strong> Among all tested normalization methods, osmolality-based normalization gave the best results. Moreover, we demonstrated that normalization using a specific dilution prior to the analysis outperformed post-acquisition normalization. We also demonstrated that the combination of various normalization methods does not necessarily improve statistical discrimination.</p><p><strong>CONCLUSIONS:</strong> This study re-emphasized the importance of normalizing urine samples for metabolomics studies. In addition, it appeared that the choice of method had a significant impact on result quality. Consequently, we suggest osmolality-based normalization as the best method for normalizing urine samples.</p>",

The NutriNet-Sant\u00e9 study was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki guidelines and was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the French Institute for Health and Medical Research (IRB Inserm no 0000388FWA00005831) and the 'Commission Nationale de l\u2019Informatique et des Libert\u00e9s' (CNILno 908450/no 909216). Clinicaltrials.govnumber: NCT03335644. At the clinical visit, urine sample collection was performed using vessels allowing for closed-circuit urine transfer from the vessel to a Vacutainer tube. Urine samples were collected either in autumn/winter (n\u2009=\u200923) or spring/summer (n\u2009=\u200917) from 2011 to 2014. The Vacutainer tubes containing the spot urine samples were kept at 4 \u00b0C before and during transportation to the central laboratory. After splitting into aliquots, urine samples were stored at -80 \u00b0C for further analyses.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Hercberg S, Castetbon K, Czernichow S, Malon A, Mejean C, Kesse E, Touvier M, Galan P.

The third part was specifically diluted to standardize osmolality levels based on the smallest value, determined using a freezing point osmometer (Loeser Messtechnik, Berlin, Germany) and then diluted 1:3 (v/v) in mobile phase A. After dilution, all samples were vortexed and centrifuged at 9500 x g for 5 min. The supernatant was collected and transferred into vials to be directly analysed by UHPLC-MS. QC samples were prepared by pooling equivalent volumes of all samples.

A volume of 10 \u00b5L was injected into a Hypersil Gold C18 (1.9&nbsp;\u03bcm, 100&nbsp;mm x 2.1&nbsp;mm) analytical column (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Illkirch, France) at a flow rate of 0.3&nbsp;mL/min and maintained at 40&nbsp;\u00b0C. A linear gradient programme was set up with mobile phase A: 95% H2O/5% methanol/0.1% acetic acid, and mobile phase B: 100% methanol/0.1% acetic acid. The initial conditions were 100% A, followed by a linear gradient from 0 to 100% B in 30&nbsp;min. These conditions were held for 4&nbsp;min prior to switching in 1&nbsp;min to the starting conditions that were held for 5&nbsp;min to equilibrate the column. Samples were analysed in 3 analytical batches, and QC samples were injected at the beginning of each batch and then every 6 samples to evaluate analytical drift.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Jamin EL, Costantino R, Mervant L, Martin JF, Jouanin I, Blas-Y-Estrada F, Gu\u00e9raud F, Debrauwer L.

                        "description": "<p>Metabolomics data are complex, and there are multiple sources of variability, so it is sometimes difficult to isolate variability due to biological factors of interest. For this reason, it is necessary to define and identify the different sources of variability to apply appropriate filters and decrease some unwanted variabilities. It is therefore mandatory to distinguish between variability linked to the biological factor studied, which is called biological variability of interest, and variability not linked to the biological factor. The latter can be divided into several factors, such as technical variability, confounding biological variability and residual variability. Technical variability can, for instance, originate from sample preparation or analytical drift. Confounding biological variability is related to a known biological factor other than the factor of interest (e.g., biofluid concentration, BMI, etc.). Finally, residual variability corresponds to the remaining variability not explained by these previous factors. Full-HRMS data were processed using XCMS 3.0 with the collaborative environment Workflow4Metabolomics (W4M) dedicated to the processing of metabolomics data<strong>[1]</strong>. Extraction of data from full scan spectra was carried out using the centwave algorithm (ppm\u2009=\u200910, peak width\u2009=\u2009c(5,40), sntresh\u2009=\u200910, noise\u2009=\u200910000, bw\u2009=\u200910, mzwid\u2009=\u20090.01). Data were then filtered using a ratio of the average signal in QCs over the average signal in blanks with a threshold of 3. We also eliminated all features displaying a correlation coefficient with dQC samples lower than 0.6. LOESS regression was applied based on QC samples to correct intra- and inter-batch drift. At the end, only common features displaying an RSD lower than 30% in QC samples were retained. PQN and MSTUS normalization were performed using the W4M environment. For PQN normalization, the median of the QCs was chosen as a reference.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Giacomoni F, Le Corguill\u00e9 G, Monsoor M, Landi M, Pericard P, P\u00e9t\u00e9ra M, Duperier C, Tremblay-Franco M, Martin JF, Jacob D, Goulitquer S, Th\u00e9venot EA, Caron C.
