                "description": "<p>Nucleic acid and histone modifications critically depend on tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle for substrates and co-factors. Although a few TCA cycle enzymes have been reported in the nucleus, the corresponding pathways are considered to operate in mitochondria. Here, we show that&nbsp;a part of the TCA cycle is operational also in the nucleus. Using&nbsp;13C-tracer analysis, we identified activity of glutamine-to-fumarate, citrate-to-succinate, and glutamine-to-aspartate routes in the nuclei of&nbsp;HeLa cells. Proximity labeling mass-spectrometry revealed a spatial vicinity of the involved enzymes with core nuclear proteins. We further show nuclear localization of aconitase 2 and 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase in mouse embryonic stem cells. Nuclear localization of the latter enzyme, which produces succinyl-CoA, changed from pluripotency to differentiated state with accompanying changes in the nuclear protein succinylation. Together, our results demonstrate operation of an extended metabolic pathway in the nucleus warranting a revision of the canonical view on&nbsp;metabolic compartmentalization.</p>",

For nuclei experiments, the cells were seeded in 245x245 mm plates (2.0 x 106&nbsp;cells/plate) and cultivated for 3 days. The nuclei isolation method was adapted from Ori and colleagues<strong>[1]</strong>.&nbsp;The below described quantities refer to the collection of one 245 mm plate. Briefly, cells were washed three times with 10 mL PBS followed by addition of Trypsin-EDTA (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 25300096). Once cells were detached from the plate, 20 mL of cultivation medium was added, and the cells were collected. From here onwards, all steps were performed in ice-cold conditions. Following centrifugation at 500g for 5 min, the cell pellet was washed with 10 mL PBS and centrifuged under the same conditions. Subsequently, the cell pellet was resuspended in 7.5 mL hypotonic buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1 \u00b5g/ mL aprotinin (Carl-Roth, A162.1) and 0.5 \u00b5g/ mL leupeptin (Carl-Roth, CN33.3)) and incubated on ice for 30 min. Once the cells were swollen, rapture was achieved utilizing a Dounce homogenizer with pestle B. Cell lysis efficiency was monitored through light microscopy. Once cells were sufficiently lysed, the hypotonic buffer A was adjusted to buffer B (0.25 M sucrose, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 25 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM DTT, 1 \u00b5g/mL aprotinin and 0.5 \u00b5g/mL leupeptin). A fraction of whole cell lysates was immediately used for the 13C-labeling experiments. The rest of the lysates were centrifuged at 1,000xg for 8 min and the pelleted nuclei were resuspended in 10 mL buffer B. Following centrifugation, the nuclei pellet was resuspended in 3 mL buffer consisted of one part buffer B and 2 parts buffer C (2.3M sucrose, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH7.5, 25 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM DTT, 1 \u00b5g/mL aprotinin, 0.5 \u00b5g/mL leupeptin). The resuspended nuclei were transferred to ultracentrifuge tubes (Beckman, 3440057) and 1.5 mL of buffer C was slowly placed at the bottom of the tubes with a needle of at least 18G. The nuclei were centrifuged at 21,000xg for 30 min in a Beckman ultracentrifuge equipped with a SW55Ti rotor. Subsequently, the interphase and the supernatant were carefully aspirated via vacuum, and the nuclei pellet was resuspended in 1 mL buffer B and centrifuged at 1,000xg for 8 min. This step was repeated 2 more times. The nuclei were immediately utilized for the 13C-labeling experiments.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>13C-labeling experiments</strong></p><p><strong><span class='ql-cursor'>\ufeff</span></strong>Freshly isolated nuclei were resuspended in 500 \u03bcL incubation buffer containing 0.25 M sucrose, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 25 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM DTT, 1 \u00b5g/mL aprotinin, 0.5 \u00b5g/mL leupeptin, 1 mM ATP, 1 mM ADP, 1 mM FAD, 1 mM NAD+&nbsp;and either one of the following substrates at a final concentration of 10 mM: <strong>[U-13C]pyruvate, [U-13C]citrate, [U-13C]glutamine, [U-13C]succinate </strong>or <strong>[1,2-13C2]acetyl-CoA </strong>(Cambridge Isotopes, Inc). For the experiments analyzed by LC-MS, the incubation buffer additionally contained 0.1 mM thiamine pyrophosphate and 0.1 mM CoA. For the indicated experiments, the following inhibitors with the respective final concentrations were used: 0.5 \u03bcM fluorocitrate (Merck, F9634), 20 \u03bcM fluoroacetate (Merck, 341460), 1 mM aminooxyacetate (Merck, C13408) and 20 \u03bcM GSK864 (Merck, SML1757). The nuclei were incubated for<strong> 1 or 5 hours </strong>in the dark at 37 \u00b0C. Following incubation, the nuclei were centrifuged at 1,000xg for 8 min at 4 \u00b0C, washed with 1 mL ice-cold PBS and centrifuged again. This step was repeated 2 times. The nuclei pellets were saved at -80 \u00b0C until metabolite extraction for metabolomics analysis.</p><p>For whole cell lysates, the same procedure described for the isolated nuclei with slight modifications was followed. In brief, fresh whole cell lysates resuspended in buffer B were adjusted to the incubation buffer by adding the missing compounds and were incubated as above. At the end of the incubation period, the samples were saved at -80 \u00b0C until metabolite extraction for metabolomics analysis.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1] </strong>Ori A, Andr\u00e9s-Pons A, Beck M.
