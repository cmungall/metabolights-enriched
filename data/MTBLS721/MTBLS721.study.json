                "description": "Increasing concerns over\u00a0the possible risks of\u00a0nanotechnology necessitates breakthroughs in structure-activity relationship (SAR) analyses of engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) at nano-bio interfaces. However, current nano-SARs are often based on univariate assessments and fail to provide tiered views on ENM-induced bio-effects. Here we report a multi-hierarchical nano-SAR assessment for a representative ENM, Fe2O3, by metabolomics and proteomics analyses. The established nano-SAR profile allows the\u00a0visualizing\u00a0of the contributions of seven basic properties of Fe2O3 to its diverse bio-effects. For instance, although surface reactivity is responsible for Fe2O3-induced cell migration, the inflammatory effects of Fe2O3 are determined by aspect ratio (nanorods) or surface reactivity (nanoplates). These nano-SARs are examined in THP-1 cells and animal lungs, which allow us to decipher the detailed mechanisms including NLRP3 inflammasome pathway and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1-dependent signaling. This study provides more insights for nano-SARs, and may facilitate the tailored design of ENMs to render them desired bio-effects.",

The metabolite extracts were stored at -80 \u00b0C after lyophilization. The other portion is lysed in 1 ml cold lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, 0.1% v/v Triton-100, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% dithiothreitol, 8 M urea, 1 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM NaF, 10% protease inhibitor cocktail)[2] and probe sonicated on ice with 6 cycles of 10 s ON/OFF at a frequency of 20 kHz. After centrifugation at 20,000 x g for 10 min, each lysis supernatant was collected and added to 8 ml extraction solute (acetone/ethanol/acetic acid 50:50:0.1) pre-cooled at -20 \u00b0C. Protein extracts were collected by centrifugation at 20,000 x g for 30 min after 24 h precipitation at -20 \u00b0C. After lyophilization and re-dissolution in 8 M urea, the protein concentrations in each sample were determined by a Bradford method. The proteins were denaturalized, digested and desalted according to a reported method[2][3], to prepare peptide samples and stored at \u221280\u2009\u00b0C after lyophilization.</p><p><br></p><p>Ref:</p><p>[1] Myers JN, Rekhadevi PV, Ramesh A.

The parameters were set as follows: centWave settings for feature detection (maximal tolerated m/z deviation = 15 ppm, minimum peak width = 10 s, and maximum peak width = 80 s), obiwarp setting for RT correction (profStep = 1) and mzwid = 0.015, minfrac = 0.5, and bw = 5 for chromatogram alignment. The RTs, m/z values, and peak intensities of metabolites were exported to an Excel spreadsheet for processing. Relative quantification of metabolite features were performed as following processes: (1) peak intensities were normalized to the internal standards: l-Methionine-(methyl-13C, d3) (m/z, 154.077) for positive mode, and d-Glucose-1,2,3,4,5,6,6-d7 (m/z, 186.099) for negative mode; (2) we compared the normalized peak intensities between control and particle-treated samples in Metaboanalyst (www.metaboanalyst.ca) to perform scatter plot, heat map, cluster, and ANOVA analysis. The parameters for data pro-processing in MetaboAnalyst were set as follows: removing features with &gt; 90% missing values and estimating missing values using k-nearest neighbor method; using interquantile range method for data filtering to remove features from baseline noises; normalization by reference feature (154.077 for ESI+\u2009data and 186.099 for ESI\u2212 data), no data transformation, and pareto scaling were chosen for normalization procedure. For statistics, non-parametric ANOVA (Kruskal\u2013Wallis Test) was performed and the adjusted p-value (FDR) cutoff is 0.05. A list of features with their p-values and FDR values was downloaded from the software. ED is used to measure the dissimilarity of samples with multivariate variables.</p>",
