                "description": "The ectopic deposition of fat is thought to lead to lipotoxicity and has been associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and diabetic cardiomyopathy. We have measured mitochondrial respiratory capacities in the hearts of ob/ob and wild-type mice on either a regular chow (RCD) or high-fat (HFD) diet across four age groups to investigate the impact of diet and age on mitochondrial function alongside a comprehensive strategy for metabolic profiling of the tissue. Myocardial mitochondrial dysfunction was only evident in ob/ob mice on RCD at 14 months, but it was detectable at 3 months on the HFD. Liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (LC\u2013MS) was used to study the profiles of acylcarnitines and the accumulation of triglycerides, but neither class of lipid was associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. However, a targeted LC\u2013MS/MS analysis of markers of oxidative stress demonstrated increases in GSSG/GSH and 8-oxoguanine, in addition to the accumulation of diacylglycerols, which are lipid species linked to lipotoxicity. Our results demonstrate that myocardial mitochondria in ob/ob mice on RCD maintained a similar respiratory capacity to that of wild type until a late stage in aging. However, on a HFD, unlike wild-type mice, ob/ob mice failed to increase mitochondrial respiration, which may be associated with a complex I defect following increased oxidative damage.",

Briefly, frozen tissues were added to 600 \u00b5l methanol-chloroform (2:1;v/v), the samples were homogenized with a Tissuelyser (Qiagen, UK) for 5 min at a frequency of 20/s and sonicated for 15 min. Water and chloroform (each of 200 \u00b5l) were added to the samples before being centrifuged at 13,300 rpm for 7 min. The resulting aqueous and organic phases were separated from the protein pellets. The extraction procedure was repeated on the remaining protein pellets. Both organic and aqueous phases were collected and evaporated to dryness. The dried samples were stored at -20 \u00b0C until further analysis.\n</p>\nAcylcarnitines:</br>\nFrozen tissues were added to 200 \u00b5l of acetonitrile containing a mixture of isotopically labeled carnitines: l-carnitine (N-trimethyl-d9), l-acetylcarnitine (N-methyl-d3), l-propionylcarnitine (N-methyl-d3), l-butyrylcarnitine (N-methyl-d9), l-isovalerylcarnitine (N-trimethyl-d9), l-octanoylcarnitine (N-methyl-d3), l-myristoylcarnitine (N-trimethyl-d9), and l-palmitoylcarnitine (N-methyl-d3) (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc., MA, USA).
