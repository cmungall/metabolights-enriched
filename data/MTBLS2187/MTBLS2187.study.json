                "description": "<p>In order to explore opportunities for personalized and predictive health care, we collected serial clinical measurements, health surveys and multiomics profiles (genomics, proteomics, autoantibodies, metabolomics and gut microbiome) from 96 individuals. The participants underwent data-driven health coaching over a 16-month period with continuous digital monitoring of activity and sleep. Multiomics factor analysis resulted in an unsupervised, data-driven and integrated view of human health, revealing distinct and independent molecular factors linked to obesity, diabetes, liver function, cardiovascular disease, inflammation, immunity, exercise, diet and hormonal effects. The data revealed novel and previously uncovered associations between risk factors, molecular pathways, and quantitative lifestyle parameters. For example, ethinyl estradiol use had a distinct impact on metabolites, proteins and physiology. Multidimensional molecular and digital health signatures uncovered biological variability between people and quantitative effects of lifestyle changes, hence illustrating the value of the combined use of molecular and digital monitoring of human health.</p>",

Ions were generated by a 70 eV electron beam at an ionization current of 2.0 mA, and 30 spectra/s were recorded in the mass range m/z 50-800. The acceleration voltage was turned on after a solvent delay of 150 s.

The gas temperature was set to 150 \u00b0C, the drying gas flow to 16 l/min and the nebulizer pressure 35 psig. The sheath gas temp was set to 350 \u00b0C and the sheath gas flow 11 l/min. The capillary voltage was set to 4000 V in positive ion mode, and to 4000 V in negative ion mode. The nozzle voltage was 300 V. The fragmentor voltage was 380 V, the skimmer 45 V and the OCT 1 RF Vpp 750 V. The collision energy was set to 0 V.
