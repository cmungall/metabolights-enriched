                "description": "<p>Most of pre-diabetes were eventually progress to diabetes, thereby profiling of prediabetic metabolic disorders may be an effective targeted preventive measure. We aimed to elucidate internal motivation of the progression of pre-diabetes to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) from a metabolic perspective. Four sets of serum samples (20 subjects per group) according to fasting blood glucose (FBG) concentration were collected for metabolomic analysis. An integrative approach of metabolome and WGCNA was employed to explore candidate metabolites. Compared with healthy group (FBG &lt; 5.6 mmol/L), 113 metabolites were differentially expressed in the early stage of pre-diabetes (5.6 mmol/L \u2264 FBG &lt; 6.1 mmol/L), 237 in the late stage of pre-diabetes (6.1 mmol/L \u2264 FBG &lt; 7.0 mmol/L) and 245 in T2DM group (FBG \u2265 7.0 mmol/L). A total of 27 DEMs were identified shared in all comparisons. Among them, L-norleucine was down-regulated whereas ethionamide, glutathione oxidized, 5-Methylcytosine and alpha-D-Glucopyranoside beta-D-fructofuranosyl were increased with the rising of FBG. Surprisingly, 15 (11 LPCs, L-norleucine, glutathione oxidized, arachidonic acid and 5-Oxoproline) of the 27 DEMs were ferroptosis-associated metabolites. WGCNA clustered all metabolites into 8 modules and pathway enrichment analysis of DEMs showed a significant annotation to insulin resistance-related pathway. Integrated analysis of DEMs, ROC and WGCNA modules determined 12 potential biomarkers for pre-diabetes and T2DM, including L-norleucine, 8 of which were L-arginine or its metabolites. L-norleucine and L-arginine could be served as biomarkers for pre-diabetes. The inventory of metabolites provides by our serum metabolome offer insights into T2DM physiology metabolism.</p>",

Enrolled subjects met the 2019 US American Diabetes Association (ADA) diagnostic criteria for pre-diabetes and diabetes. According to the criteria of the Chinese Diabetes Society (CDS) about FBG, pre-diabetes was defined as 6.1 mmol/L \u2264 FBG &lt; 7.0 mmol/L, whereas according to the criteria of the ADA about FBG, pre-diabetes was defined as 5.6 mmol/L \u2264 FBG &lt; 6.9 mmol/L. Due to the difference in the diagnostic criteria between China and American, we want to explore the abnormal metabolic changes that occur in Chinese T2DM patients when their FBG \u2265 5.6 mmol/L, to provide a theoretical basis for the early prevention and control of diabetes in China, thereby subjects were divided into four groups according to FBG values. As following: group A (n = 20), FBG &lt; 5.6 mmol/L, healthy people with normal glucose tolerance; group B (n = 20), 5.6 mmol/L \u2264 FBG &lt; 6.1 mmol/L, the early stage of pre-diabetes patients; group C (n = 20), 6.1 mmol/L \u2264 FBG &lt; 7.0 mmol/L, the late stage of pre-diabetes patients; group D (n = 20), FBG \u2265 7.0 mmol/L, T2DM patient. Details of each subject were shown in Table S1 in the paper associated with this study.</p><p><br></p><p>Type 1 diabetes and other special types of diabetes; individuals with diabetes-related acute or chronic complications; various secondary hypertensive conditions; those with chronic kidney or liver diseases or cancer; absence of anemia and a history of severe cardiovascular, cerebrovascular diseases or tumors; recent lack of subjective meal management in daily life; no recent blood donation or blood product transfusion events; no history of drug abuse or other psychotropic medications; females who are not pregnant or in the lactation period, and so forth.</p><p><br></p><p>All subjects provided signed informed consent. The study was approved by the The First People\u2019s Hospital of Yinchuan Ethics Committee. All experiments were conducted in strict accordance with the relevant laws in China and followed the institutional guidelines of The First People\u2019s Hospital of Yinchuan.</p><p><br></p><p>All subjects fasted overnight for at least 12 h before blood collection. The collected venous blood samples were allowed to stand at room temperature for 1 h for coagulation and stratification and then centrifuged at 2500 x g for 4 min. Retained the supernatant and centrifuged again for 10 min, and finally supernatant was collected and stored at -80 \u00b0C for subsequent extraction study. UPLC-MS/MS and bioinformatics analysis were performed by Beijing Biomarker Technology (Beijing, China).</p>",

Each molecule was quantified using a targeted multiple reaction monitoring approach based on the peak area of the chromatographic peak on the MultiQuant software. Based on the metabolite abundance obtained above, PCA and OPLS-DA were performed for each sample using the R (v 3.3.2) package. Fold changes of molecular were determined between the different groups using the t test to assess whether differences between the groups were statistically significant. The screening criterion for differentially expressed metabolites (DEMs) was fold change &gt; 1, P &lt; 0.05 and variable importance in the projection (VIP) &gt; 1.
