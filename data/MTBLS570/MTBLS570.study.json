                "description": "Priming and activating immune stimuli have profound effects on macrophages, however, studies generally evaluate stimuli in isolation rather than in combination. In this study we have investigated the effects of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory stimuli either alone or in combination on macrophage metabolism. These stimuli include host factors such as IFN\u03b3 and ovalbumin-immunoglobulin immune complexes, or pathogen factors such as LPS. Untargeted LC-MS based metabolomics provided an in-depth profile of the macrophage metabolome, and revealed specific changes in metabolite abundance upon either individual stimuli or combined stimuli. Here, by factoring in an interaction term in the linear model, we define the metabolome interactome. This approach allowed us to determine whether stimuli interact in a synergistic or antagonistic manner. In conclusion this study demonstrates a robust approach to interrogate immune-metabolism, especially systems that model host-pathogen interactions.",

                        "description": "Male C57 BL/6 mice, aged 8-12 weeks were used to generate bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDM). Approval for these procedures was given prior to their initiation by the University of Glasgow ethics committee and by the U.K. Home Office under License No. 60/4314.\n</p>\nOn day 0, bones were cut at each end and a 23-gauge needle (Kenke Sass Wolf Fine-Ject\u00ae) was used to flush out bone marrow from leg bone with complete RPMI (RPMI (Thermo Fisher) supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, 1% (v/v) penicillin streptomycin solution (Sigma), 10% FBS (Thermo Fisher) :cRPMI) into a 9 cm Petri dish (Thermo Fisher). To obtain a single cell suspension, cells were passed through a 70 \u00b5M cell strainer (Easy strainer\u2122 Greiner bio-one), pelleted by centrifugation (300 RCF, 5 min) and resuspended in cRMPI to obtain a density of 6-7 x 10^6 cells/ml. Cell number was calculated using Trypan blue exclusion (1:1 cells: Trypan blue (Sigma)) to ensure that >95% were viable. The BMDM were matured using 20% L929 supernatant over 7 days (5% CO2, 37 \u00baC). On day three, 5 ml cRMPI and 2 ml L929 supernatant were added. On day 6 BMDM were harvested. Medium was removed by aspiration and plates were washed once with warm dPBS to remove remaining non-adherent cells. Note that this wash was only done for experiments involving overnight IFNgamma treatments. To each plate 6 ml of ice-cold dPBS was added for 1-2 min. Cells were detached by gentle scraping, transferred to a 50 ml falcon tube. Plates rinsed once more with 6 ml of ice-cold dPBS, transferring the same 6 ml between plates to collect remaining cells. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation (300 RCF, 5 min), resuspended in cRMPI and viable cell number was calculated using Trypan blue exclusion. Cell density was then adjusted by dilution to desired density (10^6 cells/ml in this study). Next, cells were left to re-adhere overnight in tissue culture plates. Typically 6, and 98 flat well plates were used (Costar). Fore LCMS experiments 3 x 10^6 macrophages/well/replicate were seeded in a 6 well plate at a density of 10^6 cells/ml. The stimuli used were murine IFNgamma (Peprotech, 315-05), LPS (Sigma: E. coli 0111:B4, Ref L2630) and OIC. IFNgamma (100 U/ml: 0.02 \u00b5G/ml) was added for overnight stimulation, after which either LPS (100 nG/ml) or ova immune complexes (OIC) were added for 6 hr. To make ova immune complexes, 136.4 \u00b5g anti ova (Creative diagnostics: DPAB26522 polyclonal rabbit serpinb14)) and 13.63 \u00b5g albumin (Sigma: A3912) were dissolved in dPBS (Gibco, Magnesium and Calcium free), mixed and incubated at 37 \u00baC for 30 min prior to use. Note that LPS and OIC were added to wells without replacing medium (i.e. IFNgamma was not removed).",

Medium was aspirated and cells were washed once with dPBS (Magnesium and Calcium free, no EDTA), aspirating immediately. Ice-cold extraction solvent (chloroform/methanol/water, 1:3:1) was added to each well, including an empty well (for solvent blank), and cells were left shaking (1 hr, 4 \u00baC). Solvent was then transferred to 1.5 ml micro-tubes, and centrifuged (18,000 RCF, 15 min, 4 \u00baC). Supernatant was immediately transferred to 2 ml screw-cap tubes. Sample from each tube was transferred to a new screw-cap tube for pooled sample. At this point, samples were capped with Argon, and then stored at -80 \u00baC until LC-MS analysis. To calculate protein levels post extraction, NaOH (0.1 M, 400 \u00b5l/10^6 cells) was added to each well. The plates were left shaking (15 min 4 \u00baC). Plates were next centrifuged (300 RCF, 5 min) and 10 \u00b5l of supernatant transferred to a 96 well plate. To the same plate, a 10 \u00b5l of a BSA (Sigma) dilution series (2 fold: 0.5-0 mg/ml in 0.1 M NaOH) was added. Finally, 190 \u00b5l of Bradford reagent (BioRad) was added to each plate on top of samples and standards. Absorbance was measured at 595 nm using a FLUOstar OPTIMA micro-plate reader.",
