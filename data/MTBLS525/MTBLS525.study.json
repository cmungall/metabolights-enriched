                "description": "Despite that most microorganisms live as part of community, we have modest knowledge about the interactions among microbial community members in nature, and the implications of those interactions for emergent community properties or ecosystem-relevant functions. To facilitate advances in understanding microbial interactions, we describe a straightforward synthetic community system for interrogating the extracellular interactions among microbial community members. The laboratory-scale system physically separates microbial populations within the community, but allows for chemical interactions via a shared media reservoir. Community goods, including small molecules, extracellular enzymes, and antibiotics, can be assayed using sensitive mass spectrometry, and community member outcomes can be assayed, for example, using flow cytometry, biomass measurements, and transcript analyses. The synthetic community design allows for determining the causes and consequences of community diversity and functional outcomes given manipulation of community membership or structure, abiotic stressors, or temporal dynamics. Because it is versatile to accommodate any artificial or environmental microbiome members, scalable to high-throughput capacity, flexible to an array of experimental designs, and accessible to a variety of laboratories because no specialized or costly components are required, this synthetic community system has the potential to practically advance knowledge of microbial interactions within both natural and artificial communities.",

Isolated colonies were inoculated in 5 ml of M9-0.2% glucose media and grown overnight at 28 \u00b0C with gentle shaking. Overnight cultures of each strain were diluted 1:20 in fresh M9-glucose media prior to inoculation in the transwell plates (130 \u00b5l/well) and the media reservoir was filled with 31 ml M9-glucose. Transwell plates were prepared as described above. For each transwell experiment, a custom R script (\u201cRandomArray\u201d) was used to randomize community member placement in the wells so that each member occupied a total of approximately 31 wells per plate. For each of 4 replicate time courses (where each time course included 5 points assessed every 5 hr over stationary phase), 5 replicate transwell plates were prepared for destructive sampling. Transwell plates were incubated at 28 \u00b0C with gentle shaking (~0.32 rcf). The first plate was destructively sampled at 15 h and each subsequent plate was destructively sampled every 5 h thereafter until 35 h. Spent media (~ 31 ml) from the shared reservoir was flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 \u00b0C prior to metabolite extraction.",
