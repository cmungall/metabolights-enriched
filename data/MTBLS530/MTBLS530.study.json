Metabolites were run on a TOF Mass Spectrometer using an ANP column. Initial analysis was done in an untargeted manner, and processing was done to determine the differentially expressed metabolites based on their mass and retention times. Further analysis was then performed to assign identities to the differentially expressed metabolites using a database of biologically-relevant metabolites whose standards had been run under identical conditions as the samples in the study.",

Briefly, individual EC or PVC tissues were homogenized in 400 \u00b5l of ice-cold methanol using a bead mill homogenizer (TissueLyser II, Qiagen) at 25 beats/s, 2x for 45 s each. Following homogenization, samples were incubated in 1200 \u00b5l of MTBE for 1 hr at room temperature to separate organic-soluble lipids from aqueous-soluble lipids and other small-molecules. Finally, 360 \u00b5l of ultrapure water was added (for a final ratio of 3:1:0.9 MTBE:methanol:water) to resolve the 2 liquid phases, and each samples were centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 10 min. The lower aqueous phase and the upper organic phase was collected from each sample and stored in separate tubes, and the remaining protein pellets were resuspended in 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8, with 2.5% SDS. A BCA protein assay was performed on each protein fraction, and both the aqueous phase and organic phase were normalized to their protein concentration equivalent with 50% and 100% methanol respectively. All samples were then stored at -80 \u00b0C prior to analysis.",

Briefly, Profinder performs batch recursive feature extraction, which consists of a first-pass identification of features (ions) that possess a common elution profile (e.g. identical mass-to-charge [m/z] ratios and retention times), followed by a recursive analysis to re-mine each sample for the presence of features that were identified in at least one sample. Feature extraction was limited to the top 2000 metabolites per ion detection mode, with each metabolite possessing a minimum abundance of 600 ion counts. Each feature was also manually validated following extraction (with investigators blinded to genotype assignments during validation), and re-integration was performed when necessary. Differential expression analysis was performed using Mann-Whitney tests, with a Benjamini Hochberg correction applied to adjust for false-positive discovery rates (FDR) considering multiple group comparisons.",
