                "description": "The improvement of breeding efficiencies for heterotic and climate-resilient crops can mitigate the food shortage crisis from overpopulation and climate change. Thus far, diverse molecular markers have been utilized for guiding field phenotypic selections, while the accurate predictions of complex heterotic traits are rarely reported. Here we present a practical metabolome-based prediction strategy for yield heterosis in rice. The dissection of population structures based on untargeted metabolite profiles, rather than the screening of predictive variables, was proved to be the initial critical step in multivariate modeling. Then the assessment of each predictive variable's contribution to predictive models was more precise according to all latent factors compared to the conventional first one. Metabolites belonging to specific pathways were tightly connected to yield heterosis, and the up-regulation of galactose metabolism represent robust yield heterosis for hybrids across different growth conditions. Our study demonstrates that metabolome-based predictive models with correctly dissected population structures and screened predictive variables can realize accurate prediction of yield heterosis and manifest great potential for establishing molecular marker-based precision breeding programs.",

Ten seedlings at the same developmental stage were transplanted in plastic pots with a spacing of 2 x 2 cm. Two biological replicates were set for each genotype. Seedlings were grown at 30 \u00b0C in a light incubator set to 70% humidity with a 16 h light/8 h dark photoperiod. On the 15th day, approximately ten seedlings without parts close to soil (approximately 0.5 cm) and roots were harvested in liquid nitrogen after being washed with ddH2O three times. Two biological replicates of the three pairs of reciprocal hybrids and 18 parents were treated as two independent experimental samples, and two repeats of the 107 recombinant inbred lines and Yuetai A were combined as a single experimental sample for each genotype.",

The temperature and flow rate of the drying gas were 250 \u00b0C and 16 L/min, respectively. The temperature and flow rate of the sheath gas were 400 \u00b0C and 12 L/min, respectively. The pressure of the nebulizer gas was 20 pounds per square inch (psi). The capillary voltage, nozzle voltage, and fragment voltage were 3,000 V, 0 V, and 175 V, respectively. The TOF mass spectra data were collected from 60 to 1,200 Da. The acquisition rate was 4 spectra/s and the cycle time was 250 ms. Subsequently, another quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Triple TOF 6600, AB SCIEX, Foster City, California, USA) was used to acquire tandem mass spectra (MS/MS) data of the quality control sample. The parameters of ion source gas1, ion source gas2, and the curtain gas were 40, 80, and 30 psi, respectively. The source temperature was at 650 \u00b0C, and the ion spray voltage floating was -4,500 V. The mass range for the TOF MS scan was 60-1,200 Da, and the quality control sample was injected twice to increase the data acquisition rate with the mass range divided into four sequential windows: 60-200, 190-400, 390-600, and 590-1,200 Da and 200-600, 590-750, 740-900, and 890-1,200 Da. The MS accumulation time was 200 ms/spectra and the tandem mass spectra were collected in an information-dependent acquisition manner in high-sensitivity mode. The declustering potential was -60 V, and the collision energy was at 35 \u00b1 15 eV. Ten candidate ions were monitored per cycle using an isotope isolation width of 4.0 Da, and the MS/MS accumulation time was 50 ms.",
