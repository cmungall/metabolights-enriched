                "description": "<p>Here we present LipidCreator, a software that fully supports targeted lipidomics assay development. LipidCreator offers a comprehensive framework to compute MS/MS fragment masses for over 60 lipid classes. LipidCreator provides all functionalities needed to define fragments, manage stable isotope labeling, optimize collision energy and generate in silico spectral libraries. We validate LipidCreator assays computationally and analytically and prove that it is capable to generate large targeted experiments to analyze blood and to dissect lipid-signaling pathways such as in human platelets.</p><p><br></p><p>In MTBLS1381, to validate the performance and accuracy of the transition lists provided by LipidCreator and their applicabability on other MS platforms, we used the transition lists for targeted profiling of lipid mediators in human platelet material. Platelets were stimulated with 0.01 U/ml thrombin, 1 U/ml thrombin, 1 \u00b5g/ml CRP or 5 \u00b5g/ml CRP for 5 min. The MS profiling of unstimulated and stimulated platelet material (pellet and supernatant) was performed after HPLC separation on an AB Sciex QTrap 6500 (Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany) in negative mode. Samples were measured in triplicates, interspersed with blank and standard runs.</p><p><br></p><p>Studies linked to this manuscript include;</p><p><a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS1333' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>MTBLS1333; LipidCreator: Collision Energy Optimization and Fragment Intensity Prediction for Lipid Mediators - Thermo QExactive HF</a></p><p><a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS1334' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>MTBLS1334; LipidCreator: Collision Energy Optimization and Fragment Intensity Prediction for Lipid Mediators - Agilent QTof</a></p><p><a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS1369' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>MTBLS1369; LipidCreator: Platelet isolation and stimulation - Targeted Phospho- and Glycerolipid Profiling</a></p><p><a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS1375' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>MTBLS1375; LipidCreator: Targeted lipidomics analysis of Human Plasma samples and comparison with NIST SRM 1950 standard</a></p><p><a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS1376' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>MTBLS1376; LipidCreator: Targeted lipidomics analysis of S. cerevisiae to determine true and false identification</a></p><p><a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS1381' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>MTBLS1381; LipidCreator: Platelet isolation and stimulation - Targeted Lipid Mediator Profiling</a></p><p><a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS1382' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>MTBLS1382; LipidCreator: Platelet isolation and stimulation - DIA Lipid Mediator Validation</a></p>",

In brief, 225&nbsp;\u00b5l of MeOH (4&nbsp;\u00b0C) were added to platelet cell pellet or platelet supernatant in an Eppendorf polypropylene tube that was placed on ice. After a few seconds of treatment with ultrasonication and vortexing, 8&nbsp;\u00b5l of the SPLASH standard and 750&nbsp;\u00b5l MTBE (4 \u00b0C) were added. The mixture was incubated for 1&nbsp;h at 4&nbsp;\u00b0C in a thermomixer at 650&nbsp;rpm. Subsequently 188&nbsp;\u00b5l of ultrapure water was added to induce phase separation. The samples were centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 10&nbsp;mins at 4&nbsp;\u00b0C, afterwards the upper organic layer was transferred to another Eppendorf tube and dried under continuous N2 flow. The dried lipid extract was re-suspended in 100&nbsp;\u00b5l of IPA/MeOH/CHCl3 (4:2:1, v/v/v) for further MS analysis. The lower layer was used to precipitate proteins by adding 903&nbsp;\u00b5l MeOH after removing the interphase and samples were stored at -80&nbsp;\u00b0C for 3&nbsp;hrs in order to perform protein precipitation. Protein pellets were collected after centrifugation at 19,000 x g for 30&nbsp;mins at 4&nbsp;\u00b0C and stored in 1&nbsp;% SDS, 150&nbsp;mM NaCl, 50&nbsp;mM Tris (pH 7.8) solution at -80&nbsp;\u00b0C. Protein amount was quantified by BCA (bicinchoninic acid assay, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, USA).</p><p>To extract lipid mediators, additional 20&nbsp;\u00b5l of acetic acid (99.99%, 17.5M) was added together with mediator internal standard mixture (consisting of 0.5&nbsp;mg/l of TXB2-d4 and PGE2-d4; 5&nbsp;mg/l of PGD2-d4, 12-HETE-d8 and AA-d8; 0.2&nbsp;mg/l of 15-HETE-d8 and 13-HODE-d4; 0.01&nbsp;mg/l of DHA-d5; and 0.02&nbsp;mg/l of EPA-d5) and 750&nbsp;\u00b5l MTBE into the sample. After that, same incubation and centrifugation procedures as described above were applied. The dried lipid extract was re-suspended in 50&nbsp;\u00b5l of MeOH for further MS analysis.

The separation was carried out at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min with the following 20 min long gradient: initial (0 % B), 0.0-1.0 min (hold 0 % B), 1.0-13.0 min (0-100 % B), 13.0-16.0 min (hold 100 % B), 16.0 min (0 % B), 16.0-20.0 min (hold 0 % B).
