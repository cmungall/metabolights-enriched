                "description": "<p><strong>PURPOSE:</strong> Amino acids (AAs) play important physiological roles in living cells. Some amino acid changes in blood are specific for autoimmune disorders, and some are specific for thyroid cancer. The aims of this study were to profile AA metabolites in the serum of patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC0) without Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis (HT) and patients with PTC with HT (PTC1) and predict whether AA metabolites are associated with thyroid disease, thyroid hormone and thyroid autoantibodies. </p><p><strong>METHODS:</strong> A total of 93 serum samples were collected, including 28 healthy controls (HCs), 28 PTC0 patients and 37 PTC1 patients. Serum samples were analysed by high-performance liquid chromatography-triple stage quadrupole-mass spectrometry (HPLC-TSQ-MS), and 21 amino acids (AAs) were detected.</p><p><strong>RESULTS:</strong> The serum concentration of glutamic acid was significantly elevated in PTC1 patients compared with PTC0 patients. Lysine was the second amino acid that differentiated these two groups of PTC patients. In addition, the serum concentrations of glycine, alanine and tyrosine were significantly reduced in both PTC patient groups compared to the HC group. These AAs were also correlated with thyroid hormones and antibodies. Five amino acid markers, namely, glycine, tyrosine, glutamic acid, glutamine and arginine, separated/distinguished PTC0 patients from healthy subjects, and eight AA markers, the same AAs as above without arginine but with alanine, leucine, valine and histidine, separated/distinguished PTC1 patients from healthy subjects based on ROC analysis.</p><p><strong>CONCLUSION:</strong> Compared with the HCs, changes in AAs in PTC0 and PTC1 patients showed similar patterns, suggesting the possibility of a common pathophysiological basis, which confirms preliminary research that PTC is significantly associated with pathologically confirmed HT. We found two AAs, lysine and alanine, that can perform diagnostic functions in distinguishing PTC1 from PTC0.</p>",

Only patients with confirmed PTC by histopathology were included in the study. Coexistent Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis (HT) was determined by elevated anti-thyroglobulin antibodies (TgAbs) and thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb) and postoperative sectioning and examination of paraffin-embedded thyroid tissue specimens; a positive result was defined as the presence of diffuse lymphocytic and plasma cell infiltrate, oxyphilic cells, formation of lymphoid follicles and reactive germinal centers. The controls were healthy participants. The control group consisted of women without hypertension, chronic kidney disease, heart failure, ischemic heart diseases, cerebrovascular, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, type 2 diabetes mellitus and thyroid diseases. Blood samples were collected in the morning from all study subjects, and before thyroidectomy from PTC patients. After the blood was centrifuged, the serum samples obtained were stored in aliquots at -80 \u00b0C until assayed.</p>",
