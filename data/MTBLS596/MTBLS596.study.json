                "description": "<div>BACKGROUND: Epidemiological evidence suggests a link between pesticide exposure and the development of metabolic diseases. However, most experimental studies have evaluated the metabolic effects of pesticides using individual molecules, often at non relevant doses or in combination with other risk factors such as high fat diets.<br></div><div>OBJECTIVES: We aimed to evaluate, in mice, the metabolic consequences of chronic dietary exposure to a pesticide mixture at non-toxic doses, relevant to consumers\u2019 risk assessment.<br></div> METHODS: A mixture of six pesticides commonly used in France i.e. boscalid, captan, chlorpyrifos, thiofanate, thiacloprid, and ziram was incorporated in a standard chow diet, at doses exposing mice to the acceptable daily intake (ADI) of each pesticide. Wild-type (WT) and Constitutive Androstane Receptor knock-out (CAR-/-) C57Bl6/J male and female mice were exposed for 52 weeks. We assessed metabolic parameters (body-weight, food and water consumption, glucose tolerance, urinary metabolome) throughout the experiment. At the end of the experiment, we evaluated liver metabolism (histology, transcriptomics, metabolomics) and pesticide detoxification using LC/MS.<br>RESULTS: In males, pesticide exposure increased body weight and adiposity and induced hepatic steatosis and glucose intolerance. Exposed females exhibited fasted hyperglycaemia, hepatic oxidative stress and perturbations of gut microbiota-related urinary metabolites. The Constitutive Androstane Receptor is involved in the sexually dimorphic response to pesticide exposure.<br><div> CONCLUSIONS: We show for the first time the sexually dimorphic obesogen and diabetogen effects of a chronic dietary exposure to a realistic mixture of pesticides, which are partially mediated through CAR. This raises questions about the relevance of ADI for individual pesticides when present in a mixture.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Untargeted urine UPLC-MS assay</b> protocols and data are reported in the current study <b>MTBLS596</b>.</div><div><br><b>Untargeted urine, plasma and liver NMR assay</b> protocols and data associated to this study are reported in <a href=https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/mtbls602><b>MTBLS602</b></a>.<br></div>",

                        "description": "8 weeks old female and male C57BL/6J mice were purchased from Janvier Laboratories (France) and acclimatized for 4 weeks. CAR knockout mice back-crossed on the C57BL/6J background were previously described[1]. The C57Bl/6J mice served as wild-type (WT) strain for comparison with the CAR-/- mice on the same genetic background (C57Bl/6J). Both strains were treated in the same manner and experiments conducted concurrently to allow direct comparison of results. From 8 to 12 weeks old, the animals were allowed to acclimatize to laboratory conditions. At the beginning of the experiment mice were 12 weeks old and metabolic parameters were followed. At 16 weeks old, diets were switched to either a pesticide-enriched or -free diet and the dietary exposure was continued for 52 weeks. A mixture of 6 pesticides commonly used in France i.e. boscalid, captan, chlorpyrifos, thiofanate, thiacloprid, and ziram was incorporated in a standard chow diet, at doses exposing mice to the tolerable daily intake (TDI) of each pesticide.\n</p>\nThe 72 WT mice and the 72 CAR-/- mice were housed in the laboratory animal room (23 \u00b1 2 \u00b0C). 8 groups of 18 animals each were used in this study: WT males exposed, WT males non-exposed, WT females exposed, WT females non-exposed, CAR-/- males exposed, CAR-/- males non-exposed, CAR-/- females exposed and CAR-/- females non-exposed. Mice were randomly distributed into control and experimental groups. No cage effect was observed. We used a 1 year exposure in 3-month old mice which mimics a 30-year exposure period in human adults.\n</p>\nDuring the 6th, 26th, and 48th week of exposure, the mice were placed in individual metabolic cages (Techniplast France) to obtain 24-h urine samples. The samples were stored at -80 \u00b0C until analysis. Urine from 7 to 8 mice per group was screened for pesticides and their metabolites using liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (HPLC-HRMS).\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Wei P, Zhang J, Egan-Hafley M, Liang S, Moore DD.

High-resolution mass spectra were acquired between m/z 80 and 800 at a resolution of 30,000. The mass spectrometer was calibrated using the Thermo Scientific calibration solution in agreement with their protocol. Tandem mass spectrometry (MS-MS) spectra were obtained using the collision induced dissociation (CID) mode of the ion trap analyser at low resolution and a normalized collision energy of 25%.",

                        "description": "HPLC-HRMS data were analyzed using a methodology previously developed for exposomics studies[1]. From the 6 studied pesticides, a list of suspected metabolites was compiled from previously described metabolites of these pesticides, as well as all other putative phase II metabolites (see Table S2 from the paper associated with this study). Thus, the signals of 16 compounds were monitored for the metabolism of boscalid (15 metabolites + the parent molecule), 13 for thiachlopride (12 metabolites + the parent molecule), 30 for captan (29 metabolites + the parent molecule), 9 for thiophanate (8 metabolites + the parent molecule), 4 for chlorpyrifos (3 metabolites + the parent molecule), and 9 for ziram (9 metabolites). However, standards of these metabolites are not commercially available. In this study, a direct comparison with nonexposed animals was used as a validation strategy. From data extracted with xcms, 16 features matched the theoretical m/z of monitored compounds with a mass precision  < 5 ppm. MS-MS experiments were performed to confirm the identity of suspected compounds. Conjugation to glucuronic acid was confirmed by detection of the characteristic loss of 176 unified atomic mass (u), the conjugation to sulphate confirmed by the loss of 80 u, and the conjugation to mercapturic acid confirmed by the loss of 129 u. Concerning captan metabolites, MS-MS spectra of the ion detected at m/z 150.0564, corresponding to the in-source fragmentation of sulfate and glucuronic conjugates of tetrahydrophtalimide (THPI), showed a loss of 43 u corresponding to neutral isocyanic acid CONH, validating the identification of these metabolites. Finally, 7 features were confirmed by MS-MS experiments, corresponding to 5 metabolites: 2 metabolites of captan {[M-H]- and [(M-SO3)-H]- of THPI conjugated to sulphate and [(M-GlcAc)-H]- of THPI conjugated to glucuronic acid}, 1 metabolite of chlorpyrifos {[M-H]- of 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol}, and 2 metabolites of boscalid {[M-H]- and [(M-GlcAc)-H]- of 2-chloro-N-(4\u2032-chloro-5-hydroxybiphenyl-2-yl) nicotinamide conjugated to glucuronic acid and the [M-H]- of the mercapturic conjugation of boscalid}.
