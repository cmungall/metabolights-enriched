                "description": "<p>Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare endocrine malignancy with a high risk of relapse and metastatisation. The actin-bundling protein fascin (FSCN1) is overexpressed in aggressive ACC and represents a reliable prognostic indicator. FSCN1 has been shown to synergize with the Rho/Rac GEF VAV2 in enhancing the invasion properties of ACC cancer cells. Based on those results, we investigated the effects of FSCN1 inactivation by CRISPR/Cas9 or pharmacological blockade on the invasive properties of ACC cells, both <em>in vitro</em> and in an <em>in vivo</em> metastatic ACC zebrafish model. Here we showed that FSCN1 is a transcriptional target for Beta-catenin in H295R ACC cells and that its inactivation resulted in defects in cell attachment and proliferation. Additionally, FSCN1 knock-out modulated the expression of genes involved in cytoskeleton dynamics and cell adhesion. When SF-1 dosage was upregulated in H95R cells, activating their invasive capacities, FSCN1 knock-out reduced the number of filopodia, lamellipodia/ruffles and focal adhesions, while decreasing cell invasion in Matrigel. Similar effects were produced by the FSCN1 inhibitor G2-044, which also diminished the invasion of ACC cell lines (CU-ACC2, JIL-2266, MUC-1) expressing lower levels of FSCN1 than H295R. In the zebrafish model, metastases formation was significantly reduced in FSCN1 knock-out cells and G2-044 significantly reduced the number of metastases formed by ACC cells. Our results indicate that FSCN1 represents a new druggable target for ACC and provide the rationale for future clinical trials with FSCN1 inhibitors in patients with ACC, possibly in combination with immunotherapy.</p>",

H295R/TR SF-1 GFP luc (a H295R subclone with Dox-inducible overexpression of the transcription factor SF-1)<strong>[1]</strong>, MUC-1<strong>[2]</strong>, CUACC2 (RRID:CVCL_RQ01)<strong>[3]</strong> and JIL-2266 cells<strong>[4]</strong> were generated in the authors\u2019 laboratories and cultured as described<strong>[1]-[4]</strong>. All cell lines were authenticated using STR profiling within the last 3 years and all experiments were performed with mycoplasma-free cells.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Establishment of CRISPR/Cas9 FSCN1 knock out in human ACC H295R/TR SF-1 GFP luc cells</strong></p><p>H295R/TR SF-1 GFP luc cells were infected with lentivirus produced using Lenti CRISPRv2 (Addgene_52961) bearing either a FSCN1 (GAAGAAGCAGATCTGGACGC)<strong>[5]</strong> or a control (CTTCCGCGGCCCGTTCAA)<strong>[6]</strong> sgRNA and selected with puromycin. A total of 4 clones, 2 control (ctrl 1 and ctrl 2) and 2 FSCN1 knock-out (KO) clones (FSCN1 KO 1 and FSCN1 KO 2) were selected for further studies. They were cultured in DMEM-F12 (Invitrogen) supplemented with penicillin-streptomycin, 2% NuSerum (BD), 1% ITS+ (BD), and blasticidin (5 \u03bcg/mL)-zeocin (100 \u03bcg/mL) (both from Cayla InvivoGen). To identify the mutations caused by CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing in the region targeted by the sgRNA against FSCN1, genomic DNA from FSCN1 KO clones was extracted by the GenElute Mammalian Genomic DNA Miniprep kit (Sigma-Aldrich) and amplified by PCR using primers 5\u2019-GCAGCCGAACAAAGGAGCAGCAGG-3\u2019 (forward) and 5\u2019-CGTCGTCGTGCGCCACGATGAGG-3\u2019 (reverse). The PCR products were then sequenced to confirm the presence of mutations. Potential off-target mutations induced by the FSCN1 sgRNA were predicted by the use of the <em>in silico</em> tools CCTop (https://cctop.cos.uniheidelberg. de:8043), COSMID (https://crispr.bme.gatech.edu), CRISPOR (http://crispor.tefor.net) and Off-Spotter (https://cm.jefferson.edu/Off-Spotter). On the basis of those analyses a list of the top 20 exonic off-target sites was established. To verify the absence of potential mutations in those sites, genomic DNA was extracted from FSCN1 KO clones (see above) and amplified by PCR, then PCR products were sequenced. No off-target mutation in the potential off-target sites was present. The list of the couple of PCR primers employed for each potential off-target site is available upon request. Absence of FSCN1 expression in the established KO clones was confirmed by immunoblotting.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Steroid hormone profiling</strong></p><p>Control and FSCN1 KO H295R cells were treated for 24 h with vehicle or forskolin (FSK, 10 \u03bcg/mL). At the end of the treatment the supernatants were collected and steroid hormone profiling was carried out by LC-MS/MS. Samples were precleaned by off-line solid-phase extraction and analytes were separated by an Agilent 1290 UHPLC system. Steroids were measured in MRM mode with an QTRAP 6500+ (Sciex, Framingham) mass spectrometer. Details are described elsewere<strong>[7]</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Metabolomics</strong></p><p>Untargeted metabolomic analysis was performed on duplicates of each H295R clone (control 1 and 2 and FSCN1 KO 1 and 2). One million cells were pelleted at 200 x g for 10 min and extracted with a methanol:water mix (3:1, v/v) contaning 1% formic acid.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Ruggiero C, Doghman-Bouguerra M, Sbiera S, Sbiera I, Parsons M, Ragazzon B, Morin A, Robidel E, Favier J, Bertherat J, Fassnacht M, Lalli E.
