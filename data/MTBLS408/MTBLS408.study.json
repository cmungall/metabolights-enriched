                "description": "Psoriasis is a common and chronic inflammatory skin disease complicated by genetic-environmental interactions. Although genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic analyses have been performed to investigate the pathogenesis of psoriasis, the role of metabolites in psoriasis, particularly of lipids, remains unclear. Lipids not only comprise the bulk of the cellular membrane bilayers but also regulate a variety of biological processes, such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, immunity, angiogenesis and inflammation. In this study, an untargeted lipidomics approach was used to study the lipid profiles in psoriasis and identify lipid metabolite signatures for psoriasis through ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry. Plasma samples from 90 participants (45 healthy and 45 psoriasis patients) were collected and detected. Statistical analysis was applied to find different features between the disease and control groups. In addition, ELISA was performed to examine differentially-expressed lipids in psoriatic patient plasma. We finally identified several differential expression lipids including LPAs, LysoPCs, PIs, PCs and PAs, among these metabolites, LPAs, LysoPCs and PAs were significantly increased, while PCs and PIs were down-regulated in psoriasis group. We found that elements of the glycerophospholipid metabolism, such as LPAs, LysoPCs, PAs, PIs, and PCs, were significantly altered in the plasma of psoriatic patients. This investigation characterizes the circulating lipids in psoriatic patients and provides novel insights into the pathogenesis of psoriasis.",

All sample donors provided signed consent forms, which were approved by the Xiangya Hospital Committee of Ethics. Mild and moderate-severe psoriasis patients (defined as having a psoriasis area and severity index (PASI)>10) were recruited from a cohort of patients with new-onset psoriasis who did not require systemic therapy and were therefore only treated topically. None of the patients were on prescribed anti-inflammatory drugs. All samples were obtained prior to the commencement of any treatment. The recruited participants consisted of 90 gender-balanced individuals (45 healthy controls and 20 mild and 25 moderate-severe psoriasis patients). For analysis purposes, the full cohort (n=90) was subdivided into two gender- and disease  groups (n=45 each), referred to as the exploratory and validation cohorts (Table 1 of paper associated with this study). After fasting overnight, 10 ml of whole blood was collected from each subject into EDTA tubes. Samples were left standing for 1 h before centrifugation at room temperature for 20 min at 3100 rpm. After centrifugation, plasma samples were collected and immediately stored at -80 \u00b0C until use. Psoriasis was judged as severe when it required systemic therapy and according to the PASI, which is an established measurement that quantifies the thickness, redness, scaling, and distribution of psoriasis lesions.</br>",

After 10 min of incubation at room temperature, the samples were stored overnight at -20 \u00b0C to improve protein precipitation and then centrifuged at 14,000 g for 20 min. Subsequently, 20 \u03bcl of the organic phase was collected and diluted in 180 \u03bcl of isopropyl alcohol (IPA)/acetonitrile (ACN)/H2O (2:1:1 v:v:v) and stored at -80 \u00b0C until MS analysis. The analytical workflow is summarized in Fig. S-1b in the Supporting Information of the paper associated with this study. For the system conditioning and quality control (QC) process, 10 \u03bcl extracts from each of the 90 samples were mixed as the QC samples.",

Over the next 3.9 min, the gradient was increased to 54% B, and the amount of B was increased to 70% during next 0.1 min. In the final part of the gradient, B was increased to 99% and maintained for 1.9 min. Finally, B was returned to 40% over the next 0.1 min and equilibrated for 1.9 min for the next injection",
