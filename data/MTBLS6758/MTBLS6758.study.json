                "description": "Glycolipids and lipids are prominent components of bacterial cell wall that play critical roles not only in maintaining the biofilm formation but also in resistance to environmental stress. PatA is an essential membrane associated acyltransferase involved in the biosynthesis of phosphatidyl-myo-inositol mannosides (PIMs), which are the key glycolipid components in the cell wall of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. However, whether or not PatA regulates the lipids synthesis and affects drugs resistance and biofilm formation in mycobacterium is unclear, and the mechanisms involved remain to be explored. Here we show that PatA can directly regulate the synthesis of glycolipids and lipids to maintain the drugs resistance and biofilm formation in Mycobacterium smegmatis. Interestingly, the INH resistance of patA-deleted mutant is significantly enhanced although its biofilm formation is reduced. This is due to PatA negative regulation the synthesis of mycolic acids through a novel mycolic acid synthesis pathway other than the FAS pathway, which could efficiently counteract the inhibition of isoniazid on mycolic acids synthesis in mycobacterium. Furthermore, PatA is highly conserved including amino acid sequences and physiological functions in mycobacterium. Therefore, PatA regulates the synthesis of glycolipids and lipids to affect drugs resistance and biofilm formation in mycobacterium. Our findings provide a novel mycolic acids synthetic pathway and novel insights into the molecular mechanism of glycolipids and lipids metabolism regulation and their correlation with bacterial physiological phenotypes.",

Then They were added into 100 mL of fresh 7H9 medium containing 30 \u03bcg/mL kanamycin and stress conditions at the indicated concentrations, and it was ensured that the initial concentrations were OD600=0.1, respectively. After that, the cultures were grown at 37 \u00b0C in a shaker at 160 rpm for 12 h.&nbsp;All strains were harvested and washed with PBS solution when wild type strains were grown to mid-log phase (OD600=1.0).
