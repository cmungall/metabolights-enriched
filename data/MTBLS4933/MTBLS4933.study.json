                "description": "<p>Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) refers to nervous system damage caused by perinatal hypoxia, which is the major cause of long-term neuro-developmental disorders in surviving infants. However, the mechanisms still require further investigation. In this study, we found that the butanoate metabolism pathway exhibited significantly decreased and short chain fatty acid (SCFAs)-producing bacteria, especially butyrate-producing bacteria, were significantly decreased in fecal of neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain damage (HIBD) rats. Surprisingly, Sodium butyrate (SB) treatment could ameliorate pathological damage both in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus and facilitate recovery of SCFAs-producing bacteria related to metabolic pathways in neonatal HIBD rats. Moreover, we found that in samples from SB treatment neonatal HIBD rats cortex with high levels of butyrate acid along with aberrant key crotonyl-CoA-producing enzymes ACADS levels was observed compared HIBD rats. We also demonstrated that a decrease in histone 3-lysine 9-crotonylation (H3K9cr) downregulated expression of the HIE-related neurotrophic genes Bdnf, Gdnf, Cdnf and Manf in HIBD rats. Furthermore, SB restored H3K9cr binding to HIE-related neurotrophic genes. Collectively, our results indicate that SB contributes to ameliorate pathological of HIBD by altering gut microbiota and brain SCFAs levels subsequently affecting histone crotonylation-mediated neurotrophic-related genes expression. This may be a novel microbiological approach for preventing and treating HIE.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Targeted SCFA brain metabolomics</strong>&nbsp;is reported in the current study&nbsp;<a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS4933' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS4933</strong></a>.</p><p><strong>Untargeted fecal metabolomics</strong> is reported in <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS4932' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS4932</strong></a>.</p>",

The Ethics Committee of Central Hospital Affiliated to Shandong First Medical University, Shandong, China, approved all protocols used in this study (JNCH2021-58), and procedures involving animal handling comply with institutional guidelines for the care of laboratory animals.</p><p><br></p><p>The hypoxic-ischemic (<strong>HIBD</strong>) model was referenced by the classical RiceVannucci method<strong>[1]</strong>. A total of P7-P10 rats\u2019 pups, weighing 13-16 g was used and anesthetized with chloral hydrate (200 mg/kg). Subsequently, the left common carotid artery was exposed and permanently ligate using sutures. After the wound suturing and the blood drying, the rats\u2019 pups were returned to their mother. After awakening, the pups were placed in a closed chamber containing 8% O2 and 92% N2 for 2 h. The <strong>Sham</strong> group pups underwent artery exposure, but without any ligation and hypoxia. Pups were kept in a warm condition to remain body temperature through all processes.</p><p><br></p><p>The pups were treated intragastrically with <strong>Sodium butyrate</strong> (<strong>SB</strong>, 100 mg/kg, Sigma-303410) at doses of 100 \u00b5L once daily for successive 2 weeks. The <strong>Sham</strong> and <strong>HIBD</strong> groups rats were treated with SAL at doses of 100 \u00b5L as the vehicle control.</p><p><br></p><p>Briefly, after deeply anesthetized with chloral hydrate (200 mg/kg), the rats pups in <strong>Sham</strong>, <strong>HIBD</strong> and <strong>HIBD+SB</strong> groups were perfused with physiological saline from the right auricle until the liver turns white. The brain of rats was removed on ice, put into an ice-cold PBS and rapidly separated the infarct side cerebral cortex (including periinfarct tissue) and hippocampus, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and then stored at -80 \u00b0C for following molecular experiments.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Rice JE 3rd, 1981</p>",
