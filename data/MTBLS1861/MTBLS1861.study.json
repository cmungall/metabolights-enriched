                "description": "<p>Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based untargeted metabolomics studies require high-quality spectral libraries for reliable metabolite identification. We have constructed EMBL-MCF (European Molecular Biology Laboratory-Metabolomics Core Facility), an open LC-MS/MS spectral library that currently contains over 1600 fragmentation spectra from 435 authentic standards of endogenous metabolites and lipids. The unique features of the library include the presence of chromatographic profiles acquired with different LC-MS methods and coverage of different adduct ions. The library covers many biologically important metabolites with some unique metabolites and lipids as compared with other public libraries. The EMBL-MCF spectral library is created and shared using an in-house-developed web application at https://curatr.mcf.embl.de/. The library is freely available online and also integrated with other mass spectral repositories.</p>",

About 1 mg/mL stock solutions were prepared in methanol/H2O (50:50; v/v) for primary metabolites and in methanol:isopropanol (50:50, v/v) for lipids. The equal volumes of stock solutions were combined to yield a mixture of 10 to 15 non-isobaric compounds at a concentration of about 10 \u03bcg/mL (standards mix). The \u2018standards mix\u2019 were then further 10x diluted in respective mobile phases to obtain a final concentration of about 1 \u03bcg/mL for each compound (injection mix). The 10\u03bcL of each \u2018injection mix\u2019 was injected into the LC-MS system. In the case of IROA MSMLS kit; standards were diluted in water-methanol (50:50; v/v) or in methanol (as recommended by the supplier; IROA Technologies) to get a final concentration of 25 \u03bcg/mL. The \u2018standards mix\u2019 and \u2018injection mix\u2019 were then generated in a similar manner to obtain the same concentrations.

Our in-house developed web application \u2018curatr\u2019 was used for curation, cataloging, and sharing the mass spectral library online.1</p><p>The overall workflow for creating the spectral library is described in Figure 1 of the manuscript. All acquired LC-MS/MS raw files were converted to centroid mzML format29 using MSConvert software (ProteoWizard version 3).30 A mzML file of standard mixtures was then uploaded on \u2018curatr\u2019 web-application.1 The metadata and other relevant parameters are listed in Supplementary Methods. The detailed video protocol for browsing, download, curation using \u2018curatr\u2019 web application is available on the website.&nbsp;</p><p>The curation of the LC-MS/MS spectra is a key part of this work and was performed by expert mass spectrometrists using online visualization and curation features \u2018curatr\u2019 web application. Curatr automates the process of extracting the possible chromatograms and fragmentation spectra for a metabolite taking relevant adducts into account and presents the user with several spectra to choose from, along with quality metrics criteria and metadata information (Figure 1). As shown in Figure 1; the first step of curation was an evaluation of the quality of extracted ion chromatogram (XIC) for optimal retention, acceptable peak shape, and peak intensity. Once the XIC profile is acceptable then each MS/MS spectra across the peak were checked for intensity (&gt; 104 units), presence of precursor fraction (&gt; 0.1), and fragmentation pattern consistency across chromatographic elution profile. Next, the spectra were interpreted manually for their fragmentation patterns. Based on these criteria each MS/MS spectra is either accepted or rejected. The accepted spectra are then stored with the molecule along with its metadata. The rejected spectra are then discarded from the database. A convenient feature of \u2018curatr\u2019 is that it automatically catalogs and displays multiple MS/MS spectra curated for the same standard using different LC-MS protocols systematically in a single browser window. For each curated MS/MS spectra, the method details and overlay precursor XIC profiles are displayed in a browser window. For example; https://curatr.mcf.embl.de/inventory/inventory132/</p>",
