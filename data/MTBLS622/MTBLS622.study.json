                "description": "<p><strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong> The aphid Rhopalosiphum padi L. is a vector of Barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) in wheat and other economically important cereal crops. Increased atmospheric CO2 has been shown to alter plant growth and metabolism, enhancing BYDV disease in wheat. However, the biochemical influences on aphid metabolism are not known.</p><p><strong>OBJECTIVES:</strong> This work aims to determine whether altered host-plant quality, influenced by virus infection and elevated CO2, impacts aphid weight and metabolism.</p><p><strong>METHODS:</strong> Untargeted 1H NMR metabolomics coupled with multivariate statistics were employed to profile the metabolism of R. padi reared on virus-infected and non-infected (sham-inoculated) wheat grown under ambient CO2 (aCO2, 400 \u00b5mol mol\u22121) and future, predicted elevated CO2 (eCO2, 650 \u00b5mol mol\u22121) concentrations. Un-colonised wheat was also profiled to observe changes to host-plant quality (i.e., amino acids and sugars).</p><p><strong>RESULTS:</strong> The direct impacts of virus or eCO2 were compared. Virus presence increased aphid weight under aCO2 but decreased weight under eCO2; whilst eCO2 increased non-viruliferous (sham) aphid weight but decreased viruliferous aphid weight. Discriminatory metabolites due to eCO2 were succinate and sucrose (in sham wheat), glucose, choline and betaine (in infected wheat), and threonine, lactate, alanine, GABA, glutamine, glutamate and asparagine (in aphids), irrespective of virus presence. Discriminatory metabolites due to virus presence were alanine, GABA, succinate and betaine (in wheat) and threonine and lactate (in aphids), irrespective of CO2 treatment.</p><p><strong>CONCLUSION:</strong> This study confirms that virus and eCO2 alter host-plant quality, and these differences are reflected by aphid weight and metabolism.</p>",

                        "description": "Female clonal Rhopalosiphum padi aphid colonies, wheat seeds (Triticum aestivum L. cv. Yitpi) and an Australian strain of BYDV-PAV (BYDV-Padi avenae virus) were collected from oat plants (Avena sativa L.) grown at the Department of Economic Development, Jobs, Transport and Resources (DEDJTR), Horsham. Wheat cultivation, aphid rearing, and virus inoculations were followed accordingly, as previously described[1]. A growth chamber (model TPG-1260-TH, Thermoline) experiment was designed to best represent the colonisation of R. padi aphids on BYDV-PAV-infected or non-infected wheat under current ambient CO2 (aCO2, \u2018A\u2019 at 400 \u00b5mol/mol) versus future predicted elevated CO2 (eCO2, \u2018E\u2019 at 650 \u00b5mol/mol) concentrations. Therefore, 2 wheat virus/vector treatments were used: \u2018V\u2019, virus-inoculated/infected (plants exposed to viruliferous aphids) and \u2018S\u2019, sham-inoculated controls (sham-inoculated plants exposed to non-viruliferous aphids). The chamber conditions were maintained and logged at 20 \u00b0C, 70% r.h (WatchDog A 160, Spectrum Technologies Inc.) with a photoperiod of 14 h light:10 h dark. Light intensities at shelf level were measured at ~700 \u00b5mol/m^2/s (LightScout PAR Quantum light sensor connected to a WatchDog 1525 Micro Station, Spectrum Technologies Inc.). Aphids were deemed viruliferous after continuous feeding from BYDV-PAV symptomatic wheat in which virus presence was confirmed via RT-PCR using BYDV-PAV as the target amplicon[2]. Aphids used for sham inoculations were deemed virus-free after being reared on wheat which tested negative for BYDV-PAV infection.\n</p>\n2 sets of plants were required for the acclimatisation and collection of aphids. The \u2018stock\u2019 plants were grown under aCO2 for 35 days (growth conditions as above) before 10 non-viruliferous aphids were introduced. These were then exposed to eCO2 until 56 days in which successive aphid generations would have acclimatised to the higher CO2 concentration. Meanwhile, the \u2018experimental\u2019 plants were also grown at aCO2 until 10 days before half were either virus or sham-inoculated. The aphids were removed after a 3-day transmission/feeding period and the plants were exposed to the 2 CO2 treatments up until 56 days. Here, wheat height (from the base of the plant to longest leaf tip), total tiller number and BYDV-PAV severity (the number of yellow/streaked symptomatic leaves divided by the total number of leaves per plant) were assessed. Acclimatised aphids were then introduced to the experimental wheat and left to colonise the plants.\n</p>\nAdult apterous (winged) aphids (10\u201310.1 mg, pooled) were collected from the foliage of the experimental plants at 70 days. 12 biological replicates were used for each aphid treatment: i.e., sham aphids collected from non-infected (sham-inoculated) wheat grown under either aCO2 or eCO2; or viruliferous aphids collected from virus-infected wheat grown under aCO2 or eCO2. The aphids were immediately snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C.\n</p>\nFreeze dried, ground shoots of un-colonised (previously sham- and virus-inoculated) wheat plants were used to discern the influence of virus and CO2 treatment without the influence of continued herbivory caused by aphid colonisation[1]. These tissues were extracted (as below).\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Vassiliadis S, Plummer K, Powell K, Tr\u0119bicki P, Luck J, & Rochfort, S. (2016).

Due to the untargeted, non-quantitative approach of the study, an internal standard was not employed. Instead, wheat samples were referenced to the residual methanol peak at \u03b4 3.31 whilst aphid samples were references to the \u03b1-glucose anomer peak at \u03b4 5.22. Strict extraction protocols (including homogenised tissues, weight variabilities of less than 1%, numerous biological replicates, and pooled samples) minimised variation during the sample preparation. This was supported by further statistical modelling in which the replicates fell within a 95% confidence level (see below).\n</p>\nA total of 114 wheat and 48 aphid spectra were imported into MatLab v.R20017a (Mathworks, USA). Data were imported over 0.2-10 ppm range with 52,478 (wheat) and 29,555 (aphid) data points. The residual water peak was manually removed from the aphid spectra at 4.500-4.700 ppm, whilst the residual water and methanol peaks were removed from the wheat spectra at 4.808-4.888 and 3.305-3.325 ppm, respectively.",
