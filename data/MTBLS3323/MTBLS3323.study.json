                "description": "<p>Marine viruses play a key role in regulating phytoplankton populations, greatly affecting the biogeochemical cycling of major nutrients in the ocean. Resistance to viral infection has been reported for various phytoplankton species under laboratory conditions. Nevertheless, the occurrence of resistant cells in natural populations is underexplored due to the lack of sensitive tools to detect these rare phenotypes. Consequently, our current understanding of the ecological importance of resistance and its underlying mechanisms is limited. Here, we sought to identify lipid biomarkers for the resistance of the bloom-forming alga <em>Emiliania huxleyi</em> to its specific virus, <em>E. huxleyi</em> virus (EhV). By applying an untargeted lipidomics approach, we identified a group of glycosphingolipid (GSL) biomarkers that characterize resistant <em>E. huxleyi</em> strains and were thus termed resistance-specific GSLs (resGSLs). Further, we detected these lipid biomarkers in <em>E. huxleyi</em> isolates collected from induced <em>E. huxleyi</em> blooms and in samples collected during an open-ocean <em>E. huxleyi</em> bloom, indicating that resistant cells predominantly occur during the demise phase of the bloom. Last, we show that the GSL composition of <em>E. huxleyi</em> cultures that recover following infection and gain resistance to the virus resembles that of resistant strains. These findings highlight the metabolic plasticity and coevolution of the GSL biosynthetic pathway and underscore its central part in this host-virus arms race.</p>",

Genomic and transcriptomic data of <em>E. huxleyi</em> 2090, 374 and 379 are publicly available<strong>[1]-[3]</strong>. <em>E. huxleyi</em> strains were infected with the lytic virus EhV201<strong>[4]</strong>, whose genome data is publicly available<strong>[5]</strong>. Additionally, 4 <em>E. huxleyi</em> strains, which were isolated during a mesocosm experiment (see below), were used for a targeted analysis of GSL composition: RCC6912, RCC6918, RCC6936 and RCC6961. Isolates RCC6912, RCC6918, RCC6936 are susceptible to viral infection by EhV strain M1 (EhVM1), while isolate RCC6961 is resistant. The lytic virus EhVM1 was isolated during the same mesocosm experiment and its genome data is publicly available<strong>[6]</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p>A mesocosm experiment (AQUACOSM VIMS-Ehux) was carried out over 24 days (May 24-June 17, 2018) in Raunefjorden at the University of Bergen\u2019s Marine Biological Station Espegrend, Norway (60.38\u00b0 N; 5.28\u00b0 E),&nbsp;as previously described<strong>[7][8]</strong>. Briefly, the experiment consisted of 7 enclosure bags made of transparent polyethylene (11 m^3, 4 m deep and 2 m wide, 90% photosynthetically active radiation) mounted on floating frames and moored to a raft stationed in the fjord. Each bag was filled with surrounding fjord water and supplemented with nutrients.</p><p><br></p><p>To isolate <em>E. huxleyi</em> strains from the mesocosm experiment, water samples were collected, and single <em>E. huxleyi</em> cells were sorted within 2 weeks after collection at the Roscoff Culture Collection (RCC) laboratories (<a href='https://roscoff-culture-collection.org' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>https://roscoff-culture-collection.org</a>). <em>E. huxleyi</em> RCC6912 and RCC6918 were isolated from bag 1 at day 10 of the experiment (June 3, 2018), during the bloom phase of <em>E. huxleyi</em>. <em>E. huxleyi</em> RCC6936 was isolated from bag 4 at day 13 of the experiment (June 6, 2018), also during the bloom phase of <em>E. huxleyi</em>.

Briefly, biological triplicates were divided into 3 batches, with 32 samples in each batch. Filters were placed in 15 mL glass tubes and extracted with 3 mL of a pre-cooled (-20 \u00b0C) methanol:methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE; 1:3, \u03bd:\u03bd) solution containing sphingolipid standard mixture (~150 nM of each species). The samples were shaken for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C and sonicated for 30 min. The samples were then supplemented with 1.5 mL water:methanol (3:1, \u03bd:\u03bd) solution, vortexed for 1 min and centrifuged for 10 min at 3200 x g and 4 \u00b0C. The upper organic phase (1.5 mL) was transferred to 2 mL centrifuge tubes and dried under a flow of nitrogen&nbsp;(TurboVap LV, Biotage, Uppsala, Sweden). The polar phase was re-extracted with 1.5 mL of MTBE.

The column was maintained at 40 \u00b0C and the flow rate of the mobile phase was 0.4 mL per min. The chromatographic gradient was set as follows: 1.0 min 45% A, linear decrease from 45 to 35% A over 3.0 min, from 35 to 11% A over 8.0 min and from 11 to 0% A over 3.0 min, after which the column was first washed with 100% B for 4.0 min and then returned to initial conditions over 0.5 min and equilibrated for 2.5 min (i.e.., 22 min total runtime).

The elbow method was applied to determine the number of clusters for a subset of samples (without addition of EhV, 48 samples, k = 4) and for the whole dataset (without and with addition of EhV, 96 samples, k = 4) followed by k-Means clustering and PCA analysis using the <strong>R</strong> package \u2018<strong>factoextra</strong>\u2019<strong>[4]</strong> for both the subset and the whole dataset.</p><p><br></p><p>Comparative analysis between clusters 3, 4 (containing samples of resistant strains) and clusters 1, 2 (containing samples of susceptible strains) in the subset without addition of EhV was performed by one-way ANOVA with FDR-correction (p &lt; 0.01) using the <strong>R</strong> package \u2018<strong>qvalue</strong>\u2019<strong>[5]</strong>, reducing the data to approximately 10,922 mass features. The mean intensity of each mass feature was then calculated for all clusters, followed by calculation of the fold change between the cluster with the maximum mean intensity and the other clusters. A fold change of &gt; 20 between the first and third highest clusters was selected, yielding a list of 173 differential mass features, which underwent further manual annotation to obtain a smaller number of feature groups. The peak shape of the extracted ion chromatograms (EICs) from co-eluting mass features was compared using <strong>MassLynx</strong> (Version 4.1, Waters), and isotopes, adducts and apparent neutral losses (e.g., of water) were annotated, grouping the mass features into 43 feature groups (<strong>Table S1</strong>). Next, the adduct ion with the highest intensity was selected for each feature group and the corresponding peak area was extracted using <strong>MassLynx</strong> and <strong>QuanLynx</strong> (Version 4.1, Waters) across samples in the full dataset (that is, without and with addition of EhV). Peak areas above a signal-to-noise threshold of 10 (limit of quantification) were normalized to the TIC. Per feature, zero values were replaced with half of the minimal value. Hierarchical cluster analysis was then applied to the whole data set and to the dataset after averaging the peak areas of the biological replicates following log-transformation using <strong>Matlab</strong> R2016b, with row-wise (per feature) scaling, row- and column-wise clustering using the default \u2018Eucledian\u2019 method and the \u2018redblue\u2019 colour panel. Out of the 43 feature groups, nine were putatively identified as GSLs following manual annotation, based on the accurate mass, adducts and apparent in-source fragments.</p><p><br></p><p>Quantification and phenotypic grouping of the GSL species (<strong>Table 1</strong>) was based on their abundance profiles in the different <em>E. huxleyi</em> strains, without and with addition of EhV. The abundance profiles were generated by normalizing the peak area of each GSL species (extracted as described above) to the extraction standard (glucosylceramide d18:1/c12:0) and to the total number of extracted cells. Absolute quantification of GSL species from <em>E.&nbsp;huxleyi</em>&nbsp;cultures of mesocosm isolates was performed as described above.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Mesocosm experiment:</strong></p><p>Absolute quantification of GSL species was mostly performed by extracting the peak area of the adduct ion with the highest intensity ([M+Na]+) at the MSe channel using <strong>QuanLynx</strong>. Peak areas above a signal-to-noise threshold of 10 (limit of quantification) were normalized to the internal standard and the filtered volume.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Team RC.
