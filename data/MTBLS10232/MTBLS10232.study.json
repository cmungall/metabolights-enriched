                "description": "<p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> Studies have reported clinical heterogeneity between right-sided colon cancer (RCC) and left-sided colon cancer (LCC). However, none of these studies used multi-omics analysis combining genetic regulation, microbiota and metabolites to explain the site-specific difference.</p><p><strong>METHODS:</strong> Here, 494 participants from a 16S rRNA gene sequencing cohort (50 RCC, 114 LCC and 100 healthy controls) and a multi-omics cohort (63 RCC, 79 LCC and 88 healthy controls) were analyzed. 16S rRNA gene, metagenomic sequencing and metabolomics analyses of fecal samples were evaluated to identify tumor location-related bacteria and metabolites. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) and transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) were conducted to obtain the mutation burden and genomic expression pattern.</p><p><strong>RESULTS:</strong> We found unique profiles of the intestinal microbiome, metabolome, and host genome between RCC and LCC. The bacteria Flavonifractor plautii (Fp) and Fusobacterium nucleatum, the metabolites L-phenylalanine, and the host genes PHLDA1 and WBP1 were the key omics features of RCC; whereas the bacteria Bacteroides sp. A1C1 (B.A1C1) and Parvimonas micra, the metabolites L-citrulline and D-ornithine, and the host genes TCF25 and HLA-DRB5 were considered the dominant omics features in LCC. Multi-omics correlation analysis indicated that RCC-enriched Fp was related to the accumulation of the metabolite L-phenylalanine and the suppressed WBP1 signal in RCC patients. In addition, LCC-enriched B.A1C1 was associated with accumulation of the metabolites D-ornithine and L-citrulline as well as activation of the genes TCF25, HLA-DRB5 and AC079354.1.</p><p><strong>CONCLUSION:</strong> Our findings identify previously unknown links between intestinal microbiota alterations, metabolites and host genomics in RCC vs. LCC, suggesting that it may be possible to treat colorectal cancer (CRC) by targeting the gut microbiota-host interaction.</p>",

Each fecal and tissue sample was collected in a sterile tube and then stored at -80 \u00b0C prior to microbial and genomic analyses.

Ethical approval was obtained from the Institutional Review Board of Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, and written informed consent was provided by all participants before sampling.</p><p><br></p><p>This study consisted of 2 cohorts, including a 16S rRNA gene sequencing cohort (16S-seq) and a multi-omics cohort [metagenomics, metabolomics, tumor whole-exome sequencing and transcriptome sequencing (Meta/liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) / WES/RNA-seq)]. Overall, 494 patients with RCC (n=113), LCC (n=193) or healthy controls (n=188) were analyzed. The 16S-seq cohort consisted of 264 CRC patients and healthy controls whose fecal samples were collected preoperatively and detected using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Data were analyzed to search for bacteria that were associated with the tumor location: i.e., RCC (n=50), LCC (n=114) and healthy controls (control, n=100). In the multi-omics cohort, fecal samples from 230 preoperative patients with CRC and healthy controls were collected and detected by metagenomic sequencing and LC-MS to further obtain deeper insights into the gut microbiota species and metabolite identification.</p>",

It was introduced for the separation of metabolites that the mobile phase consisted of solvent A (water, 0.1% formic acid) and solvent B (acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid). The gradient elution conditions were as follows with a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min: 5% solvent B for 0.0-0.5 min; 5-100% solvent B for 0.5-7.0 min; 100% solvent B for 7.0-8.0 min; 100-5% solvent B for 8.0-8.1 min; and 5% solvent B for 8.1-10.0 min.

For the positive-ion mode, the ion spray floating voltage was set at 5 kV, and For the negative-ion mode, it was set at -4.5 kV. The MS data were acquired in the IDA mode. The TOF mass range was 60-1200 Da. Survey scans were acquired every 150 ms, and as many as 12 product ion scans were collected if the threshold of 100 counts/s was exceeded with a 1+ charge state. The total cycle time was fixed at 0.56 s. Four time bins were summed for each scan at a pulse frequency of 11 kHz by monitoring the 40 GHz multichannel TDC detector with 4-anode/channel detection. Dynamic exclusion was set for 4 s. During the entire acquisition period, the mass accuracy was calibrated every 20 samples. Furthermore, a QC sample was analyzed every 10 samples to evaluate the stability of the LC-MS.</p>",

The intensity of each peak was recorded and a 3D matrix containing arbitrarily assigned peak indices (retention time-m/z pairs), sample names (observations) and ion intensity information (variables) was generated. Then the information was matched to the in-house and public database. The open access databases, KEGG and HMDB, were used to annotate the metabolites by matching the exact molecular mass data (m/z) to those from the database within a threshold of 10 ppm. The peak intensity data was further pre-processed using metaX. Features that were detected in &lt;50% of QC samples or 80% of test samples were removed, and values for missing peaks were extrapolated with the k-nearest neighbor algorithm to further improve the data quality. PCA was performed to detect outliers and batch effects using the pre-processed dataset. QC-based robust LOESS signal correction was fitted to the QC data with respect to the order of injection to minimize signal intensity drift over time. In addition, the relative standard deviations of the metabolic features were calculated across all QC samples, and those with standard deviations &gt; 30% were removed. The group datasets were normalized before analysis was performed. Data normalization was performed on all samples using the probabilistic quotient normalization algorithm. Then, QC-robust spline batch correction was performed using QC samples. The P value analyzed by student t-tests which was then adjusted for multiple tests using an FDR (Benjamini-Hochberg) was used for the different metabolite selection. We also conducted the supervised PLS-DA using metaX to variables that discriminant profiling statistical method to identify more specific differences between the groups. The VIP cut-off value of 1.0 was set to select important features.</p>",
