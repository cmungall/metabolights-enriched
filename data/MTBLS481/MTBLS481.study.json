                "description": "Alkaline salts (e.g., NaHCO3 and Na2CO3) causes more severe morphological and physiological damage to plants than neutral salts (e.g., NaCl and Na2SO4) due to differences in pH. The mechanism by which plants respond to alkali stress is not fully understood, especially in plants having symbotic relationships such as alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.). Therefore, a study was designed to evaluate the metabolic response of the root-nodule symbiosis in alfalfa under alkali stress using comparative metabolomics. Rhizobium-nodulized (RI group) and non-nodulized (NI group) alfalfa roots were treated with 200 mmol/L NaHCO3 and, roots samples were analyzed for malondialdehydyde (MDA), proline, glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and peroxidase (POD) content. Additionally, metabolite profiling was conducted using gas chromatography combined with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC/TOF-MS). Phenotypically, the RI alfalfa exhibited a greater resistance to alkali stress than the NI plants examined. Physiological analysis and metabolic profiling revealed that RI plants accumulated more antioxidants (SOD, POD, GSH), osmolytes (sugar, glycols, proline), organic acids (succinic acid, fumaric acid, and alpha-ketoglutaric acid), and metabolites that are involved in nitrogen fixation. Our pairwise metabolomics comparisons revealed that RI alfalfa plants exhibited a distinct metabolic profile associated with alkali putative tolerance relative to NI alfalfa plants. Data provide new information about the relationship between non-nodulized, rhizobium-nodulized alfalfa and alkali resistance.",

The seeds were germinated on wet filter paper in Petri dishes in a light growth chamber (light 24 \u00b0C/dark 18 \u00b0C, 16 h/8 h) and kept moist during the germination period (relative humidity, 60%). After germinating for 5 d, the normal plants were transplanted directly into a culture pot of sandy soil; nodule plants were transplanted into the sand culture bowl after inoculation with rhizobia inoculation nodules. Each tray was loaded with 24 pots, and each pot held 3 plants (H 14 cm x D 13 cm). The plants were maintained in a greenhouse for 12 weeks (with 30 \u00b0C/25 \u00b0C day/night temperatures, 16 h of light and 40% relative humidity. Plants were irrigated twice weekly with different nutrient solutions for NI and RI samples. Normal plants were watered with 1/5 Hoagland nutrient solution. Plants with symbiotic rhizobium were watered with 1/5 Hoagland nutrient solution for the first 8 weeks and then 1/5 nitrogen-free nutrient solution for the subsequent 4 weeks to trigger nodule activation. After 12 weeks, control normal plants and control inoculating rhizobia alfalfa plants were maintained with 1/5 Hoagland nutrient solution and 1/5 nitrogen-free nutrient solution, respectively. Meanwhile, treated plants were submersed in the nutrient solution supplemented with 200 mmol/l NaHCO3[1][2]. The treatment continued for 8 d, root tissues were collected on day 0 and day 6 after administration of alkali treatment. Roots were harvested by briefly rinsing away sand and dissecting out all of the root tissues (including nodules). The harvested root samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen. Treated and control plants were harvested at the same time. 12 plants in each group (alkali stress and control group for each time point and each accession) served as the sample sources for detection of physiological compound; 6 plants from each time point served as the sample sources for metabolite extraction and metabolite profiling analysis.\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Zhu D, Li R, Liu X, Sun M, Wu J, Zhang N, Zhu Y.

                        "description": "The GC-MS was performed as previously described[1]. Briefly, 0.05 g aliquots of each sample were placed in 2-ml EP tubes. Metabolites were extracted from each tube with 0.4 ml of methanol-water (v/v = 3:1); 20 \u03bcl of Adonitol (0.2 mg/ml stock in ddH2O) was added as an internal standard. The mixture was vortexed for 30 s, homogenized in a ball mill for 3 min at 65 Hz, and then centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 \u00b0C. The resultant supernatant (~0.35 ml) was transferred to a new 2-ml GC/MS glass vial; equal volumes of each sample (14 \u03bcl) were combined in a separate 2-ml GC/MS glass vial to serve as a mixed sample for quality control. The extracts were dried in a vacuum concentrator (37 \u00b0C) for 2 h, and then 40 \u03bcl of methoxylamine hydrochloride (dissolved in pyridine, final concentration of 20 mg/ml) was added to each dried metabolite sample. The extracts were incubated at 80 \u00b0C for 20 min in an oven after mixing and sealing. The lid of each tube was opened and 50 \u03bcl of BSTFA (containing 1% TCMS, v/v) was added to each sample, and then the tubes were re-sealed and incubated for 1 h at 70 \u00b0C. Subsequently, 5 \u03bcl of FAMEs (standard mixture of fatty acid methyl esters, C8\u2013C16: 1 mg/ml; C18\u2013C24: 0.5 mg/ml in chloroform) was added to each mixed sample. The samples were allowed to cool to room temperature, and then mixed well in preparation for GC-TOF-MS analysis.\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Lisec J, Schauer N, Kopka J, Willmitzer L, Fernie AR.

The system utilized a Rxi-5Sil MS column (30 m x 250 \u03bcm inner diameter, 0.25 \u03bcm film thickness; Restek, USA). A 1-\u03bcl aliquot of the analyte was injected in splitless mode. Helium was used as the carrier gas, the front inlet purge flow was 3ml/min, and the gas flow rate through the column was 1 ml/min. The initial temperature was kept at 50 \u00b0C for 1 min, raised to 330 \u00b0C at a rate of 10 \u00b0C/min, and then kept for 5 min at 330 \u00b0C. The injection, transfer line, and ion source temperatures were 280 \u00b0C, 280 \u00b0C, and 250 \u00b0C, respectively. The energy level applied was \u221270 eV (electron impact mode). The mass spectrometry data were acquired in full-scan mode with an m/z range of 30\u2013600 at a rate of 20 spectra/s after a solvent delay of 366 s.",
