                "description": "<p>Clostridioides difficile&nbsp;(C. difficile) causes antibiotic-associated diarrhea. Susceptibility to C. difficile&nbsp;infection (CDI) is largely affected by the gut microbiota, which in turn&nbsp;is influenced by diet. However, the mechanism underlying the interplay between diet and the gut microbiota that regulates host susceptibility to CDI remains unclear. To investigate&nbsp;the effects of a high-iron diet on the intestinal immune response, microbiota, and metabolism in mice infected with C. difficile, we explored the specific role&nbsp;of the unique gut microbiota and metabolites on&nbsp;CDI. A mouse model of CDI was constructed with or without high dietary iron&nbsp;treatment. High dietary iron (400 mg/kg ferrous sulfate) alleviated CDI by decreasing the pathogenicity of C. difficile&nbsp;and altering host intestinal neutrophil recruitment.&nbsp;The effect of high iron levels on the gut&nbsp;microbiota&nbsp;was&nbsp;analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and the role of gut&nbsp;microbiota&nbsp;was confirmed by fecal microbiota transplantation&nbsp;(FMT). Furthermore, E. coli AVS0501,&nbsp;enriched in the gut microbiota of iron-treated CDI mice, was found to have prophylactic and therapeutic effects on CDI. Moreover, the production of L-proline and&nbsp;tauroursodeoxycholic acid&nbsp;(TUDCA)&nbsp;in CDI mice treated with high dietary iron directly determines the colonization and toxin production&nbsp;of C. difficile, and in turn, regulates the intestinal neutrophil response. In summary, high dietary iron alleviates C. difficile&nbsp;induced enteritis by regulating gut microbiota. Overall, the interplay between dietary iron and gut microbiota maintains gut homeostasis in CDI&nbsp;and determines the severity of CDI, suggesting that high dietary iron may be an important determinant of disease control.</p>",

To reduce the errors caused by sample preparation and instrument instability, the response intensity of the sample mass spectrum peaks was normalized by the sum normalization method, and the normalized data matrix was obtained. At the same time, variables with relative standard deviation (RSD) &gt; 30% of QC samples were removed, and log10 logarithmization was performed to obtain the final data matrix for subsequent analysis.</p><p><br></p><p>Metabolites with similar expression patterns are usually functionally related. The metabolites in the selected metabolic concentration were analyzed by cluster analysis, including cluster heat map and subcluster trend chart. Hierarchical clustering was used for sample and amino acid clustering analysis.

According to the information of metabolite alignment to KEGG compound ID, the metabolic pathway information involved in metabolites can be obtained, so as to evaluate their impact on the biological metabolic process. The enrichment analysis of KEGG pathway refers to the enrichment analysis of the selected metabolic set, and the hypergeometric distribution algorithm is used to obtain the pathway of significant enrichment of metabolites in the metabolic set. In general, BH method is used by default to correct the p-value, and when the corrected p-value is &lt; 0.05, it is considered that there is significant enrichment in this pathway.
