                "description": "There are few studies which have addressed the impact of diagnostic urine metabolites and clinical outcomes associated with genitourinary urothelial (GU) cancer till this date. Furthermore, the longitudinal analysis of the dynamics of urine metabolites contributing to the detection of GU cancer has not yet been fully investigated; therefore, the discovery of novel diagnostic urine biomarkers is of our enormous interest. We explored the correlation of the urine metabolomics profiles to the GU cancers. The aqueous metabolites of the GU cancer and the control were also identified and analyzed through high-resolution1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Compared with the control, the urine metabolites of the tumor were studied in relation to changes over time in a linear mixed model for repeated measures. The urine metabololites of eighty-two (58 males and 24 female) patients with GU cancers were systemically analyzed. The urine metabolite profile in GU cancer was significantly higher than those in the control group (p<0.05). Seven urine metabolites including histidine, propylene glycol, valine, leucine, acetylsalicylate, glycine and isoleucine as well as other pathways were identified statistically significantly associated with GU cancer detection with longitudinal analysis. We discovered that histidine, propylene glycol, valine, leucine, acetylsalicylate, glycine, isoleucine, succinic acid, lysine2-aminobutyric acid and acetic acid are involved significantly in the all types of the male patients in whom the urine metabolites of the upper tract urothelial carcinoma(UTUC) were found statistically significance compared with the control. We did not find any statistically significance in urine biomarkers between female and male patients. However, a statistically insignificant correlation was found among the grade and stage with the metabolites.",

From March 2011 to August 2019, we collected spot urine samples of enrolled subjects with <strong>GU cancer</strong>. The pathologists reviewed hematoxylin and eosin stain slides with suspected cancer. The inclusion criteria were (1) histologically confirmed transitional cell carcinoma of <strong>GU cancer</strong>, (2) surgical resection of primary <strong>GU cancer</strong>, and (3) complete pathological, surgical, treatment, and follow-up data. The <strong>control </strong>group included normal patients, benign diseases of angiolipoma, and simple renal cysts with hematoma. The number of <strong>control </strong>patients was thirteen (eight female and 5 male) patients with an average age of sixty-seven. The sample collections were started at the time of the diagnosis. Informed consent forms were signed by the patients in a tertiary referral center, with a dedicated <strong>GU cancer </strong>interdisciplinary team screening patient enrollment. The exclusion criteria were (1) patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiation therapy, (2) tumor size &lt; 1 cm on computed tomography (CT), and (3) prior to genitourinary surgery. The study was approved by the ethics committee of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital.</p><p><br></p><p>All urine samples were collected in the morning and immediately stored at -80 \u00b0C in aliquots until required.
