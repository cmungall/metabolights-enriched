                "description": "<p>Nanosecond pulsed electric field (nsPEF) is a novel ablation technique that based on high-intensity electric voltage to achieve tumor-killing effect in the target region, and increasingly considered for treating tumours of the liver, kidneys, and other organs with rich blood supply. When we were looking at the safety and feasibility of applying nsPEF on porcine livers, we found that the indicators of liver function after ablation fluctuated. To further study the influence of this technique in the treatment of liver, we collected serum and fecal specimens of the pigs pre-treatment and post-treatment. The gut microbiota of pigs was sequenced by Illumina Miseq platform for analyzing the diversity and alterations of gut microbiota. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) based metabonomic analysis and Pearson coefficient method were also used to construct the interaction system of different metabolites, metabolic pathways and flora.&nbsp;</p>",

Supervised orthogonal partial least square-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) was used to discriminate the serum metabolites that were altered after the analysis between the 2 groups of samples. The validation of OPLS-DA models was performed following the 7-fold cross-validation process. Variable importance in the projection (VIP) value was used to rank the contribution of each variable for the established OPLS-DA model. Variables with VIP value &gt; 1 were seen as significant for group discrimination. The differentially expressed metabolites were selected by combining the VIP value threshold (VIP &gt; 1) obtained by the OPLS-DA model with p-values (p&lt;0.05) from a 2-tailed Student's t test on the normalized peak areas.</p>",
