                "description": "Certain strains of the intracellular endosymbiont Wolbachia can strongly inhibit or block the transmission of viruses such as dengue by Aedes mosquitoes, and the mechanisms responsible are still not well understood. Direct infusion and liquid chromatography FT-ICR mass spectrometry based lipidomicse DIMS and LCMS analyses were conducted using Aedes albopictus Aa23 cells that were infected with the wMel and wMelPop strains of Wolbachia compared to uninfected cells. Substantial shifts in the cellular lipid profile were apparent in the presence of Wolbachia. Most significantly, sphingolipids were depleted across all classes, and some reduction in diacylglyerol fatty acids and phosphatidylcholines was also observed. These lipid classes have previously been shown to be selectively enriched in DENV-infected mosquito cells, suggesting that Wolbachia may produce a cellular lipid environment that is antagonistic to viral replication. The data improve understanding of the intracellular interactions between Wolbachia and mosquitoes.",

Eight flasks per line were independently passaged for at least 5 wks before lipid and DNA extraction. Cells were quenched 72 h after the final passage, before confluence was reached. A centrifuge was pre-chilled to -9 \u00b0C for at least 1 h and the metal fixed angle centrifuge rotor was frozen at -20 \u00b0C for 1 h to ensure rapid quenching of cells. 1.6 ml quenching solution (60:40 HPLC grade MeOH:H2O (Sigma-Aldrich)) per flask was added to pre-weighed 2 ml tubes and left on dry ice for 15 min to cool to approximately -40 \u00b0C. Cells were scraped into the flask media with minimum disruption and the cell suspension was transferred to a 15 ml tube for centrifugation at room temperature for 5 min at 1000 x g. 500 \u00b5l cell suspension was retained for DNA extraction. Supernatant was removed by pouring and cell pellets were resuspended in residual media by gently pipetting. 200 \u00b5l of this cell suspension was added to 1.6 ml quenching solution at -40 \u00b0C and mixed immediately by inversion. Samples were centrifuged in the pre-chilled rotor at -9 \u00b0C, 2500 x g  for 5 min. A maximum of 10 samples were processed at a time to ensure all were kept below 0 \u00b0C. Quenching solution was removed using a glass Pasteur pipette and the tube was weighed to estimate cell mass before being frozen at -80 \u00b0C until extraction.",

                        "description": "DIMS:</br>\nData processing was performed using NBAF-B in-house scripts in MatLab. During replicate filtering, Ppeaks were allowed if found in two out of three technical replicates and the blank filter required biological signals to be 2x the height of background signals. Sample filtering with 2 ppm error and a 75% filter resulted in a matrix containing 2044 peaks (m/z values) (see DIMS_SFPM.xlsx).\nLC-MS:</br>\nThe intensity matrix was imported into our SIMStitch pipeline immediately after the replicate filter, and hence included blank and sample filtering as for DIMS processing above (see LCMS_SFPM.xlsx).\n</p>\nAdditional compound identification (DI-MS/MS and MSn) was performed on the same instrument and is reported in the publication.\n</p>\nNormalisation:</br>\nProbabilistic quotient normalization (PQN) normalisation using in-house Matlab script, followed by filling missing values in the resulting data matrix using the knn algorithm (k=5) (see DIMS_SFPM_norm.xlsx and LCMS_SFPM_norm.xlsx).\n</p>\nG-log transformation:</br>\nScaling by G-log transform optimisation using in-house Matlab script (see DIMS_SFPM_glog.xlsx and LCMS_SFPM_glog.xlsx).\n</p>\nLC-MS data conversion:</br>\nLCMS: RPLC-FT-ICR-MS lipidomics data were initially converted into netcdf (.cdf) format using Xcalibur 2.1.\n</p>\nXCMS conversion:</br>\nNetcdf files are processed using an R based XCMS script</br>\n  library(Hmisc)</br>\n  library(xcms)</br>\n  library(CAMERA)</br>\n  xset <- xcmsSet(step=0.02,snthresh=5,mzdiff = 0.01)</br>\n  grp <- group(xset,bw=10,mzwid = 0.05)</br>\n  xsa <- annotate(grp, cor_eic_th=0)</br>\n  peaklist<-getPeaklist(xsa)</br>\n  write.csv(peaklist,'Sinkins_LCMSneg_a.csv')</br>\nto generate an intensity matrix with a list of peak retention times (see LCMS_XCMSoutput.xlsx).</br>\n</p>\nAll the Excel (.xlsx) files referenced above can be found within the study folder.",
