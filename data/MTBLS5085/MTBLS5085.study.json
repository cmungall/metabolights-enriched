                "description": "Early detection of pathogenic bacteria is needed for rapid diagnostics allowing adequate and timely treatment of infections. In this study, we show that Secondary Electro-Spray Ionization-High Resolution Mass Spectrometry (SESI-HRMS) can be used as a diagnostic tool for rapid detection of bacterial infections as a supportive system for current state of the art diagnostics. Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) produced by growing S. aureus or S. pneumoniae cultures on blood agar plates were detected within minutes and allowed for the distinction of these two bacteria on a species and even strain level within hours. Furthermore, we obtained a fingerprint of clinical patient samples within minutes of measurement and predominantly observed a separation of samples containing living bacteria compared to samples with no bacterial growth. Further development of this technique may reduce the time required for microbiological diagnosis and should help to improve patient\u2019s tailored treatment.",

The first experiment consisted of plating a high-density culture (i.e. high CFUs) by performing a subculture on a fresh blood agar plate directly from the overnight plate. In the second experiment, the initial overnight culture in agar was resuspended in PBS and diluted to obtain a low number of CFUs (i.e. low CFUs) ranging from ~140 to ~2000 CFUs per plate.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Sampling of Clinical Patient Material:</strong></p><p>17 clinical samples were obtained from 13 patients with bacterial infections requiring surgery. The description of the different clinical samples used in this study such as origin, identified bacterial pathogen, and antibiotic treatment prior to sampling is depicted in <strong>Table 1</strong> of the paper associated with this study.</p><p><br></p><p>The processing of the patient material depended on the characteristics of the sample. To verify the growth of bacteria from these samples, the original sample was divided into 2 parts, 1 for measurement by SE-SI-HRMS (see <strong>Fig 5B</strong> of the paper associated with this study) and 1 for colony plating and quantification. In short, samples such as skin, heart valves and soft tissues were processed by disrupting the tissue using a tissue lyser (Qiagen TissueLyzer, vibration frequency of 30/s for 10 min). For foreign material such as pacemakers, the processing involved an initial sonication step of 5 min using a sonicator bath (Ultrasonic bath XUBA3, Grant) in sterile PBS. Following these 2 initial steps, the remaining processing protocol was the same for all samples. The resulting suspension was washed twice with sterile PBS to remove traces of antibiotics from the sample and a final step with sterile milliQ water was used to lyse the eukaryotic cells. The sample was then serial diluted in sterile milliQ water, plated on blood agar plate and incubated at 37 \u00b0C.</p>",

                        "description": "<p>The experimental set-up consisted of a custom-made plexiglass box with an airtight closing mechanism which was directly connected to an ion source (Super SESI, FIT, Spain) coupled to a high-resolution mass spectrometer (Exactive Plus, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Germany) (see <strong>Fig 5B</strong> in the paper associated with this study). The sample (bacteria plate or clinical patient material) was placed inside the plexiglass box which was heated at 37 \u00b0C in a water bath. A mass flow controller was coupled to the box on the opposite side of the SESI-HRMS via PTFE - tubes and ensured a constant medical grade air supply through the system at a flow rate of 0.5 L/min and carried the VOCs emitted by the bacterial cultures or from the clinical material towards the SESI-HRMS. Mass spectral analysis of bacteria plates was conducted over a period of ~15 h and for 5 min in case of clinical samples. An automated switch system (<strong>Auto Click Typer version 2.0</strong>) allowed to alter between positive and negative ionization mode every 30 min when measurements were conducted for ~15 h. In addition, a high-resolution camera was placed above the box and was triggered as described in the 'bacterial plate imaging' section of the methods. In total, 36 measurements were performed whereby for both conditions (high-density and low CFUs) a total of 16 measurements were conducted each (n=4 biological replicates per strain) along with measurements of empty blood agar plates which served as control measures (n=4) for both CFU conditions.</p><p><br></p><p>To generate the electrospray in the SESI, a 20-\u00b5m ID TaperTip silica capillary emitter (New Objective, USA) and a solution of 0.1% formic acid in water were used. The pressure of the SESI solvent environment was set to 1.3 bar. Temperature of the ionization chamber and the sampling line was set to 90 \u00b0C and 130 \u00b0C respectively. The voltage of the electrospray was set to 3.7 KV in positive and 3 KV in negative ionization mode. The sheath gas flow rate was set to 10, capillary temperature was 320 \u00b0C and S-lens RF level 50.0.</p>",

Specific m/z peaks had to be excluded due noisy interferences from the mass spectrometer. Signal intensity time traces of all features were then computed and smoothed (moving mean; span = 300) for visualization purposes. The <strong>mean Area Under the Curve</strong> (mAUC) of the time traces (n=4 replicates per strain) was calculated by interpolating the data every 0.01 h. To identify features, unique to a particular bacterial strain, 2 criteria were defined; first criteria kept only features with a log2 fold change (FC) \u2265 2 in mAUC of a particular strain compared to the mAUC of the control and 2nd criteria required a log2 FC\u2265 4 in mAUC of the particular strain compared to the averaged mAUC of the other investigated strains. Furthermore, species specific time traces were identified, meaning that they had to be present in both <em>S. pneumoniae</em> strains (D39 and TIGR4) or both <em>S. aureus strains</em> (JE2 and Cowan 1). Therefore 3 criteria were defined: first criteria kept only features with a log2 FC \u2265 2 in mAUC in both strains of a particular species compared to the mAUC of the control; 2nd criteria defined to only consider the features further if within 1 species the respective strains had at least a mAUC of 30% of the mAUC of the other strain under the respective species to avoid features to be selected which tended to be rather present in 1 strain and not in both; 3rd criteria considered only features which showed a log2 FC\u2265 4 in average mAUC of the 2 strains of 1 species compared to the average mAUC of the 2 strains of the other species and vice versa. In a next step the time traces of features unique for the different strains and species were auto scaled (z-score), subjected to a <strong>hierarchical cluster tree (Ward method; Euclidean distance)</strong> and visualized as heat maps showing the evolution of the features over time. <strong>Principal Component Analysis</strong> (PCA) of <strong>5th - root transformed data matrix</strong> and a hierarchical <strong>binary cluster tree (Ward Method; Euclidean distance)</strong> were used to visually discriminate the different bacterial strains at distinctive time points over ~15 h.</p><p><br></p><p>Clinical samples were analyzed using a targeted approach, where unique positive and negative time traces of features previously identified for the different strains under high density CFU condition were directly extracted from the clinical samples raw data using in-house C  console app based on <strong>RawFileReader</strong> which resulted in a data matrix of 17 x 1269 (samples x mass spectral features).
