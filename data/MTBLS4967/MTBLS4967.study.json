                "description": "<p>Cesarean section scar diverticulum (CSD) has become a formidable obstacle preventing women receiving CS from reproducing. However, the pathogenesis of CSD remains unexplored. In this study, we characterized the cervical microbiota, metabolome and endometrial transcriptome of women with CSD. Based on the 16s rRNA results of cervical microbes, the microbial diversity in the CSD group was higher than that in the control group. <em>Lactobacillus</em> were significantly decreased in the CSD group and were mutually exclusive with potentially harmful species (<em>Sphingomonas</em>, <em>Sediminbacterium</em> and <em>Ralstonia</em>) abnormally elevated in CSD. The microbiota in the CSD group exhibited low activity in carbohydrate metabolism and high activity in fatty acid metabolism, as confrmed by the metabolomic data. The metabolomic characterization identified 6,130 metabolites, of which 34 were significantly different between the two groups. In the CSD group, N-(3-hydroxy-eicosanoid)-homoserine lactone and Ternatin were significantly increased, in addition to the marked decrease in fatty acids due to high consumption. N-(3-hydroxyeicosanoyl)-homoserine lactone is a regulator that promotes abnormal apoptosis in a variety of cells, including epithelial cells and vascular endothelial cells. This abnormal apoptosis of endometrial epithelial cells and neovascularization was also reflected in the transcriptome of the endometrium surrounding the CSD. In the endometrial transcriptome data, the upregulated genes in the CSD group were active in negatively regulating the proliferation of blood vessel endothelial cells, endothelial cells and epithelial cells. This alteration in the host\u2019s endometrium is most likely influenced by the abnormal microbiota, which appears to be confirmed in the results by integrating host transcriptome and microbiome data. For the first time, this study described the abnormal activity characteristics of microbiota and the mechanism of host-microbiota interaction in CSD.</p>",

The exclusion criteria included (i) acute pelvic inflammation, cervicitis or vaginitis; (ii) endometriosis or adenomyosis; (iii) history of tuberculosis infection; (iv) antibiotics, glucocorticoids or immunosuppressants received within a month before hysteroscopy; (v) sexual activity, vaginal irrigation or drug application within 48 h before sampling. Parous women with post-cesarean section scar diverticulum<strong>[1][2]</strong> were separated into the CSD group, and those who had vaginal deliveries were separated into the control group (CON group). All study procedures were reviewed and approved by the ethics review board of the Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University (IRB no. 2019ZSLYEC-005S).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Sample collection procession </strong></p><p>Cervix specimens were collected by using a sterile single-tipped CultureSwab. The swab was inserted into the cervix before hysteroscopy, rotated 360\u00b0, held for 10 s, removed and placed into the sterile collection tube, then stored at -80 \u00b0C, avoiding vaginal walls contact. Uterine endometrium was taken from lower segment during hysteroscopy and immersed in 1 mL of RNAsafer reagent (R4811-02, Magen, China). Endometrial specimens were stored at 4 \u00b0C overnight before transfer to -80 \u00b0C.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Schepker N, Garcia-Rocha GJ, von Versen-H\u00f6ynck F, Hillemanns P, Schippert C.

An ACQUITY UPLC HSS T3 column (1.8 \u03bcm, 2.1 x 100 mm) were employed in both positive and negative modes. The binary gradient elution system consisted of (A) water (containing 0.1 % formic acid, v/v) and (B) acetonitrile (containing 0.1 % formic acid, v/v) and separation was achieved using the following gradient: 0.0 min, 5% B; 2.0 min, 5% B; 4.0 min, 30% B; 8.0 min, 50% B; 10.0 min, 80% B; 14.0 min, 100% B; 15.0 min, 100% B; 15.1 min, 5% B and 16.0 min, 5% B. The flow rate was 0.35 mL/min and column temperature was 45 \u00b0C. All the samples were kept at 4 \u00b0C during the analysis. The injection volume was 5 \u03bcL.</p>",
