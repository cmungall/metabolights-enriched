                "description": "16S metagenomic analysis has provided much information about the intestinal microbiome. However, there are no reports that describe their appropriate taxonomic classification rank. Moreover, studies differ on the taxonomic ranking of the same microorganism. Intestinal microbiome exerts a significant degree of influence on the host via the metabolome. In the present study, we searched for their appropriate classification ranks based on the correlation between the metabolome and microbiome. Over 200 metabolites were identified by capillary electrophoresis and time-of-flight mass spectrometry (CE-TOFMS) based metabolomics of faeces from antibiotics-treated and untreated mice. Nine phyla, 15 orders, 22 classes, 40 families, and 59 genera were identified by 16S metagenomic analysis. Principle component analysis (PCA) of the intestinal microbiome at each taxonomic rank revealed differences between the antibiotic-treated and untreated groups on the first principle component in the family and genus-level analyses. These differences were similar to those found in the metabolome PCA. In addition, a strong correlation between principle component score of the metabolome and that of the microbiome was observed in the case of family and genus-level analyses. From these results, we hypothesize that lower taxonomic ranks such as family or genus are preferable while using 16S metagenome analysis for investigating the crosstalk, via metabolites, between intestinal microbiome and the host.",

(Shizuoka, Japan). These mice were bred in the Dairy Science and Technology Institute, Kyodo Milk Industry Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan. Just after their arrival, we divided mice from each breeder into two groups, untreated mice [Clea: n = 14, Charles River (Cr): n = 13, and Slc: n = 13] and antibiotics-treated mice (CleaA: n = 12, CrA: n = 13, and SlcA: n = 13). They were housed 6 ~ 7 per cage (depth 41, width 26, and height 21 cm), and given water and commercial CL-2 pellets (CLEA Japan, Inc.) ad libitum. After 5 days of preliminary breeding, the antibiotics-treated group was given water including antibiotics (1 g/l ampicillin, 1 g/l neomycin, 1 g/l metronidazole, 0.5 g/l vancomycin) ad libitum for 3 days. Faeces were collected 4th day after the antibiotics treatment. Faeces from the untreated group were collected without the antibiotics treatment. The protocols were approved by the Kyodo Milk Animal Use Committee (Permit Number: 2013-01) and all the experimental procedures were performed according to the guidelines of the Animal Care Committee of Kyodo Milk Industry Co., Ltd. and were in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the National Academies Press.",
