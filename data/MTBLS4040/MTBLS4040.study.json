                "description": "Diarrheal disease is a common health problem with complex causality. Although diarrhea is accompanied by disturbances in microbial diversity, how gut microbes are involved in the occurrence of diarrhea remains largely unknown. Here, using a pig model of post-weaning stress-induced diarrhea, we aim to elucidate and enrich the mechanistic basis of diarrhea. We found significant alterations in fecal microbiome, their metabolites, and microRNAs levels in piglets with diarrhea. Specifically, loss of ssc-miRNA-425-5p and ssc-miRNA-423-3p, which inhibit the gene expression of fumarate reductase (<i>frd</i>) in <i>Prevotella</i> genus, caused succinate accumulation in piglets, which resulted in diarrhea. Single-cell RNA sequencing indicated impaired epithelial function and increased immune response in the colon of piglet with diarrhea. Notably, the accumulated succinate increased colonic fluid secretion by regulating transepithelial Cl-secretion in the epithelial cells. Meanwhile, succinate promoted colonic inflammatory responses by activating MyD88-dependent TLR4 signaling in the macrophages. Overall, our findings expand the mechanistic basis of diarrhea and suggest that colonic accumulation of microbiota-produced succinate caused by loss of miRNAs leads to diarrhea in weanling piglets.",

During this week, all the piglets were fed diet according to the nutrient requirements of the NRC (2012) without adding any antibiotics, and they were scored the severity of diarrhea. Diarrhea index was scored as follows: <strong>1</strong> = hard feces; <strong>2</strong> = normal consistency, no scours; <strong>3</strong> = , soft partially formed, mild scours; <strong>4</strong> = loose, semi-liquid, moderate scours; <strong>5</strong> = watery feces; as previously published<strong>[1]</strong>. Those piglets with a score of <strong>4</strong> or <strong>5</strong> for 3 continuous days were designated as diarrheal piglets, while those piglets with a score of <strong>1</strong> or <strong>2</strong> for t3 continuous days were designated as healthy piglets. Fresh fecal samples were collected during the experiment. Colonic samples were collected for morphology observation, determination of inflammatory cytokines and tight junction protein expression after healthy and diarrheal piglets were slaughtered.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Sweet LA, Kornegay ET, Lindemann MD.

Total cycle time was fixed to 0.56 s. 4 time bins were summed for each scan at a pulser frequency value of 11 kHz through monitoring of the 40 GHz multichannel TDC detector with 4-anode/channel detection. Dynamic exclusion was set for 4 s. During the acquisition, the mass accuracy was calibrated every 20 samples.
