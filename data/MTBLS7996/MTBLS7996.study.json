                "description": "<p>Multidrug-resistant bacteria present a major threat to public health. Therefore, new drugs or approaches are urgently needed to manage and mitigate this threat. Here, we screen the molecular candidates that allow the survival of mice upon <em>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</em> infection by integrated proteomic and metabolomics analysis, where L-Alanine metabolism and phagocytosis are highly correlated. The role of L-Alanine on boosting mouse survival is further confirmed with <em>in vivo</em> bacterial challenge studies on bacteria including <em>V. parahaemolyticus</em>, <em>Escherichia coli</em>, <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> and <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em>. Functional studies demonstrate that exogenous L-Alanine promotes phagocytosis to these different species of multidrug-resistant pathogens. The underlying mechanism involves two events that are L-Alanine-dependently increased TLR4 expression and L-Alanine-enhanced TLR4 signaling via increasing the biosynthesis and secretion of fatty acids such as palmitate. Palmitate enhances the binding of LPS to TLR4 and thereby promotes TLR4 dimmer formation and endocytosis for the subsequent activation of PI3K/Akt and NF-\u03baB pathways and phagocytosis of bacteria. These results suggest that modulation of metabolic environment is a plausible approach for combating infection with multidrug-resistant bacteria.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>V. parahaemolyticus-infected spleen metabolomics</strong> is reported in the current study <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS7996' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS7996</strong></a>.</p><p><strong>L-Alanine-treated macrophage metabolomics</strong> is reported in <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS7986' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS7986</strong></a>.</p>",

Briefly, spleen tissues were weighed and homogenized with the first solvent (the mixture of chloroform, methanol and water (1:2:1, v/v/v)) for 30 s at 4 \u00b0C and then centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C. The supernatant was collected and deposit was re-homogenized with the second solvent (methanol alone) before a second centrifugation. The two supernatants were mixed, and aliquot of sample was transferred to a GC sampling vial containing 5 \u03bcL 0.1 mg/mL ribitol (Sigma) as an analytical internal standard and then dried in a vacuum centrifuge concentrator before the subsequent derivatization. In total 2 technical replicates were prepared for each sample.</p><p><br></p><p>Briefly, the cells were quenched with cold methanol containing 10 mL of 0.1 mg/mL ribitol (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), which served as an analytical internal standard. Cells were then lysed by sonication for 10 min and centrifuged for another 10 min at 12,000 rpm at 4 \u00b0C. The supernatant was dried in a rotary vacuum centrifuge device (LABCONCO). The dried extracts were derivatized; 80 mL of 20 mg/mL methoxyamine hydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) was added to the dried samples, mixed, and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 90 min; 80 mL N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA; Sigma-Aldrich) was added, followed by incubation at 37 \u00b0C for another 30 min.

A retention time (RT) correction was performed for all the samples, and then the RT was used as reference against which the remaining spectra were queried and a file containing the abundance information for each metabolite in all the samples was assembled. Metabolites from the GC-MS spectra were identified by searching in National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) library used the NIST MS search 2.0. The resulting data matrix was normalized using the concentrations of added internal standards which were subsequently removed so that the data could be used for modeling consisted of extracted compound. The resulting normalized peak intensities form a single matrix with Rt-m/z pairs for each file in the dataset. To reduce between-sample variation we centered the imputed metabolic measures for each tissue sample on its median value and scaled it by its inter-quartile range (IQR)<strong>[2]</strong>. In the integration of proteomic and metabolomic data set, the z-score analysis scaled each protein or metabolite according to a reference distribution. The control samples were designated as the reference distribution. Thus, the mean and standard deviation of the control samples was determined for each metabolite or protein. Then each sample was centered by the control mean and scaled by the control standard deviation, per molecule. In this way, we can know how the molecule expressions deviate from the control state.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Jiang M, Gong QY, Lai SS, Cheng ZX, Chen ZG, Zheng J, Peng B.
