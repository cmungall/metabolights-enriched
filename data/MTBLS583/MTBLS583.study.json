                "description": "Peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) is considered as a moderately salt-sensitive species and thus soil salinity can be a limiting factor for peanut cultivation. To gain insights into peanut plant physiology in response to salt stress and alleviation, we comprehensively characterized leaf relative electrolyte leakage (REC), photosynthesis, leaf transpiration, and metabolism of plants under salt stress and plants that were subjected to salt stress followed by salt alleviation period. As expected, we found that REC levels were higher when plants were subjected to salt stress compared with the untreated plants. However, in contrast to expectations, REC was even higher compared with salt treated plants when plants were transferred from salt stress to standard conditions. To decipher REC variation in response to salt stress, especial during the recovery, metabolite, and transcript variations were analyzed by GC/MS and RNA-seq method, respectively. Ninety two metabolites, among total 391 metabolites identified, varied in response to salt and 42 metabolites responded to recovery specially. Transcriptomics data showed 1,742 in shoots and 3,281 in roots transcript varied in response to salt stress and 372 in shoots and 1,386 transcripts in roots responded specifically to recovery, but not salt stress. Finally, 95 transcripts and 1 metabolite are indicated as candidates involved in REC, photosynthesis, transpiration, and Na+ accumulation variation were revealed by using the principal component analysis (PCA) and correlation analysis. This study provides valuable information on peanut response to salt stress and recovery and may inspire further study to improve salt tolerance in peanut germplasm innovation.",

The nutrient solution was changed weekly. NaCl treatments, each containing 4 replicate plants in separate pots, were as follows: Hoagland's nutrient solution with addition of 0 (Standard conditions, ST), 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, or 400 mM NaCl. Treatment began when seedlings were 18 days old. After 4 days (N4), the salt-stress recovery treatment was transferred back to standard Hoagland's solution for 3 days (R3).

Briefly, after alignment with Statistic Compare component, the CSV file was obtained with three dimension data sets including sample information, retention time-m/z, and peak intensities, The detectable peaks of plant samples in GC-MS were 355/490 in total, and the internal standard was used for data quality control (reproducibility). After internal standards and any known pseudo positive peaks, such as peaks caused by noise, column bleed, and BSTFA derivatization procedure, were removed from the data set, and the peaks from the same metabolite were combined. The data set was normalized using the sum intensity of the peaks in each sample.\n</br></br>\nThe data sets resulting from GC-MS were separately imported into SIMCA-P+ 14.0 software package (Umetrics, Ume\u00e5, Sweden). Principle component analysis (PCA) and (orthogonal) partial least-squares-discriminant analysis (O)PLS-DA were carried out to visualize the metabolic alterations among experimental groups, after mean centering and unit variance scaling. Variable importance in the projection (Variable Importance in Projection, VIP) ranks the overall contribution of each variable to the (O)PLS-DA model, and those variables with VIP > 1.0 are considered relevant for group discrimination. All of the differentially expressed compounds in treated group were selected by comparing the compounds in the treated group with the control using the multivariate statistical method and Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test. Metabolites with both multivariate and univariate statistical significance (VIP > 1.0 and p < 0.05) were annotated with the aid of available reference standards and the NIST 11 standard mass spectral databases and the Feihn database linked to ChromaTOF software.\n</br></br>\nFor this analysis, three independent biological replicates of shoot and root samples and two technical replicates were performed. The relative abundance of metabolites was presented as the average values of the six replicates. A Student's t-test with p-value < 0.05 was used for metabolite variation identification.\n</br></br>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Kind T, Wohlgemuth G, Lee DY, Lu Y, Palazoglu M, Shahbaz S, Fiehn O.
