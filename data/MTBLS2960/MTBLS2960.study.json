                "description": "<p>Lipids are an integral part of cellular membranes, vary between species, and allow cells to alter stiffness, permeability and curvature. Among lipids, phosphonolipids uniquely contain a phosphonate bond between carbon and phosphorous. Despite this distinctive biochemical characteristic, few models explore the biological role of phosphonolipids. A protective function has been inferred based on chemical and biological stability. The function of a tissue ultimately depends on its chemical makeup. Thus if the function of a tissue is known, for example, the barrier function of exposed epithelial cells, the function of an associated metabolite can be inferred. To investigate possible functions of phosphonolipids we analyzed two species of marine mollusks, the blue mussel <em>Mytilus edulis</em> and pacific oyster <em>Crassostrea gigas</em>, and determined the diversity of phosphonolipids and their distribution in different organs. High resolution spatial metabolomics revealed that the lipidome varies significantly between tissues within one organ. Despite their chemical similarity, the heterogeneity of the phosphonolipids within the lipid landscape likely reflects a functional diversity of the tissue. While some phosphonolipids are ubiquitously distributed, others are present almost exclusively in the ciliated epithelial cells. The exclusive localization of certain phosphonolipids in tissues exposed to the environment supports the hypothesis of a protective function in mollusks. This study highlights that the tissue specific distribution of an individual metabolite can be a valuable tool in inferring its function.</p>",

The homogenized tissues were transferred into a 3 mL exetainer with chloroform (8 \u00b5L/mg tissue). The exetainers were vortexed for 15 s before HPLC grade water (7.2 \u00b5L/mg tissue) was added and vortexed again for 30 s. Phase separation was allowed for 10 min. Cell debris was pelleted by a 10 min centrifugation step (4 \u00b0C, 2500 x g). The lipid fraction (organic solvent, lower phase) was transferred to a HPLC-MS vial via glass syringe. For analysis, 100 \u00b5L of a 1:10 dilution of the extract in acetonitrile was transferred to HPLC-MS vials (1.5-HRSV 9mm Screw Thread Vials, Thermo Fisher). For each organ, triplicate samples were taken from 3 specimen and a mixture of all samples from one species served as the quality control samples. All solvents were pre-chilled and the samples were kept on ice during the extraction procedure.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Bligh EG, Dyer WJ.

Slides were stored in a desiccator with silica beads (Carl Roth) under reduced pressure to avoid lipid oxidation before analysis. For all sections from gill and mantle tissue, an ionization matrix composed of a mixture of 2,5-dimethoxy and 2-hydroxy-5-methoxybenzoic acid (Super-DHB, Sigma Aldrich) in&nbsp;v/v 60% acetone, 40% water,&nbsp;0.1% TFA was applied by the SMALDIPrep sprayer (TransMIT GmbH). Over 30 min, 225 \u00b5L of a 30 mg/mL solution were deposited with nitrogen carrier gas into a chamber containing a rotating sample slide. For the <em>M. edulis</em> foot data, the ionization matrix was 2\u2032,5\u2032-Dihydroxyacetophenone (DHAP), applied as previously reported<strong>[1]</strong>,&nbsp;via a Sono-Tek SimCoat&nbsp;sprayer with ACCUMIST ultrasonic nebulizer (Sono-Tek Corporation).&nbsp;A 15 mg/mL solution of DHAP was sprayed with a flowrate of 50 \u00b5L/min at a nitrogen pressure of 1 psi and ultrasonic frequency of 48 kHz.
