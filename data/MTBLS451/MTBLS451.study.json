                "description": "Sake is a traditional Japanese alcoholic beverage prepared by multiple parallel fermentation of rice. The fermentation process of yamahai-ginjo-shikomi sake is mainly performed by three microbes, Aspergillus oryzae, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Lactobacilli; the levels of various metabolites fluctuate during the fermentation of sake. For evaluation of the fermentation process, we monitored the concentration of moderate-sized molecules (m/z: 200-1000) dynamically changed during the fermentation process of yamahai-ginjo-shikomi Japanese sake. This analysis revealed that six compounds were the main factors with characteristic differences in the fermentation process. Among the six compounds, four were leucine- or isoleucine-containing peptides and the remaining two were predicted to be small molecules. Quantification of these compounds revealed that their quantities changed during the month of fermentation process. Our metabolomic approach revealed the dynamic changes observed in moderate-sized molecules during the fermentation process of sake, and the factors found in this analysis will be candidate molecules that indicate the progress of yamahai-ginjo-shikomi sake fermentation.",

                        "description": "For detailed analysis, the main exact mass occupying each factor was extracted from spectral data. Each exact mass of \u22641000 Da was analyzed using the Kazusa Molecular Formula Searcher (http://webs2.kazusa.or.jp/mfsearcher/index_jp.html) with KEGG (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/), KNApSAcK (http://kanaya.naist.jp/KNApSAcK/) and pep1000 (http://webs2.kazusa.or.jp/mfsearcher/pep1000/) databases to predict candidate chemicals or peptides. Exact masses of \u2265 1000 Da could not be determined because of the redundancy of molecular formula. From the results of compound predictions, C17\u201329 organic compounds, including leucine- or isoleucine-rich short-chain peptides, exhibited the highest PC1 scores. These factors were predicted to characterize the fermentation process of \u201cyamahai-shikomi\u201d Japanese sake.\n</br></br>\nTo identify candidate compounds that would characterize the \u201cyamahai-shikomi\u201d sake fermentation process, we performed nanoLC-MS/MS analysis. We particularly focused on the leucine- or isoleucine-rich peptides, and the sequences of these peptides were analyzed. As a result, the peptides [Leu/Ile]\u2013[Leu/Ile]\u2013[Leu/Ile], Phe\u2013Pro\u2013[Leu/Ile], [Leu/Ile]\u2013[Leu/Ile]\u2013[Leu/Ile]\u2013Pro, and [Leu/Ile]\u2013[Leu/Ile]\u2013[Leu/Ile]\u2013[Leu/Ile]\u2013Pro were identified. All peptides contained leucine or isoleucine (represented as [Leu/Ile]). However, leucine and isoleucine could not be distinguished by MS analysis because these two amino acid residues share the same molecular weight.\n</br></br>\nNext, we tried to distinguish leucine and isoleucine residues by their retention time on chromatographic columns using (as an example) the tripeptides [Leu/Ile]\u2013[Leu/Ile]\u2013[Leu/Ile], which display 23 patterns of leucine and/or isoleucine sequence. The long-duration gradient program employed for LC using the long monolithic column was able to distinguish these tripeptides. From the chromatogram, \u201cyamahai-shikomi\u201d Japanese sake contained more than one species of peptide, and the predominant one was found to be Leu\u2013Leu\u2013Leu, indicating that peptides possessing a poly-leucine motif may be important. Moreover, putative Phe\u2013Pro\u2013[Leu/Ile] was validated as Phe\u2013Pro\u2013Leu by the retention time analysis using LC, suggesting that leucine-containing peptides are characteristic features of the fermentation process employed in \u201cyamahai-shikomi\u201d Japanese sake. The precise composition of leucine and isoleucine peptides for [Leu/Ile]\u2013[Leu/Ile]\u2013[Leu/Ile]\u2013Pro and [Leu/Ile]\u2013[Leu/Ile]\u2013[Leu/Ile]\u2013[Leu/Ile]\u2013Pro could not be identified because of the number of sequence combinations.\n",
