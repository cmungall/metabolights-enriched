                "description": "<p>The intensity and frequency of precipitation events are predicted to change over the coming decades. For many areas, longer periods without rainfall are expected. We investigated the importance of irrigation frequency under water deficit conditions for growth, physiology and chemistry of wheat (<em>Triticum aestivum</em>). Drought-stressed plants received 40% of the water provided for control plants and were either watered every other day (continuous drought, cd) or every eight days (pulsed drought, pd). Maximum quantum yield of photosystem II (Fv/Fm), aboveground biomass, applied water use efficiency (WUEapl) and the flag leaf metabolome were assessed twice during development. Fv/Fm was not affected by irrigation. Drought-exposed plants produced less biomass, but had higher WUEapl than control plants. More metabolic features responded to the pd compared to the cd treatment and more features were increased than decreased in pool size in flag leaves. Salicylic acid glucoside was generally decreased under drought. In pd plants, two benzoxazinoid glucosides were enhanced at the first time point and concentrations of several flavonoid glycosides were modulated. This study extends our knowledge about drought effects on wheat; it highlights that the frequency of watering determines how plant growth, physiology and metabolism are affected by drought.</p>",

                        "description": "<p>The experiment was performed from December 2016 to May 2017. Seeds of spring wheat (<em>T. aestivum</em> cv. Tybalt, von Borries-Eckendorf, Leopoldsh\u00f6he, Germany) were germinated in a steamed (90 \u00b0C, 8 h) 1:1 mixture of river sand and soil (Fruhstorfer Pikiererde, Hawita Group, Vechta, Germany) in a greenhouse at 22 \u00b0C, 46% relative humidity (r.h.) and a photoperiod of 12 h:12 h light:dark (L:D). Six days after sowing, five seedlings were planted together in an equal distance of 6 cm surrounding a central seedling in each of 60 pots (4 L, 15.7 \u00d7 15.7 \u00d7 23.3 cm; Meyer, Rellingen, Germany) to simulate natural competition. Each pot contained 4,185 g of the substrate mentioned above, with a substrate water content of 23% (determined gravimetrically in a previous experiment [1]). Pots had holes at the bases to allow draining and were placed on dishes to prevent water loss after leaching. Henceforward, the greenhouse settings were 11 \u00b0C at 75% r.h. and a photoperiod of 12 h:12 h L:D. Ambient light was supported by 400 W HPI-T Plus lamps (Philips, Amsterdam, Netherlands) and pot positions were initially randomly changed twice a week, from the start of the irrigation treatments onwards once a week. From five to six weeks after sowing, the temperature was increased stepwise to 14 \u00b0C (at 64% r.h.) and then to 19 \u00b0C (at 58% r.h.) and the photoperiod changed to 14 h:10 h L:D and then to 16 h:8 h L:D. After seedlings were transferred to the pots, the substrate water content was determined gravimetrically for 15 randomly chosen pots every other day, weights were averaged, and the volume of tap water needed to reach a soil water content of 23% was added to each pot. Forty six days after sowing, when stem elongation started (BBCH stage: 30 [2]), pots were randomly assigned to one of three irrigation treatments with 20 pots per group: a well-watered control (ctr), continuously drought-stressed (cd) and pulsed drought-stressed (pd) plants. Pots of the ctr treatment were adjusted to a substrate water content of 23% every other day. Pots of the drought treatments were not watered until they reached a mean gravimetric soil water content of 11% (measured from 15 randomly chosen pots that were weighed), which occurred 60 days after sowing. From 62 days after sowing onwards, cd plants were provided with 40% of the water amount that ctr plants received and watered in that way every other day. For plants of the pd treatment, the cumulative amount of water given to cd plants within 8 days (4 watering events) was provided only every 8 days, starting at 68 days after sowing. All water was retained within the pots and surrounding dishes, but evaporation from the substrate surface and the dishes was not restricted. All plants were fertilised with 5 g and 3 g of fertiliser (Plantosan N-P-K 20-10-15, containing 6% Mg, 2% S, traces of B, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Zn; Manna, D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany) at 32 and 68 days after sowing, respectively, directly before watering all pots.</p><p>Seventy seven days after sowing (T1; 31 days after start of irrigation treatments), plant heading started and first spikelets were just visible (BBCH stage: 51). At this time point the flag leaf of the main shoot was harvested from one randomly chosen surrounding plant of each pot (n = 10 per treatment) for subsequent metabolomics analysis. Flag leaves were harvested in the same way from plants of 10 other pots per treatment at a later plant age, i.e., 93 days after sowing (T2; 47 days after start of irrigation treatments), when plants had developed full inflorescences (BBCH stage: 59). The two harvests were performed one day after plants of all treatments had been watered. After harvest, flag leaves were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C.</p><p><br></p><p>References:</p><p>[1] Stallmann, J., Schweiger, R. &amp; M\u00fcller, C.

The following settings were used: signal-to-noise threshold 3, correlation coefficient threshold 0.75, minimum compound length 28 spectra, smoothing width 6, allowing common adducts and neutral losses for bucket generation. Buckets were aligned across samples using Compass ProfileAnalysis 2.3 (Bruker Daltonics) using the m/z with the highest intensity as bucketing basis and allowing deviations of 0.2 min RT (retention time) and 6 mDa (m/z), respectively. The intensities of the resulting metabolic features (each described by a RT and a m/z value) were related to the intensities of the [M + HCOOH-H]\u2212 ion of the internal standard hydrocortisone. Only those features were retained in the dataset, whose mean intensities in at least one treatment group (irrigation treatment x time point) were at least 50 times higher than their mean intensity in the blanks. Furthermore, features had to occur in at least half of the replicates of at least one treatment group. Feature intensities were divided by the sample fresh weights.</p>",

The annotation tools of MetaboScape 2.0 and Data Analysis 4.4 (Bruker Daltonics) were used. With Smart Formula 3D and/ or MetFrag [1], molecular formulas of parent ions and fragments were generated based on their m/z and isotopic pattern fit. Using MetFrag, in-silico fragmentation based on compounds listed in PubChem as well as spectral matching against entries in the MassBank of North America (https://mona.fiehnlab.ucdavis.edu/) were used to derive structure suggestions. RT, UV/VIS spectra, dominant ion types and m/z (MS and MS/MS spectra) were compared to those of reference standards listed in spectral libraries associated with the vendor software (Bruker Daltonics) and those listed in an in-house database. Identifications of BXDs and their glucosides were further validated by diagnostic ions (MS and MS/MS) [2]. C/O-glycosyl flavones, which occur in wheat but for which no reference standards were available, were putatively identified based on distinct published fragmentation patterns [3, 4].</p><p><br></p><p>References:</p><p>[1] Ruttkies, C., Schymanski, E.
