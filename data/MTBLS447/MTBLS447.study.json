                "description": "Plants can regenerate from a variety of tissues on culturing in appropriate media. However, the metabolic shifts involved in callus formation and shoot regeneration are largely unknown. The metabolic profiles of callus generated from tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) cotyledons and that of shoot regenerated from callus were compared with the pct1-2 mutant that exhibits enhanced polar auxin transport and the shr mutant that exhibits elevated nitric oxide levels. The transformation from cotyledon to callus involved a major shift in metabolite profiles with denser metabolic networks in the callus. In contrast, the transformation from callus to shoot involved minor changes in the networks. The metabolic networks in pct1-2 and shr mutants were distinct from wild type and were rewired with shifts in endogenous hormones and metabolite interactions. The callus formation was accompanied by a reduction in the levels of metabolites involved in cell wall lignification and cellular immunity. On the contrary, the levels of monoamines were upregulated in the callus and regenerated shoot. The callus formation and shoot regeneration were accompanied by an increase in salicylic acid in wild type and mutants. The transformation to the callus and also to the shoot downregulated LST8 and upregulated TOR transcript levels indicating a putative linkage between metabolic shift and TOR signalling pathway. The network analysis indicates that shift in metabolite profiles during callus formation and shoot regeneration is governed by a complex interaction between metabolites and endogenous hormones.",

Ailsa Craig, and pct1-2 (enhanced polar auxin transport mutant, and shr (NO overproducing mutant) were used. Both shr and pct1-2 mutants were monogenic recessive in nature. Seeds were surface sterilized with 4% (v/v) sodium hypochlorite, and seedlings were raised on MS (1/2X) medium supplemented with 1.5% (w/v) sucrose under 16 h light and 8 h darkness cycles. Fully expanded cotyledons from 9-10 days old seedlings were used as explant for the callus initiation. For callus induction, excised cotyledons were cut at the tip and the base (0.7 x 1.0 cm size) and were placed on MS medium (1X) supplemented with 3% (w/v) sucrose, 2 mg/l zeatin and 0.1 mg/l IAA (CIM) with their adaxial surface in contact with the medium. Explants were sub-cultured at an interval of 10-12 days by transferring to fresh plates on CIM. After the appearance of shoots, the shoots were excised from the callus and transferred to the SIM consisting of MS media supplemented with 3% (w/v) sucrose, 1 mg/l zeatin and 0.1 mg/l IAA for further differentiation and growth.",

The tissue was snap frozen and homogenized in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 \u00b0C till further use. All experimental analyses were carried out using 5 independent biological replicates at each stage from WT, shr and pct1-2.\n</p>\nThe GC-MS based identification of primary metabolites was carried out essentially using the protocol described previously[1]. Briefly, a polar metabolite fraction was extracted from 100 mg of powdered tissue by shaking with 1400 \u03bcl 100% methanol and 60 \u03bcl internal standard (0.2 mg/ml ribitol in MilliQ water) at 700 rpm for 15 min at 70 \u00b0C. The extract was vigorously mixed with 1400 \u03bcl water, centrifuged at 2200 x g at 25 \u00b0C and supernatant was collected. 300 \u03bcl aliquots of supernatant were dried in vacuo for 3 h. The dried residue was dissolved and derivatized for 90 min at 37 \u00b0C in 80 \u03bcl of pyridine containing 20 mg/ml methoxyamine hydrochloride. To the derivatized sample 80 \u03bcl N-trimethylsilyl-N-methyl trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA) and 20 \u03bcl of a retention time standard mixture (F.A.M.E. Mix, Sigma, 1 \u03bcg/\u03bcl in hexane) was added, and the mixture was incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min.\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Roessner U, Wagner C, Kopka J, Trethewey RN, Willmitzer L.

The compound hits which showed maximum matching factor (MF) value (>700) and least deviation from the retention index (RI) was used for metabolite identity. The metabolite levels were quantified by normalizing with the internal standard ribitol. During identification, the metabolites with different trimethylsilyl derivatives were clubbed together as a single entity. In addition, only annotated metabolites were taken for further study.",
