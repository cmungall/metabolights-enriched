                "description": "The sesquiterpene lactones typical of the genera Cichorium and Lactuca were historically thought to be present in the free and glycosylated form, but recent developments have highlighted the presence of highly unusual oxalyl esters. In this work, first a liquid chromatography method that requires minimal sample preparation and can measure both free and conjugated sesquiterpene lactones was developed. Then the most common sample preparation techniques used in the past studies (e.g., solid-phase extraction, liquid/liquid extraction) were evaluated and shown to introduce significant bias against the polar oxalyl-terpenes. Finally the method was applied to a case study, highlighting the effect of variety, duration and temperature of forcing on the sesquiterpene lactone content of Belgian endive.",

Three varieties were used in this study: Takine, Symphonie, and Vintor. Roots were harvested on 19/11/2013, and subsequently forced following an experimental design including three forcing temperatures (11, 16, and 21 \u02daC) and three forcing periods (14, 21, and 28 d). The combinations of 14 d at 11 \u02daC and 28 d at 21 \u02daC were not implemented as they would not produce chicons fit for consumption. Forcing started on 27/5/2014 (for 28 days of forcing), 3/6/2014 (21 days) or 10/6/2014 (14 days). All chicons were harvested on 24/6/2014 and kept refrigerated at 4 \u02daC. During the two following days, ten chicons were randomly chosen per condition for sampling. After removing the two external leaves, the remaining leaves were separated from the pit with a knife, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and ground to a fine powder in a CryoMill grindomixer MM200 (Retsch, Germany). Samples were kept in dry ice for transport to the lab, and stored subsequently at  80 \u00b0C until analysis.",

Acquisition parameters were: scan time: 0.4 s, inter-scan time: 0.1 s, reference scan (leu-enkephalin): 60 s, centroid mode, centroid threshold: 1, minimum point: 5. Integration was performed over EICs with a window of 0.02 Da around the target ion. The mass spectrometer was tuned to a resolution of 5500. Its performance was monitored daily by calibrating with a solution of sodium formate prepared according to the manufacturer\u2019s specifications, and ensuring that the residuals of the polynomial calibration were under 5 mDa. Deadtime correction (Np factor) was calculated separately for positive and negative mode by injecting increasing concentrations of leu-enkephalin and empirically measuring the correct value.",

The peaks specified in the metabolite identification table are those used for quantification (either [M+H]+ or [M+Na]+).\n</p>\nLactucin was identified on the basis of an authentic standard. Lactucin oxalate and lactucopicrin oxalate were identified based on the data of Sessa et al. [1]. Other sesquiterpenes were identified on the basis of accurate mass, isotope pattern, and mass spectra similarity to those described in literature (including regular series of neutral losses).\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Sessa, R.
