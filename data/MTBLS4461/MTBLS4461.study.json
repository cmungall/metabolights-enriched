                "description": "Direct infusion high-resolution mass spectrometry (DIHRMS) is a novel, high-throughput approach to rapidly and accurately profile hundreds of lipids in human serum without prior chromatography, facilitating in-depth lipid phenotyping for large epidemiological studies to reveal the detailed associations of individual lipids with coronary heart disease (CHD) risk factors. Intact lipid profiling by DIHRMS was performed on 5662 serum samples from healthy participants in the Pakistan Risk of Myocardial Infarction Study (PROMIS). We developed a novel semi-targeted peak-picking algorithm to detect mass-to-charge ratios in positive and negative ionization modes. We analyzed lipid partial correlations, assessed the association of lipid principal components with established CHD risk factors and genetic variants, and examined differences between lipids for a common genetic polymorphism. The DIHRMS method provided information on 360 lipids (including fatty acyls, glycerolipids, glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, and sterol lipids), with a median coefficient of variation of 11.6% (range: 5.4-51.9). The lipids were highly correlated and exhibited a range of associations with clinical chemistry biomarkers and lifestyle factors. This platform can provide many novel insights into the effects of physiology and lifestyle on lipid metabolism, genetic determinants of lipids, and the relationship between individual lipids and CHD risk factors.",

Controls were individuals without a self-reported history of cardiovascular disease (who had no ECG changes consistent with a previous MI) drawn from individuals concurrently identified in the same hospitals as index cases. Non-fasting blood samples were drawn from each participant, centrifuged within 45 min of venipuncture, frozen, and transported on dry ice to Cambridge, UK. Samples were stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until use. Details of the genotyping, imputation, and quality control (QC) have been described previously<strong>[1][2]</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Sample Selection and Batch Design:</strong></p><p>The samples were analyzed on 72 plates, each with a maximum of 80 samples per plate, according to a randomized block design that was developed using the <strong>\u201cblockTools\u201d package[3] </strong>in <strong>R v3.1.2</strong>. Sex, age, ethnicity, center, and time in years since date of survey were used as factors in the design, and the distance between blocks was minimized for all factors. A QC sample was created by pooling 100 \u03bcl of serum from 200 randomly selected samples, which was mixed and aliquoted for use on each plate. A subset of the QC sample was diluted with phosphate-buffered saline solution to 2 different concentrations, giving 3 different QC samples per plate (QC1 was undiluted, QC2 was 1:1 diluted, and QC3 was 1:3 diluted). For all samples, including QC samples, 15 \u03bcl was aliquoted into 1.2 ml-Cryovial tubes.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Saleheen D, Zaidi M, Rasheed A, Ahmad U, Hakeem A, Murtaza M, Kayani W et al.

An automated method for the extraction of lipids was developed using an Anachem Flexus automated liquid handler (Anachem, Milton Keynes, UK). 80 <strong>PROMIS</strong> samples, 4 blanks, and 12 QC samples in 1.2 ml-Cryovials were placed on the Flexus, 100 \u03bcl of Milli-Q H2O was added to each of the wells and mixed, and then 100 \u03bcl of the mixture was transferred to a glass coated 2.4 ml deep well plate (Plate+, Esslab, Hadleigh, UK). Next, 250 \u03bcl of MeOH was added containing 6 internal standards (0.6 \u03bcM 1,2-di-O-octadecyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, 1.2 \u03bcM 1,2-di-O-phytanyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine, 0.6 \u03bcM C8-ceramide, 0.6 \u03bcM N-heptadecanoyl-d-erythro-sphingosylphosporylcholine, 6.2 \u03bcM undecanoic acid, 0.6 \u03bcM trilaurin), followed by 500 \u03bcL of methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE). The plates were then sealed (using Corning aluminum microplate sealing tape [Sigma-Aldrich Company, UK]) and shaken for 10 min at 600 rpm (4 x g), after which the plate was transferred to a centrifuge and spun for 10 min at 6000 rpm (4000 x g). Each well in the resulting plate had 2 layers, with an aqueous layer at the bottom and an organic layer on top. A 96-head microdispenser (Hydra Matrix, Thermo Fisher Ltd., Hemel Hampstead, UK) was used to transfer 25 \u03bcl of the organic layer to a glass coated 240 \u03bcl low well plate (Plate+, Esslab, Hadleigh, UK), and 90 \u03bcl of MS-mix (7.5 mM NH4Ac IPA:MeOH [2:1]) was added using a Hydra Matrix, after which the plate was sealed and stored at \u221220 \u00b0C until analysis.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Han X, Gross RW.

Participants were excluded from analysis in a particular ionization mode if the total signal for the lipids in that mode was less than 5,000,000 (relative units), signifying poor infusion of the sample. Each lipid species was normalized by expressing the signal as a proportion of the total signal for each participant. Since the distributions of most of the lipid signals showed approximate log-normality, natural log-transformation was then applied to each normalized lipid signal. Lipid signals for individual participants were considered outliers and excluded if the normalized, log-transformed signal was more than 10 standard deviations (SD) from the mean for that lipid across all participants. Since the majority of <strong>PROMIS</strong> participants were not fasting at time of blood draw and their lipid levels could have spiked if they had recently consumed a high-fat meal, 10-SD was used as the cutoff to avoid being overly conservative. It is unlikely that lipids would have true values more than 10-SD from the mean, so any excluded measurements were either below the lower limit of detection or the measurement was false, perhaps due to a contaminant.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Chambers MC, Maclean B, Burke R, Amodei D, Ruderman DL, Neumann S et al.

Peaks were identified relative to a set of m/z values for known lipids downloaded from the <strong>LIPID MAPS database</strong>, and were retained if they were within a \u00b1 5 ppm window of the target m/z. Lipid subclasses searched in positive ionization mode were cholesterols (Chol), cholesteryl esters (CE), diacylglycerols (DG), triacylglycerols (TG), phosphatic acids (PA), lysophosphosphocholines (LysoPC), phosphatidylcholines (PC), phosphatidylethanolamines (PE), and sphingomyelins (SM). In negative ionization mode, lipid subclasses searched were ceramides (Cer), free fatty acids (FreeFA), PA, PC, PE, phosphatidylglycerols (PG), phosphatidylinositols (PI), phosphatidylserines (PS), and SM. Adducts considered were [M + H]+, [M+NH4]+, and [M + H - 2H2O]+ in positive ionization mode, and [M - H]- and [M + acetate]- in negative ionization mode. Isotope labeling was assessed visually and using the <strong>CAMERA package[2]</strong> within <strong>Bioconductor</strong> and <strong>R</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p>Following annotation in the pooled sample a list of m/z identity pairs, based on expected and possible lipids identified in human serum from the pool, was used to extract small windows of data around the target m/z in the average spectrum (see <strong>Fig 1c</strong> in the paper associated with the study). Note that while different adducts of a lipid are identified as separate entities, this approach focuses on the M ion rather than M + 1 and M + 2 ions, hence \u201cdeisotoping\u201d the data by excluding these peaks from the look-up table of identified lipid species. The peak maximum was measured and the 2 closest points to the half-height on either side were found, resulting in 4 points. The points with which a horizontal line at half-height intersected a line connecting the 2 points on either side of the peak (1 above the half-height and 1 below) was used for a peak-width calculation (distance of the line) and a more accurate m/z value for the peak maximum (midpoint of the line). For all m/z identity pairs, the maximum intensity was recorded as well as the deviation of the peaks\u2019 accurate m/z (see <strong>Fig 1d</strong> in the paper associated with the study). A major advantage of this approach is that it could be performed for each sample independently and run in parallel. The final step was the combination of all the signals (see <strong>Fig 1e</strong> in the paper associated with the study) and deviations (see <strong>Fig 1f</strong> in the paper associated with the study) into their respective files. The technical setup yielded average deviations of less than 4 ppm for the detected lipid species.</p><p><br></p><p>The peak-picking algorithm initially selected all lipids from a list containing 1305 lipids in positive ionization mode and 3772 lipids in negative ionization mode, corresponding to the expected major ions of all known lipids within the m/z range used and including all the previously identified lipid species from the pooled sample in what we refer to as a semi-targeted approach[3]. QC was performed to remove lipid signals that were not reliably detectable or did not show a linear response. Lipid signals were removed that were present in fewer than 80% of all QC samples or that had a poor correlation with concentration within the dilution range of QC samples (Pearson correlation r &lt; 0.95). The coefficient of variation (CV) for each lipid signal was then determined and all lipids with CVs of more than 25% were omitted.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Sud M, Fahy E, Cotter D, Brown A, Dennis EA, Glass CK, Merrill AH Jr, Murphy RC, Raetz CR, Russell DW, Subramaniam S.
