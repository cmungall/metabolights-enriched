                "description": "<p>The overuse of antibiotics has made public health and safety face a serious crisis. It is urgent to develop new clinical treatment methods to combat drug-resistant bacteria to alleviate the health crisis. The efficiency of antibiotics is closely related to the metabolic state of bacteria. However, studies on fluoroquinolone-resistant Salmonella are relatively rare. In this study, non-targeted metabolomics was used to analyze the metabolic difference between sarafloxacin-susceptible Salmonella Typhimurium (SAR-S) and sarafloxacin-resistant Salmonella Typhimurium (SAR-R), and found that the central carbon metabolism was weakened due to drug resistance. We also confirmed that exogenous L-leucine increased the killing effect of sarafloxacin on SAR-R and other clinically resistant Salmonella serotypes. Exogenous L-leucine stimulated the metabolic state of bacteria, especially the TCA cycle, which increased the working efficiency of the electron transfer chain and increased the intracellular NADH, ATP concentration and reactive oxygen species level. Furthermore, we used real-time quantitative PCR to confirm the changes in various metabolic characteristics. Our results suggest that when the metabolism of drug-resistant bacteria is reprogrammed, the bactericidal effect of antibiotics improves. This study further enhances research in the anti-drug resistance field at the metabolic level and provides theoretical support for solving the current problem of sarafloxacin drug resistance, a unique fluoroquinolone drug for animals. To sum up, our research results showed that exogenous L-leucine promotes the bactericidal effect of antibiotics through metabolic modification of drug-resistant bacteria, which has the potential as a new adjuvant of antibiotics.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>LC-MS negative mode</strong> is reported in the current study&nbsp;<a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS7713' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS7713</strong></a>.</p><p><strong>LC-MS positive mode</strong> is reported in&nbsp;<a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS7711' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS7711</strong></a>.</p>",

All metabolites identified (metabolites identified by combining positive and negative ions) were then classified and counted according to chemical taxonomy attribution information. The data were analyzed using principal component analysis (PCA), partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA), multivariate analysis, and the Student\u2019s t-test to study the intra- and inter-group differences between samples and to identify the different metabolites. The variable importance for the projection (VIP) obtained from the OPLS-DA model was used to measure the influence intensity and interpretation ability of each metabolite\u2019s expression pattern on the classification and discrimination of each sample group in order to mine the different metabolic molecules with biological significance. We used OPLS-DA VIP &gt; 1 and P value &lt; 0.05 as the screening criteria for significantly different metabolites for subsequent pathway analysis. The MetaboAnalyst (https://www.metaboanalyst.ca/MetaboAnalyst/) and Heatmapper (http://www.heatmapper.ca/) online tools were used for hierarchical clustering of differential metabolites.</p>",
