                "description": "<p>Macrophage-derived foam cell plays a pivotal role in the plaque formation and rupture during the progression of atherosclerosis. Foam cells are destined to divergent cell fate and functions in response to external stimuli based on their internal states, which however is hidden in the traditional studies based on population of cells. Herein, we used time-resolved and single-cell multi-omics to investigate the macrophage heterogeneity along foam cell formation. Dynamic metabolome and lipidome outlined the dual regulating axis of inflammation and ferroptosis. Single cell metabolomics and lipidomics further demonstrated a macrophage continuum featuring a differed susceptibility to apoptosis and ferroptosis. Using single-cell transcriptomic profiling, we verified the divergent cell fate toward apoptosis or ferroptosis. Therefore, the molecular choreography underlying the divergent cell fate during foam cell formation was revealed, which is of high significance for the understanding of the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and development of new drug targets.</p>",

For the lipid identification, we used the retention time of internal standards to predict the subclass-specific elution range and applied the equivalent carbon number model to predict the local elution window for certain lipid species. We filtered the annotated lipids with a threshold of RT error = 100 s.</p><p><br></p><p>For the single cell MS analysis, the tentative annotation was performed by searching the exact mass acquired against the library constructed by bulk metabolomic and lipidomic analysis. The mass error was set to 0.01 Da.</p>",
