                "description": "Metabolomics, understood as the science that manages the study of compounds from the metabolism, is an essential tool for deciphering metabolic changes in disease. The experiments rely on the use of high-throughput analytical techniques such as liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-ToF MS). This hyphenation has brought positive aspects such as higher sensitivity, specificity and the extension of the metabolome coverage in a single run. The analysis of a high number of samples in a single batch is currently not always feasible due to technical and practical issues (i.e., a drop of the MS signal) which result in the MS stopping during the experiment obtaining more than a single sample batch. In this situation, careful data treatment is required to enable an accurate joint analysis of multi-batch data sets. This paper summarizes the analytical strategies in large-scale metabolomic experiments; special attention has been given to QC preparation troubleshooting and data treatment. Moreover, labeled internal standards analysis and their aim in data treatment, and data normalization procedures (intra- and inter-batch) are described. These concepts are exemplified using a cohort of 165 patients from a study in asthma.",

For the analysis, 20 \u00b5l of a mix of 5 labelled internal standards (IS) were added to each sample. The IS mix was selected to cover a wide range of different retention times (RT) and physico-chemical properties. This was composed of: 1) Carnitine-D3 (C7H12D3NO3, mass=144.1454 Da, RT: 0.70 min, 0.02 mM); 2) Isoleucine-13C, 15N (13C6H1315NO2, molecular mass=138.1118 Da, RT: 0.77 min, 0.18 mM); 3) Sphingosine-D7 (C18H30D7NO2, molecular mass=306.3264 Da, RT: 14.38 min, 0.02 mM); 4) Lysophosphocholine 18:1-D7 (LPC 18:1-D7) (C26H45D7NO7P, molecular mass =528.3921 Da, 2 peaks at RTs= 19.30 and 20.00 min, 0.01 mM) and 5) Stearic acid-D5 (C18H31D5O2, molecular mass= 289.3029 Da, RT: 34.54 min, 0.17 mM). All detected adducts are present in Table S1 of the paper associated with this study. Samples were then vortex-mixed and kept on ice for 5 min. Supernatant was separated by centrifugation (16110 x g for 20 min at 4 \u00b0C) and transferred into LC vials for analysis. Extraction solvent used as blank for the analysis was prepared mixing 400 \u00b5l of cold (-20 \u00b0C) methanol:ethanol (1:1) and 20 \u00b5l of ISs. The blank followed the same steps as the samples.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>QC preparation:</strong></p><p>QC was prepared by pooling equal volumes of serum from the first 46 samples of the first batch. Then, the QC was aliquoted into different tubes to preserve it from freezing-thawing cycles. Every time QC was needed, fresh QC was prepared. The QCs clean-up steps followed the same procedure applied for the experimental samples. QCs were analyzed throughout the run to provide a measurement of system stability, performance and reproducibility of the LC-QToF-MS system.</p>",

The flow rate was set at 0.6 ml/min. The elution gradient involved a mobile phase consisting of: (A) 0.1% v/v formic acid (FA) in water and (B) 0.1% v/v FA in acetonitrile. The initial conditions were set at 25% phase B, which increased linearly to 95% phase B in 35 min. Then it returned to the initial conditions in 1 min, which were held for 9 min for column reconditioning.</p>",

Collected data from all batches were put and cleaned together in a single analysis of background and unrelated ions using MassHunter Profinder (B.08.00; SP3, Agilent Technologies) software. Molecular feature extraction (MFE) algorithm was used to reduce the size and complexity of data. Furthermore, Find by Ion (FbI) algorithm was applied to improve the reliability of the features found in the data. In the end, 1382 and 887 chemical signals for LC-MS positive and negative ionization modes were obtained respectively. Afterwards, raw data was filtered by keeping all features that were not present in the blanks, were detected in &gt;50% of all QCs and &gt;75% in the experimental samples. The rest of the signals were excluded from the analyses. Missing values were replaced using the kNN algorithm using an in-house script developed in Matlab[1].</p><p><br></p><p>The IS compounds were extracted in a targeted manner using a file containing the formula, mass and RT in MassHunter Profinder.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Data Normalization and Analysis:</strong></p><p>Different normalization strategies were used to pre-process the raw data matrix containing data acquired from the independent batches. For intra-batch normalization, the following methods were used: (1) Normalization of each signal (i.e., LC-MS feature) to the total area of the IS mix; (2) normalization of each signal by the TUS of each sample; (3) intra-batch effect correction using the QC-SVRC (10) algorithm using the information contained in the QCs to correct the drift of the MS signal within the batch. This algorithm requires the selection of the tolerance threshold (\u03b5), the kernel width (\u03b3) and the error penalty parameter (C). The values used were \u03b5 = 5%, \u03b3 = [2^\u22123, 2^\u22122, \u2026, 2^6], and C = 50%. In addition to intra-batch normalization using QC-SVRC, a sequential inter-batch effect correction called QC-norm was tested. It is a ratio-based method which normalizes the intensity of each signal in each sample using as scaling factor the ratio of the median intensity in the QC of the corresponding batch over the median QC intensity across batches (4). Moreover, after each normalization, features were filtered by keeping those with a RSD &lt; 30% in QCs.</p><p><br></p><p>To monitor the performance of each data pre-processing strategy, the abundance of TUS as a function of the injection order was depicted before and after each normalization approach. In each of them, the mean plus/minus 2 and 3 times the SD were calculated and depicted for each batch independently.</p><p><br></p><p>Multivariate and HCA were performed using SIMCA v.15.0 (Umetrics, Ume\u00e5, Sweden). PCA, a non-supervised model, was used to identify patterns across samples associated to the injection order and batch after the data normalization. Autoscaling was used for all the models. HCA was performed for the samples analyzed in all batches to assess the similarity after normalization using Ward\u2019s method to calculate the similarity between clusters. The trees were sorted by size.</p><p><br></p><p>Ref:</p><p>[1] Gromski PS, Xu Y, Kotze HL, Correa E, Ellis DI, Armitage EG, Turner ML, Goodacre R.
