Here, we investigated the serum metabolomic profile of a well-characterized cohort of elderly subjects encompassing the whole fit-to-frail continuum. Enrichment analyses revealed a complex dysregulation of amino acids and energy metabolism in both pre-frail and frail participants. Remarkably, upregulated betaine levels emerged as a specific biochemical signature of pre-frailty, holding promise for the development of novel targeted interventions.</p>",

The patients were included if (1) admitted for functional loss secondary to a non-disabling disease; (2) aged 65 years or older. The following exclusion criteria were applied: 1) any disease that could directly affect muscle strength (including neurological diseases, hip fractures or amputations); 2) dementia according to DSM-5 criteria 31 ; 3) any systemic condition potentially affecting serum amino acid levels, including kidney, liver, rheumatologic and neoplastic diseases, history of drug or alcohol abuse; (4) history of altered serum creatinine levels (&amp;gt; 1.2 mg/dl) or liver function parameters (aspartate transaminase or alanine transaminase &amp;gt; 50 U/l). Smoking status (current/former/never smoker) was assessed trough interview. The total number of drugs habitually taken by subjects was retrieved from medical records. This study was approved by the local ethics committee (protocol 20180097520, 09/11/2018) and was in conformity with the Helsinki Declaration.
