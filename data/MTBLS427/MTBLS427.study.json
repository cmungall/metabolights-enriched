                "description": "Characterization of endogenous metabolites and xenobiotics is essential to deconvoluting the genetic and environmental causes of disease. However, surveillance of chemical exposure and disease-related changes in large cohorts requires an analytical platform that offers rapid measurement, high sensitivity, efficient separation, broad dynamic range, and application to an expansive chemical space. Here, we present a novel platform for small molecule analyses that addresses these requirements by combining solidphase extraction with ion mobility spectrometry and mass spectrometry (SPE-IMS-MS). This platform is capable of performing both targeted and global measurements of endogenous metabolites and xenobiotics in human biofluids with high reproducibility (CV <= 3%), sensitivity (LODs in the pM range in biofluids) and throughput (10-s sample-to-sample duty cycle). We report application of this platform to the analysis of human urine from patients with and without type 1 diabetes, where we observed statistically significant variations in the concentration of disaccharides and previously unreported chemical isomers. This SPE-IMS-MS platform overcomes many of the current challenges of large-scale metabolomic and exposomic analyses and offers a viable option for population and patient cohort screening in an effort to gain insights into disease processes and human environmental chemical exposure.",

The Childhood and Adolescent Diabetes program at the CNMC is the largest center in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States, caring for approximately 1600 juvenile patients with T1D. A comprehensive human subject protocol was developed to ensure patient confidentiality, including all clinical and molecular meta-data collected during recruitment, and that the procedures for specimen collection were not associated with direct health risks. A human subject consent form was designed with sufficient information for the to-be-enrolled sibling pairs and their parents/guardians (for subjects less than 18 yrs of age) to allow them an assessment of the public benefits of the research and the confidentiality loss or health risks. The consent form and protocol were approved by the Internal Review Boards at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) and CNMC. PNNL staff had access to patient identifier codes but not the names or addresses of the study participants. The urine specimens were stored up to 4 weeks at -20 \u00baC at the CNMC clinical site and transferred to the PNNL for storage at -80 \u00baC until further use.",

                        "description": "A RapidFire 365 Solid Phase Extraction (SPE) (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) was interfaced to an Agilent 6560 Ion Mobility QTOF MS system[1][2] (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). The RapidFire 365 uses high-speed robotics and fast-switching valves to facilitate ultra-fast online SPE. A 10 \u00b5l sample loop was used for all experiments. A C18 SPE cartridge (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) was selected for the initial experiments. The system was optimized to maximize the binding efficiency, while minimizing carry-over, using the xenobiotic standard mixture. To overload the sample loop, 30 \u00b5l of each urine sample was loaded onto the SPE cartridge using a combination of 0.1% formic acid and 99.9% water (v/v) (mobile phase A, flow rate at1.5 ml/min), and eluted using a combination of 0.1% formic acid, 49.95% isopropanol (IPA) and 49.95% methanol (v/v/v) (mobile phase B, flow rate at 0.6 ml/min). Based on C18 SPE cartridge optimization of the small molecule polar extracts from urine, mixed mode, graphitic carbon, and HILIC cartridges were used to maximize detection coverage of small molecules with differing affinities. The same mobile phase A and B were applied to the mixed mode cartridge as described for the C18 cartridge. For the graphitic carbon cartridge, the polar urine extracts were loaded using the same mobile phase A as used for C18 cartridge, but the small molecules were eluted using a combination of 0.1% formic acid, 25% acetonitrile, 25% acetone and 49.9% water (v/v/v/v) (mobile phase B, flow rate at 0.6 ml/min). For the HILIC cartridge, the polar urine extracts were loaded using a combination of 0.1% formic acid, 10% IPA, 89.9% hexane (v/v/v) (mobile phase A, flow rate at 1.5 ml/min), and small molecules were eluted using the same mobile phase B as used for the C18 cartridge. Aspiration time, load time, elution time and re-equilibration time were 0.6 s, 3 s, 6 s, and 1 ms, respectively, for a total cycle time of ~10 s. The sample injection sipper and valve loops were washed with water followed by acetonitrile between each sample injection.\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] May JC, Goodwin CR, Lareau NM, Leaptrot KL, Morris CB, Kurulugama RT, Mordehai A, Klein C, Barry W, Darland E, Overney G, Imatani K, Stafford GC, Fjeldsted JC, McLean JA.

A jet stream orthogonal electrospray ionization source was utilized to connect the RapidFire with the IMS-QTOF MS. Ions generated by ESI were transmitted through the glass capillary, high-pressure ion funnel and the ion funnel trap (IFT). The IFT pulsed ions into the IMS drift tube (78 cm) filled with nitrogen, where a uniform electric field (16.5 V/cm) was applied and pressure was maintained at 3.95 Torr. Ions were separated in the drift tube and refocused by a rear ion funnel before entering the Q-TOF MS. Additional instrumentation details can be found elsewhere[1][2].\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] May JC, Goodwin CR, Lareau NM, Leaptrot KL, Morris CB, Kurulugama RT, Mordehai A, Klein C, Barry W, Darland E, Overney G, Imatani K, Stafford GC, Fjeldsted JC, McLean JA.
