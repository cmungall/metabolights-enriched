                "description": "<p>The vasculature represents a highly plastic compartment, capable of switching from a quiescent to an active proliferative state during angiogenesis. Metabolic reprogramming in endothelial cells (ECs) thereby is crucial to cover the increasing cellular energy demand under growth conditions. Here we assess the impact of mitochondrial bioenergetics on neovascularisation, by deleting cox10 gene encoding an assembly factor of cytochrome c oxidase (COX) specifically in mouse ECs, providing a model for vasculature-restricted respiratory deficiency. We show that EC-specific cox10 ablation results in deficient vascular development causing embryonic lethality. In adult mice induction of EC-specific cox10 gene deletion produces no overt phenotype. However, the angiogenic capacity of COX-deficient ECs is severely compromised under energetically demanding conditions, as revealed by significantly delayed wound-healing and impaired tumour growth. We provide genetic evidence for a requirement of mitochondrial respiration in vascular endothelial cells for neoangiogenesis during development, tissue repair and cancer. </p>",

                        "description": "<p>To characterise the metabolic changes of isolated ECs, 2 x 10^4 cells per well were seeded on gelatine-coated Seahorse 96-well plates 36 h before measurement in a 1:1 mixture of EGM2 (PromoCell) and full supplemented DMEM and analysed according to Agilent protocols (MitoStress, GlycoStress Kit) with a Seahorse XF96 analyser. Parameters of metabolic function depicted as bar charts in the figures were calculated according to Agilent protocols. Basal respiration: (Last rate measurement before oligomycin injection)-((minimum rate measurement after rotenone/antimycin A injection)=non-mitochondrial oxygen consumption); Proton leak: (Minimum rate measurement after oligomycin injection)-(non-mitochondrial respiration); ATP production: (Last rate measurement before oligomycin injection)-minimum rate measurement after oligomycin injection); spare respiratory capacity: ((Maximum rate measurement after FCCP injection\u2013(non-mitochondrial respiration)=maximal respiration))-(basal respiration); Glycolysis: (Maximum rate measurement before oligomycin injection- Last rate measurement before glucose injection); glycolytic reserve: ((Maximum rate measurement after oligomycin injection)- Last rate measurement before glucose injection)=glycolytic capacity)-glycolysis. ECAR and OCR drop was calculated as the difference in the respective parameter before and after addition of glucose in the glycolysis stress assay. To measure oxygen consumption rate with or without lactate the MitoStress assay was conducted using a modified assay medium without pyruvate and without glucose. Values were normalised to protein concentrations per well determined by Pierce BCA Protein Assay according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and expressed as per \u00b5g protein (Figure 2 of associated publication). All seahorse experiments were performed in the respective Agilent assay medium (assay duration according to manufacturer\u2019s protocol up to 90 min with preincubation in a non-CO2 incubator in non-buffered medium for 1 h) .</p>",
