                "description": "<p>Metabolic networks are interconnected and influence diverse cellular processes. The protein-metabolite interactions that mediate these networks are frequently low affinity and challenging to systematically discover. We developed mass spectrometry integrated with equilibrium dialysis for the discovery of allostery systematically (MIDAS) to identify such interactions. Analysis of 33 enzymes from human carbohydrate metabolism identified 830 protein-metabolite interactions, including known regulators, substrates and products as well as previously unreported interactions. We functionally validated a subset of interactions, including the isoform-specific inhibition of lactate dehydrogenase by long-chain acyl-coenzyme A. Cell treatment with fatty acids caused a loss of pyruvate-lactate interconversion dependent on lactate dehydrogenase isoform expression. These protein-metabolite interactions may contribute to the dynamic, tissue-specific metabolic flexibility that enables growth and survival in an ever-changing nutrient environment.</p>",

All metabolites used in this study were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Cayman Chemicals, Avanti Polar Lipids, Enamine, Combi-Blocks, Inc, or custom sourced using Aldrich Market Select (Data S1). Metabolites were solvated to 10 mM in molecular grade water (Sigma-Aldrich W4502) or DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich D1435) and, where necessary to increase solubility, titrated with acid or base. The MIDAS metabolite library was arrayed 1 mL per well in 96-deep well storage plates (Greiner 780280), sealed with aluminum foil seals (VWR 60941-112), and stored at -80 \u00b0C. When working stocks were needed, metabolites were moved from the deep well storage plates and arrayed, 50 \u00b5L per well, across multiple, single-use 384-well small volume plates storage plates (Greiner 781280), sealed with aluminum foil seals (VWR 60941-112), and stored at -80 \u00b0C. Metabolite library management and manipulation was conducted on a Beckman Coulter Biomek NXp SPAN-8 liquid handling robot.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>All presented proteins analyzed by MIDAS were prepared and provided by collaborators using common protein expression and purification techniques (Data S3). Proteins were received snap frozen on dry ice from outside sources or on wet ice from local sources and screened immediately upon defrost. Prior to MIDAS screening, protein quality was assessed by 12.5% SDS-PAGE and concentration was determined by A280 on a NanoDrop One UV-Vis spectrophotometer using the molecular weight and calculated extinction coefficient (M-1 . cm-1) of each protein construct. Proteins were screened by MIDAS at the concentrations indicated in Data S3. Protein expression plasmids generated in this study are available on Addgene.</p>",

The MIDAS screening pools were prepared in LC-MS grade 150 mM ammonium acetate pH 7.4 (Sigma-Aldrich 73594) and pH-adjusted with ammonium hydroxide (Sigma-Aldrich 338818). The majority of metabolites were prepared to a final screening concentration of 50 \u00b5M in the metabolites pools, with a subset at higher or lower concentration dependent on their FIA-MS ionization properties (Data S1). For each metabolite pool, 8 \u00b5L of target protein (Data S3) was arrayed in a minimum of a triplicate across a 10 kDa MWCO 96-well microdialysis plate (SWISSCI Diaplate) and sealed with aluminum foil seals (Beckman Coulter 538619) to create the protein chambers. To the reverse side, 300 \u00b5L of metabolite pool was aliquoted per target protein replicate and sealed with aluminum foil seals (Beckman Coulter 538619) to create the metabolite chambers. Where necessary and just prior to screening, proteins provided in alternative buffer systems were in situ, sequentially exchanged into 150 mM ammonium acetate pH 7.4 (Sigma-Aldrich 73594) on the 96-well microdialysis screening plate (SWISSCI Diaplate). Loaded dialysis plates were placed in the dark at 4 \u00b0C on a rotating shaker (120 rpm) and incubated for 40 h. Post-dialysis, protein- and metabolite-chamber dialysates were retrieved, sample volume normalized and diluted 1:10 in 80% methanol (Sigma-Aldrich 1060351000) to denature protein, incubated 30 min on ice, and centrifuged at 3200 x g for 15 min to remove denatured protein. Processed protein- and metabolite-chamber dialysates were retrieved and arrayed across a 384-well microvolume plate (Thermo Scientific AB-1056), sealed with a silicon slit septum cap mat (Thermo Scientific AB-1171) and placed at 4 \u00b0C for FIA-MS analysis.</p>",

Briefly, 2 \u03bcL of each processed protein- and metabolite-chamber dialysate (~10 pmoles per metabolite, depending on metabolite) was injected in technical triplicate with blanks injections interspersed between technical triplicates. Mobile phase flow rate was 0.2 mL/min. The following mobile phases were used according to the MIDAS metabolite pool being analyzed: pool 1, 5 mM ammonium acetate pH 5 (Sigma-Aldrich 73594), 50% methanol (Honeywell LC230-4); pools 2 and 4, 5 mM ammonium acetate pH 6.8 (Sigma-Aldrich 73594), 50% methanol (Honeywell LC230-4); pool 3, 10 mM formic acid pH 3 (Sigma-Aldrich F0507), 50% methanol (Honeywell LC230-4). Pools 1 and 2 were analyzed in positive mode and pools 3 and 4 were analyzed in negative mode. Source conditions consisted of 40 psi ion source gas 1 and 2, 30 psi curtain gas, 600 \u00b0C source temperature, and +5500 V or -4500 V spray voltage. Method duration was 1 min. All target proteins for a given metabolite pool and MS method were analyzed together before switching FIA-MS methods. Between FIA-MS methods, the Shimadzu Nexera HPLC system and SCIEX X500R ESI-QTOF MS where equilibrated for 40 min to the next FIA-MS method. Auto-calibration of positive or negative mode was performed approximately every 45 min at the beginning of a protein-metabolite pool batch to control instrument detector.

                        "description": "<p>All FIA-MS scans generating MIDAS data from this study were converted from the compressed, proprietary SCIEX format to mzML using ProteoWizard msConvert<strong>[1][2]</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p>MIDAS FIA-MS spectra were processed in SCIEX OS 1.6 software using a targeted method to determine metabolite abundances in the protein- and metabolite-chambers. Briefly, raw MS spectra were quantitatively processed in SCIEX OS Analytics 1.6 using the MQ4 peak integration algorithm to quantify metabolite abundance. Metabolite extracted ion chromatograms (XICs) were identified by the intact mass determined from the chemical formula, adduct/charge and precursor mass as indicated in Data S2 with 0.01 Da XIC width, 0.16 min retention time, 2-point Gaussian smooth width, 1000 point peak splitting and 1 min baseline subtraction window. Metabolite abundance was quantified as the integrated area under the XIC counts per s peak trace. Following metabolite quantification, the mean of technical triplicate injections was used to generate a metabolite abundance for each protein- and metabolite-chamber per dialysis replicate. If necessary, up to one dialysis replicate per pool per protein was removed if processing or autosampling technical abnormalities were identified. For each dialysis replicate, log2(fold change) for each metabolite was calculated as the difference between the log2 abundance in the protein- and metabolite-chambers. Log2(fold change) for non-separable metabolite isomers (e.g., L-Leu/L-Ile/L-Allo-Ile, F1,6BP/G1,6BP, etc.) within the same screening pool were collapsed to a single entry prior to further data processing leading to 333 unique metabolite analytes (isomer entries delimited by '/'). Using the replicate protein-metabolite log2(fold change) values as input, a processing method was developed in R (https://github.com/KevinGHicks/MIDAS) to filter extreme outliers, correct for non-specific systematic variation and to identify significant protein-metabolite interactions. Briefly, for each dialysis triplicate set, the mean and standard deviation were used to generate z-scores, and up to one outlier was removed using a z-score cutoff of 5 (&lt;0.2% of observations). Dialysis replicates were then averaged yielding one mean fold change summary per protein-metabolite pair. To remove fold change variation that was not specific to a given protein-metabolite pair, the first 3 principal components of the total screening dataset were removed on a per metabolite pool basis by subtracting the projection of the first 3 principal components, creating log2(corrected fold change). This approach is similar to commonly used methodologies such as surrogate variable analysis<strong>[3][4]</strong> that correct for latent variables explaining a large amount of variance in a dataset which is not captured by experimental covariates. PMIs were identified as extreme fold changes relative to each metabolite\u2019s variation across all 158 unique proteins analyzed (36 proteins presented in this study, in addition to 122 anonymized proteins). Across proteins, a metabolite\u2019s fold change distribution is a mixture of non-PMIs (which are approximately normally-distributed) and genuine PMIs, which tend to have extreme fold changes. Ideally, we would want to compare each putative PMI to a background distribution of non-PMIs but since these classes are unknown we can instead assume that no metabolite interacts with most proteins and estimate summaries of the overall fold change distribution which should approximate the non-PMI\u2019s 'no-signal' variability. To do this we calculate a z-score by comparing each protein-metabolite log2(corrected fold change) to a a no-signal model for that metabolite using measures of the central tendency (median) and standard deviation (extrapolated from the inter quartile range (IQR); i.e., SD = IQR/1.35 based on the standard properties of the Normal distribution), which are robust to the signals in the tails of a metabolite\u2019s fold change distribution. When signals do exist, the IQR method will overestimate the standard deviation, hence the method is statistically conservative. Protein-metabolite interaction z-scores were compared to the quantiles of the standard Normal distribution to generate p-values and were false-discovery rate controlled using Storey\u2019s q-value<strong>[5]</strong>. Protein-metabolite interactions with q-values &lt; 0.01 were considered significant for subsequent analyses. The complete MIDAS protein-metabolite interaction dataset for mTORC1 regulators and enzymes of carbohydrate metabolism can be found in Data S4.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Adusumilli R, Mallick P.
