                "description": "<p>In recent years, with the deepening of research on intestinal microbiota, we found intestinal microbiota plays an important role in host immune regulation and barrier maintenance through cross-talk between the microbiota and the host. New evidence suggests that disruption of the fragile balance within the intestinal microbiota, termed as dysbiosis, may cause tremendous inflammation in both intestine proximal and distant organ. Our previous studies have shown that Bacterial infections of the liver and lungs are accompanied by changes in intestinal flora diversity, and the depletion of intestinal bacteria can aggravate bacterial infection. Though, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from a healthy population has already been associated with the reduction of urinary tract infections which caused by C. difficile. However, the mechanisms by which the intestinal microbiota affects the immune responses in bacterial cystitis (BC) remain poorly characterized.</p>",
