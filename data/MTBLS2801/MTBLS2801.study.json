                "description": "<p>Extracellular vesicles (EVs) constitute an intricate system of molecular exchange that has recently gained tremendous interest. However, sustainable sources of safe biological EVs remain scarce and elusive. In this study we explore and define the use of food industry byproducts (BP) as a circular source of safe biocompatible EVs. Averaged diameter and molecular compositions indicate large yield of exosomes and high abundancy of membrane lipids with signaling capacity in these vesicles. Complex proteomes mimicking those circulating in human blood plasma were also identified. Furthermore, BP-EVs did not show relevant cytotoxicity and displayed excellent oral and intravenous bioavailability together with specific organ targeting capacity. Collectively, we believe that the novel findings reported here will open substantial venues for the use of BP as an optimal source of biocompatible nanovesicles in manifold applications of the bioeconomy and biomedical fields.</p>",

Samples were vigorously shaken by vortexing for 2 min and then 250 \u03bcL of methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) were added. Samples were immersed in a water bath (ATU Ultrasonidos, Valencia, Spain) with an ultrasound frequency and power of 40 KHz and 100 W, respectively, at 10 \u00b0C for 30 min. Then, 25 \u03bcL of milliQ water were added to the mixture, and organic phase was separated by centrifugation (1400 x g) at 10 \u00b0C for 10 min<strong>[1]</strong>. BP-EVs-derived lipid extracts, contained in the upper phase, were collected and subjected to mass spectrometry (MS). Internal isotopically labelled lipid standards for each class were used for signal normalization<strong>[2]</strong>. Stock solutions were prepared by dissolving lipid standards in MTBE at a concentration of 1 mg/mL, and working solutions were diluted to 2.5 \u03bcg/mL in MTBE.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Pizarro C, Arenzana-R\u00e1mila I, P\u00e9rez-del-Notario N, P\u00e9rez-Matute P, Gonz\u00e1lez-S\u00e1iz JM.

Multivariate statistics Partial Least-squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) were performed using <strong>Metaboanalyst</strong> software. Features representing significant differences by univariate statistics ANOVA (p &lt; 0.05), defined by exact mass and retention time, were reported. An initial tentative classification into lipid families of molecular features present consistently in 3 replicates was performed using <strong>CEU Mass Mediator</strong> v.3.0 (accuracy &lt; 10 ppm). Identities of interest were also searched against <strong>HMDB</strong> (accuracy &lt; 30 ppm)&nbsp;and <strong>LIPID MAPS</strong> (accuracy &lt; 20 ppm) databases. The identities obtained were compared to retention time of the authentic standards added. Finally, identities were confirmed by MS/MS by checking the MS/MS spectrums using <strong>LipidBlast</strong> software and <strong>LipidMatch</strong>, a <strong>R</strong>-based tool for lipid identification .</p>",
