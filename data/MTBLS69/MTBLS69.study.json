                "description": "In colorectal cancer, p53 is commonly inactivated, associated with chemo-resistance, and marks the transition from non-invasive to invasive disease. Cancers, including colorectal cancer, are thought to be diseases of aberrant stem cell populations, as stem cells are able to self-renew, making them long-lived enough to acquire mutations necessary to manifest the disease. We have shown that extracts from sweet sorghum stalk components eliminate colon cancer stem cells (CCSC) in a partial p53-dependent fashion. However, the underlying mechanisms are unknown. In the present study, CCSC were transfected with short hairpin-RNA against p53 (CCSC p53 shRNA) and treated with sweet sorghum phenolics extracted from different plant components (dermal layer, leaf, seed head and whole plant). While all components demonstrated anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects in CCSC, phenolics extracted from the dermal layer and seed head were more potent in eliminating CCSC by elevating caspases 3/7 activity, PARP cleavage, and DNA fragmentation in a p53-dependent and p53-independent fashion, respectively. Further investigations revealed that the anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects were associated with decreases in beta-catenin protein levels, and beta-catenin targets cyclin D1, cMyc, and survivin. These results suggest that the anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of sweet sorghum extracts against human colon cancer stem cells are via suppression of Wnt/beta-catenin pro-survival signaling in a p53-dependent (dermal layer) and partial p53-independent (seed head) fashion.

Acetone (80%) was identified in the literature and empirically as a superior extraction solvent for sweet sorghum dermal and pith layers. Ethanol (80%) was used as a GRAS alternative. Fresh sweet sorghum sample (2 g) was extracted with 20 ml of extraction solvent chilled to \u221220 \u00b0C. This was to prevent excessive heating during the homogenization of the sample. This mixture was then homogenized for 2 min using an IKA T25 digital ultra TURRAX at 10 000 rpm. The tubes were then vortexed, and the resulting mixture was then centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant was filtered using a 0.45 \u03bcm PTFE syringe filter (Tisch Scientific, North Bend, OH). The resulting pellet was then resuspended in 20 ml of extraction solvent by vortexing for 1 min and centrifuged, and the supernatant was collected and filtered. This was repeated for a third round of extraction, after which the filtrates were combined and the final volume was brought to 100 ml. The phenolic extracts were then stored at \u221220 \u00b0C until analysis for total phenolics and antioxidant activity and by LC\u2212MS.",
