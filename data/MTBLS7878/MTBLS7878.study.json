                "description": "<h4><strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong> Sepsis is intricately linked to intestinal damage and barrier dysfunction. At present times, there is a growing interest in a metabolite-based therapy for multiple diseases.</h4><p><strong>METHODS:</strong> Serum samples from septic patients and healthy individuals were collected and their metabonomics profiling assessed using Ultra-Performance Liquid Chromatography-Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry (UPLC-TOFMS). The eXtreme Gradient Boosting algorithms (XGBOOST) method was used to screen essential metabolites associated with sepsis, and five machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, XGBoost, GaussianNB(GNB), upport vector machines(SVM) and RandomForest were constructed to distinguish sepsis including a training set (75%) and validation set(25%). The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and Brier scores were used to compare the prediction performances of different models. Pearson analysis was used to analysis the relationship between the metabolites and the severity of sepsis. Both cellular and animal models were used to HYPERLINK 'javascript:;' assess the function of the metabolites.</p><p><strong>RESULTS:</strong> The occurrence of sepsis involve metabolite dysregulation. The metabolites mannose-6-phosphate and sphinganine as the optimal sepsis-related variables screened by XGBOOST algorithm. The XGBoost model (AUROC=0.956) has the most stable performance to establish diagnostic model among the five machine learning methods. The SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) package was used to interpret the XGBOOST model. Pearson analysis reinforced the expression of Sphinganine, Mannose 6-phosphate were positively associated with the APACHE-II, PCT, WBC, CRP and IL-6. We also demonstrated that sphinganine strongly diminished the LDH content in LPS-treated Caco-2 cells. In addition, using both <em>in vitro</em> and <em>in vivo</em> examination, we revealed that sphinganine strongly protects against sepsis-induced intestinal barrier injury.</p><p><strong>DISCUSSION:</strong> These findings highlighted the potential diagnostic value of the ML, and also provided new insight into enhanced therapy and/or preventative measures against sepsis.</p>",

The metabolites were identified by accuracy mass (&lt;\u200930 ppm) and MS/MS data which were matched with HMDB (http://www.hmdb.ca), MassBank (http://www.massbank.jp/), LIPIDMAPS (http://www.lipidmaps.org), mzCloud (https://www.mzcloud.org) and KEGG (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/). The robust LOESS signal correction (QC-RLSC) was applied for data normalization to correct for any systematic bias. After normalization, only ion peaks with relative standard deviations (RSDs) &lt; 30% in QC were kept to ensure proper metabolite identification.</p><p><br></p><p>The Ropls software was used for all multivariate data analyses and modelings. Data were mean-centered using scaling. Models were built on principal component analysis (PCA), orthogonal partial least-square discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) and partial least-square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). The metabolic profiles could be visualized as score plot where each point represents a sample. The corresponding loading plot and S-plot were generated to provide information on the metabolites that influence clustering of the samples. All the models evaluated were tested for over fitting with methods of permutation tests. The descriptive performance of the models was determined by R2X cumulative (perfect model: R2X (cum)\u2009=\u20091) and R2Y cumulative (perfect model: R2Y (cum)\u2009=\u20091) values while their prediction performance was measured by Q2 cumulative (perfect model: Q2 (cum)\u2009=\u20091) and a permutation test. The permuted model should not be able to predict classes: R2 and Q2 values at the Y-axis intercept must be lower than those of Q2 and the R2 of the non-permuted model. OPLS-DA allowed the determination of discriminating metabolites using the variable importance on projection (VIP). The p-value, Variable importance projection (VIP) produced by OPLS-DA, fold change (FC) was applied to discover the contributable-variable for classification. Finally, p-value \uff1c 0.05 and VIP values \uff1e 1 were considered to be statistically significant metabolites.</p><p><br></p><p>Differential metabolites were subjected to pathway analysis by MetaboAnalyst, which combines results from powerful pathway enrichment analysis with the pathway topology analysis. The identified metabolites in metabolomics were then mapped to the KEGG pathway for biological interpretation of higher-level systemic functions.
