                "description": "<p><strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong> Currently, the anti-oxidation of active ingredients in mulberry leaves (MLs) and their forage utilization is receiving increasing attention. Here, we propose that MLs supplementation improves oxidative resistance and immunity. </p><p><strong>METHODS:</strong> We conducted a trial including 3 groups of growing mutton sheep, each receiving fermented mulberry leaves (FMLs) feeding, dried mulberry leaves (DMLs) feeding or normal control feeding without MLs. </p><p><strong>RESULTS:</strong> Transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses revealed that promoting anti-oxidation and enhancing disease resistance of MLs is attributed to improved tryptophan metabolic pathways and reduced peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Furthermore, immunity was markedly increased after FMLs treatment by regulating glycolysis and mannose-6-phosphate pathways. Additionally, there was better average daily gain in the MLs treatment groups. </p><p><strong>CONCLUSION:</strong> These findings provide new insights for understanding the beneficial effects of MLs in animal husbandry and provide a theoretical support for extensive application of MLs in improving nutrition and health care values.</p>",

One half is sun-dried for 7 days, next well-sealed in woven bags after a little rubbing and then stored in a dry, dark place for acquiring DMLs for use in feeding experiment. The other half with 65.03% moisture content after wilted by sun-shine for a half day, is a little smashed and vacuum sealed in fermentationspecial bags to ferment with 5% Lactobacillus plantarum inoculation at room temperature (27.5-28.0 \u00b0C) for 30 days in Q10 a dry, dark place for preparation for FMLs. Here 5% is adding 5 mL of bacterial culture suspension to 100 g of MLs and the concentration of bacterial culture suspension is 1 x 10^8 CFU/mL. Lactobacillus plantarum (CICC 23941) purchased from the China Center of Industrial Culture Collection (www.chinacicc.org). Before feeding experiments, the pH, crude protein, crude fiber as well as gross energy of FMLs and DMLs are determined according to standard methods of AOAC. And their contents are shown in <strong>Table 1</strong> in the paper<strong> </strong>associated<strong> </strong>with this study. FMLs are deemed qualified without aflatoxin B1 detected at a minimum checked value of 0.1 mg/kg by Huayan Testing Group Co., Ltd in Xi\u2019an City, Shaanxi Province (Detection number: SP202115450).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Experimental design and feeding diets</strong></p><p>Animal experiments are conducted on 6-month-old healthy female mutton sheep (white-headed Suffolk sheep x Hu sheep) weighing 30.41 kg at average without genetic modification in Gansu Qinghuan Meat Sheep Seed Production Co. Ltd (Huan County, Qingyang City, Gansu Province, China). The animals were randomly assigned to group Con feeding a normal control diet (n=18), group TR1 feeding an experimental diet with FMLs (n=18) and group TR2 feeding an experimental diet with DMLs (n=18) and then treated for an experiment of 50 days. Each group had 6 replicates with 3 sheep per replicate. Before the feeding experiment, animals undergo an acclimatization period of 6 days to obtain an appropriate feed intake, during which they were allowed unlimited access to their corresponding experimental diet and tap water. Experimental sheep were housed in sheepfold and given self-help feeding in 3 groups every day. The ingredients and chemical composition of 3 experimental diets are shown in <strong>Table 2</strong> in the paper associated with this study. The chemical compositions of 3 experimental diets are determined by Ulanqab Yima Agriculture and Animal Husbandry Technology Co., Ltd (Ulanqab City, Inner Mongolia, China).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Weighing and sample collection</strong></p><p>Prior to the experiments, all sheep are driven to be weighed by an automatic weighing system to obtain the initial body weights. Afterwards, body weights on day 25th and 50th are weighted to calculate daily gains. On the 50th day, blood from the jugular vein was collected and placed in 5 mL vacuum negative-pressure tubes with yellow cap containing separation gels for serum separation and then leave to set for 1-2 h to collect rough 2.5 mL serum, which is immediately stored in liquid nitrogen and taken to the lab for further analysis. At the end of the experimental period, 6 sheep per group which were representative in terms of average weight (inclusion criteria) of group were selected and slaughtered for tissue sample collection. Tissue samples (about 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm^3) of longissimus dorsi muscle and subcutaneous fat from the left side of the carcass are packed into 2 mL cryopreserved tube and frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately within 20 min of slaughter for biochemical indexes and omics analysis. Weighting samples contain 18 biological repeats of each group.</p>",
