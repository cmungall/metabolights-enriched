                "description": "<p>Bacterial growth substrates influence a variety of biological functions, including the biosynthesis and regulation of lipid intermediates. The extent of this rewiring is not well understood nor has it been considered in the context of virally-infected cells. Here, we use a one-host-two-temperate phage model system to probe the combined influence of growth substrate and phage infection on host carbon and lipid metabolism. Using untargeted metabolomics and lipidomics, we report the detection of a suite of metabolites and lipid classes for two Sulfitobacter lysogens provided with three growth substrates of differing complexity and nutrient composition (yeast extract/tryptone [complex], glutamate and acetate). Growth medium led to dramatic differences in the detectable intracellular metabolites, with only 15% of 175 measured metabolites showing overlap across the three growth substrates. Between-strain differences were most evident in the cultures grown on acetate, followed by glutamate then complex medium. Lipid distribution profiles were also distinct between cultures grown on different substrates as well as between the two lysogens grown in the same medium. Five phospholipid, three aminolipid and one class of unknown lipid-like features were identified. Most (\u2265 94%) of these 75 lipids were quantifiable in all samples. Metabolite and lipid profiles were strongly determined by growth medium composition and modestly by strain type. As fluctuations in availability and form of carbon substrates and nutrients, as well as virus pressure, are common features of natural systems, the influence of these intersecting factors will undoubtedly be imprinted in the metabolome and lipidome of resident bacteria.</p>",

Strains were grown in Standard Marine Media (SMM, hereafter referred to as complex) [4.1 M NaCl; 950 mM KCl; 700 mM CaCl2; 20 mM H3BO3; 2.1 mM MgSO4 (7H2O); 2.0 M MgCl2; 1.0 M Tris (Tris-HCl and Tris-Base; pH 7.5); 800 mM NaHCO3; 5.0 M NH4Cl; 150 mM K2HPO4. 1.125 g yeast extract, 2 g tryptone, Fe, vitamins and minerals<strong>[1]</strong>] or Roseobacter Marine Media (RMM) [4 M NaCl; 0.2 M KCl; 0.2MCaCl2; 1.0 M MgSO4 (7H2O); 1.0 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.5); 0.5M NH4Cl; 50 mM K2HPO4, Fe, vitamins and minerals<strong>[1]</strong>] supplemented with either 4 mM L-glutamic acid [glutamate] or 10 mM sodium acetate [acetate]. The concentrations of acetate and glutamate contain comparable amounts of carbon. There was variation in the nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) provided in the media. Inorganic N, as ammonium chloride, was supplied in all media. Organic N was available in both the complex and glutamate containing media. Organic carbon in the complex medium was 8.55x greater (171 mM) than either the glutamate or acetate containing media (both supplied at 20 mM). Combining organic and inorganic N sources, the complex medium (at 27 mM N) had 1.6x or 2.2x greater total N than either the glutamate (14 mM) or acetate (10 mM) media, respectively. The C:N ratio for the three media ranged from 1.4 to 6.3 (glutamate to complex). In our experiments, P was provided in non-limiting concentrations. Inorganic P was provided as 1 mM potassium phosphate, a non-limiting concentration for roseobacters<strong>[2]</strong>, in all media. Organic P was only available in the complex medium, as a component of both tryptone and yeast extract.</p><p><br></p><p>A total of 10 mL of overnight cultures of strains pre-conditioned on the media type were sub-cultured into 200 mL volumes of fresh media in 500 mL flasks (OD 540 nm \u2248 0.17). Aliquots were immediately taken and indicated as \u201c0 h\u201d samples. Growth was monitored by OD 540 nm every 2 h for 24 h. It is noted that growth dynamics of the strains in large volume flasks differs from prior reports in 10 mL test tubes<strong>[3]</strong>. However, the induction phenotype remains consistent (i.e., CB-A produces measurable infectious particles in non-inducing conditions while CB-D does not).</p><p><br></p><p>Aliquots were taken for metabolite and lipid analysis as well as viable counts and spontaneous prophage induction were taken at 0, 4, 8 and 21 h for complex grown cells and 0, 10, 18 and 24 h for glutamate and acetate grown cells.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Metabolite data collection and analysis</strong></p><p>For metabolite analysis, 5 mL of bacterial cells were rapidly collected (&lt; 30 s) on polycarbonate filters (0.4 \u00b5m) via vacuum filtration and immediately placed in extraction solvent to quench metabolism.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Lipid data collection and analysis</strong></p><p>For lipid analysis, 5 mL of bacterial cells were centrifuged at 4,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 \u00b0C.

Area under the curve (AUC) was integrated and normalized to cell density (OD 540 nm) to obtain per cell metabolite abundances. It was confirmed that the relationship between OD and viable cells are similar for the two strains within a given media type. Ratios of these values from each strain at a given time point and growth condition was used to determine relative concentrations of metabolites.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Lipid data collection and analysis</strong></p><p>The phospholipids were then identified by exact mass and retention time by comparison to an in-house standard library using <strong>MAVEN</strong>. Aminolipids were also identified by exact mass using <strong>MAVEN</strong>. Aminolipids were confirmed using isotopic patterns as well as fragmentation data gathered by all ion fragmentation utilizing high energy collision dissociation (HCD). Aminolipids KL, OL and QL were detected at retention times of 10.7, 10.6 and 2.5 min, respectively. Statistical analyses were performed on the OD normalized AUC as done for the metabolite analysis.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Clasquin MF, Melamud E, Rabinowitz JD.
