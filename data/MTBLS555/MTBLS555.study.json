                "description": "The ability of microorganisms to use root-derived metabolites as growth substrates is a key trait for success in the rhizospheric niche. However, few studies describe which specific metabolites are consumed, or to what degree microbial strains differ in their substrate consumption patterns. Here we present an LC-MS exometabolomic study of three bacterial strains cultivated using either glucose or Arabidopsis thaliana root extract as the sole carbon source in the growth medium. Two of the strains were previously isolated from field-grown Arabidopsis roots, the other is Escherichia coli included as a comparison. When cultivated on root-extract, a set of 62 MS-features were commonly taken up by all three strains, with m/z values matching to components of central metabolism (including amino acids and purine/pyrimidine derivatives). Escherichia coli took up very few MS-features outside of this commonly consumed set, whereas the root-inhabiting strains took up a much larger number of MS-features, many with m/z values matching to plant-specific metabolites. This approach provides new mechanistic insights into microbial community composition in the rhizosphere, by defining the metabolic niche of a given strain. Furthermore, we document a large number of MS-features released by these strains, which could play roles in cross-feeding, antibiosis or signalling.",

                        "description": "Arabidopsis plants were cultivated using anchored shaking liquid culture, according to the method of [1]. First, seeds were surfaced sterilised with 2 min in 70% ethanol, followed by 5 min in 50% bleach, followed by 5\u00d7 rinses in sterile Milli-Q water.  Then, 15-20 seeds were pipetted onto steel mesh discs lying on agar plates (0.7% Agar, 1% sucrose, 0.5\u00d7 MS, pH 5.8), and incubated at 4 \u00b0C in darkness for 2 days. Next, plates were transferred to a growth cabinet, operating at 22 \u00b0C, 16 hrs photoperiod, 120 \u03bcE m-2 light intensity for 7 days. Then, steel disks containing the anchored seedlings plants were transferred to 250 ml Erlenmeyer flasks, containing 15 ml of growth medium (3% sucrose, 0.5\u00d7 MS, pH 5.8) and placed in a shaking incubator at 100 rpm in the growth chamber. After 10 days on the sucrose-containing medium, the medium was swapped to a medium without sucrose (0.5\u00d7 MS, pH 5.8), and plants were left shaking for 7 days. During shaking cultivation, them medium was exchanged every 3-4 days. Plants were harvested by rinsing the plants twice in 10 mM MgCl2, separating roots from shoots, and immediately snap-freezing the root tissue in liquid N2. Root tissue was ground in liquid N2 using a mortar and pestle, and metabolites were extracted by adding 1 ml of 90% MeOH to 200 mg of ground tissue, followed by 30 min incubation at 60 \u00b0C with 1500 rpm shaking. Extracts were then centrifuged at 20,000\u00d7 g for 10 min, and 850 \u03bcl of supernatant was dried using a vacuum centrifuge. Next, metabolite extracts were dissolved in Milli-Q water and filter sterilised (Millipore, 0.22 \u03bcm pore size). Total organic carbon was measured using a Dimatoc 2000 (Dimatec).</br></br>\n\nBacterial growth media was based on M9 formulation (CSHL, 2010). Nutrient concentrations were: 24 mM Na2HPO4, 20 mM NH4Cl, 11 mM KH2PO4, 4 mM NaCl, 350 \u03bcM MgSO4, 100 \u03bcM CaCl2, 50 \u03bcM Fe-EDTA, 50 \u03bcM H3BO3, 10 \u03bcM MnCl2, 1.75 \u03bcM ZnCl2, 1 uM KI, 800 nM Na2MoO4, 500 nM CuCl2, 100 nM CoCl2. To this, one carbon source was added, either glucose (10 mM; equivalent to 0.72 mg C/ml), or Arabidopsis root extract (0.72 mg/ml as measured by TOC).</br></br>\n\nBacterial strains were pre-cultivated by streaking glycerol stocks onto TSB-Agar plates (0.5\u00d7 TSB, 1.2% Agar), and incubating at 28 \u00b0C for between 1-4 days. After visible growth, single colonies were picked from plates and inoculated into TSB medium (0.5\u00d7 TSB), and incubated for 24 h at 28 \u00b0C with 200 rpm shaking. Next, cells were harvested by centrifuging 800 \u03bcl of culture at 5,000\u00d7 g for 2 min at RT. These cells were then rinsed 3\u00d7 in sterile 10 mM MgCl2, and resuspended at a final OD600 of 1.0 in sterile MgCl2. For growth assays, 20 \u03bcl of this bacterial suspension was inoculated into 380 \u03bcl of growth medium, in individual wells of a sterile 48-well plate (Corning). These plates were then transferred to a plate reader (Tecan Infinite Pro 100) and incubated at 28 \u00b0C for 24 h with shaking (3 min continuous shaking followed by 7 min stationary, shaking amplitude 3 mm). Culture density at OD600 was measured once per 10 min cycle, without correcting for path length, and derived growth curves were analysed using the Growthcurver program (Sprouffske and Wagner, 2016). Three independent biological replicates were conducted, whereby each replicate derived from a separate plant cultivation and also a separate bacterial cultivation. As a negative control (without bacteria), we also included samples where growth media were incubated with sterile MgCl2 instead of being inoculated with bacteria.\n</br></br>\nRef:</br>\n[1] H\u00e9tu, M.F., Tremblay, L.J., and Lefebvre, D.D.
