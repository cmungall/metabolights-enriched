                "description": "Diatoms contribute as a major group of microalgae to approximately 20% of the global carbon fixation. In the plankton, these algae are exposed to a plethora of metabolites, especially when competing algae are lysed. In line with evidence that these phototrophs can also engage in heterotrophy we asked about the scope of uptake of organic material from lysed competitors. Using labelled metabolites released during lysis of algae grown under a 13CO2 atmosphere, we show that the cosmopolitan diatom Chaetoceros didymus takes up organic substrates with little bias. The newly developed pulse label / metabolomics analyses revealed not only uptake, but also diverse catabolic and anabolic usage of acquired metabolites. One of the most dominant phytoplankton groups is thus competing with other heterotrophs for organic material, suggesting that a form of absorbotrophy may have substantial impact on organic material fluxes in the oceans. This calls for refinement of our understanding of competition in the plankton.",

                        "description": "<p><strong>Standards</strong></p><p>Arachidonic acid, betaine, carnitine hydrochloride, choline chloride, 11Z-eicosenoic acid, 2- hydroxytetradecanoic acid, isoleucine, leucine and 1-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine were obtained from Sigma Aldrich (Munich, Germany). Oleic acid was purchased from AppliChem (Darmstadt, Germany). Linoleic acid was from Alfa Aesar (Haverhill, MA, USA). 5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z-Eicosapentaenoic acid was supplied by Cayman Chemicals (Ann Arbor, MI, USA) and 6Z,9Z,12Z-Hexadecatrienoic acid from Larodan (Solna, Sweden). 6Z,9Z,12Z,15-Hexadecatetraenoic acid has been synthesized according to Pohnert, Adolph and Wichard<strong>[1]</strong>. \u00df-Alanine betaine has been synthesized according to Chary, Kumar, Vairamani and Prabhakar<strong>[2]</strong> Leucine and isoleucine were not baseline separated and are consequently grouped as (iso-)leucine.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Experimental design</strong></p><p>Diatoms were grown under optimum conditions and exposed to a labeled metabolome of a competitor. The diatoms were extracted using optimized protocols for metabolomics sampling and extracts were analysed by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry to evaluate the uptake of labeled metabolites.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Algal culturing</strong></p><p><strong><em>C. didymus </em></strong>was isolated by W. Kooistra from the Gulf of Naples (Stazione Zoologica Anton Dohrn, Naples, Italy) and<strong> <em>S. costatum</em> </strong>was obtained from the Roscoff Culture Collection (Roscoff, France). Both algae were cultivated in batch culture using artificial seawater medium<strong>[3]</strong> in 50 mL Greiner Bio-One cell culture flasks at 11-13 \u00b0C under a 14:10 h light : dark regime with an illumination of 20-25 \u00b5mol photons m-2/s. Development of cultures was followed by in-vivo Chl a fluorescence using a Mithras LB 940 plate reader (excitation 430 nm, 379 emission 665 nm).&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Global 13 C-labeling</strong></p><p>For global 13 C-labeling of <strong><em>S. costatum </em></strong>we used autoclaved artificial seawater medium that was prepared without addition of NaHCO3. An aliquot of this medium was utilized to dissolve NaH13 CO3 (98 atom %, Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany). This solution, containing sufficient NaH13 CO3 to reach a final concentration of 2.38 mM, was sterile filtered (0.2 \u00b5m pore size, 386 Sarstedt Filtropur S) and transferred back to the medium bottle. Tissue culture flasks were filled to the neck in order to minimize the area for CO2 exchange with the atmosphere and were inoculated with &lt; 1 % (v/v) of a stationary <strong><em>S. costatum </em></strong>culture. After growing to stationary phase, an aliquot was taken and transferred to fresh 13 C-enriched medium (&lt; 1 % (v/v)). After 2 of these cycles a plateau in the degree of labeling (verified by mass spectrometry as described below) was reached and the cultures were used for further experiments.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Bacterial culturing</strong></p><p><strong><em>K. algicida</em></strong> <strong>[4]</strong> was cultivated on marine broth agar at 30 \u00b0C for 2 days. The bacterial lawn was removed with a sterile cotton swab and re-suspended in algal culturing medium to an OD550 of 0.5 determined on a Genesys 10S UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 397 Waltham, MA, USA).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Co-culturing experiment and extraction of released metabolites</strong></p><p><strong><em>S. costatum</em></strong> cultures reared in 12C or 13 C medium were co-cultured in triplicates (185 mL each) with the K. algicida added to a final OD550 of 0.01. After 6 days the lysed cultures were gently filtered (0.2 \u00b5m pore size) and the flow-through extracted for metabolome analysis as follows. Solid phase extraction cartridges (Chromabond easy, Macherey-Nagel, D\u00fcren, Germany) were equilibrated with 4 mL of methanol (Chromasolv Plus, Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany) and 4 mL of water (Chromasolv Plus, Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany) before the filtrate (170 mL) was applied using vacuum with a flow rate &lt; 1 L/h. The cartridge was washed with 4 mL water, air-dried and then extracted via gravity flow using 2 mL of methanol followed by 2 mL of methanol/tetrahydrofuran 1:1 (tetrahydrofuran HiPerSolv, VWR, Dresden, Germany). This extract was frozen until further chemical analysis.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Tests for mixotrophy</strong></p><p>Stationary cultures (45 mL) of <strong><em>S. costatum</em></strong> reared in 12C or 13 C medium were centrifuged (500 x g, 15 min, 10\u00b0C) and washed three times by repeated addition of 45 mL of 12 C medium to the harvested pellets and centrifugation. After the third washing step the supernatant was collected as control medium (this was processed in parallel to the cells and later served as control for the natural 13CO2) and the cell pellet was re-suspended in 45 mL 12 C medium. To disrupt cells, the suspension was frozen at -20\u00b0C, thawed and treated in an ice-cold ultrasonic bath for 10 min. The lysate was filtered (1.2 \u00b5m pore size, GF/C, Whatman, GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, United Kingdom), acidified to pH \u2264 1 for sterilization using 30% hydrochloric acid, incubated at 0\u00b0C for 10 min and subsequently neutralized under sterile conditions using a saturated sodium hydroxide solution. The solutions were stored at -20\u00b0C until use. After thawing, the solutions were diluted 1:1 with 12 C medium to yield the final medium for the investigation of mixotrophy (12C organic &amp; 12C inorganic or 13C organic &amp; 12 C inorganic). 45 mL aliquots of both media 424were extracted as described above for exometabolomic analysis to determine the organic metabolites. For determination of mixotrophy 110 mL aliquots of these media were inoculated with 1% (v/v) stationary C. didymus culture in triplicates and cultivated for 3 days. Directly after inoculation and after 3 days of cultivation, samples (45 mL each) for intra- and extracellular metabolomics were processed. Samples were filtered (1.2 \u00b5m, GF/C, Whatman, GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, United Kingdom) and the flow-through processed for exometabolomic analysis as described above (see co-culturing experiment). The cells were washed off the filter with an ice-cold freshly prepared mixture of methanol/ethanol/chloroform (1:3:1) (ethanol LiChroSolv, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany; chloroform HiPerSolv, VWR, 433 Dresden, Germany). Extracts were treated in an ultrasonic bath for 10 min, centrifuged (30,000 x g, 15 min, 4\u00b0C) and the supernatant was stored at -20\u00b0C. As a control to prove that no NaH13 CO3 enrichment was present in mixotrophic media, the third wash supernatant (see above) was used as medium to cultivate C. didymus and metabolites were extracted as described.

Isotopologue detection was achieved with <strong>R</strong>-based <strong>X13CMS[2]</strong>. The R script can be found in the Supplementary Information of the paper associated with this study. In brief, after peak-picking with centwave (3 ppp, peakwidth 5-20 s) and retention time alignment with orbiwarp, isotopologues with a mass difference of 1.00335 Da were assigned (RTwindow 10 s, 3 ppm). Either all isotopologue groups (\u03b1 = 1) or only isotopologue groups significantly different from 12C (\u03b1 = 0.05) were reported. Afterwards, significantly increased isotopologue groups were manually curated with reference to the original spectrum in order to exclude groups that did not contain at least 3 consecutive isotopologues.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Adusumilli R, Mallick P.
