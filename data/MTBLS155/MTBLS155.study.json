                "description": "Phytoplankton are known to release organic compounds that fuel secondary production by heterotrophic bacteria. Here we show that an abundant marine cyanobacterium, Synechococcus elongatus, contributes a variety of nitrogen-rich and sulfur-containing compounds to dissolved organic matter. A combination of targeted and untargeted metabolomics and genomic tools was used to characterize the intracellular and extracellular metabolites of S. elongatus. Aromatic compounds such as 4-hydroxybenzoic acid and phenylalanine, as well as nucleosides (e.g., thymidine, 5\u2019-methylthioadenosine, xanthosine), the organosulfur compound 3-mercaptopropionate, and the plant auxin indole 3-acetic acid, were detected in the extracellular metabolites at multiple time points during the growth of S. elongatus. Further, the amino acid kynurenine was found to accumulate in the media even though it was not included in the predicted metabolome of S. elongatus. This suggests that not all metabolites produced by an organism can be predicted from its genome sequence. Some metabolites may be products of non-enzymatic reactions and are likely excreted into the environment as waste. The compounds described herein provide excellent targets for quantitative analysis in field settings to assess the source and lability of dissolved organic matter in situ.",

A starter culture in exponential phase was used to inoculate 12 flasks of media with 10% of the volume (30 ml).  Another six flasks contained only the media as cell-free  controls.  The cultures were maintained at room temperature under a 12:12 light:dark regime (56 \u03bcmol/m2/s) and were sampled at approximately 30 min into the light cycle, at each time point.  Cultures were grown for three weeks and samples were taken on days: 0, 2, 8, 10, 15, and 17.  Cells were captured by gentle vacuum filtration on 0.2 \u00b5m Omnipore (Millipore) filters. The filtrate was acidified to a pH=3 and extracted immediately. The filters were stored at  80 \u00baC until extraction could occur in one batch for the entire experiment. ",

Briefly, the filter was extracted three times with ice-cold extraction solvent (acetonitrile:methanol:water with 0.1 M formic acid, 40:40:20). The combined extracts were neutralized with ammonium hydroxide and dried in a vacufuge.\n</p>\nThe samples for the targeted mass spectrometry analysis were re-dissolved in 90:10 (v/v) water:acetonitrile and combined with deuterated biotin (final concentration 0.05 \u00b5g/ml) as an internal standard.\n</p>\nFor untargeted analysis, the extracts had to undergo an additional de-salting step prior to analysis. Therefore, the dried extracts were re-dissolved in 0.01 M hydrochloric acid and extracted using a 50 mg/1 cc PPL cartridge following the protocol of [2]. The resulting methanol extracts were re-dissolved in 95:5 water:acetonitrile.\n</p>\nThe filtrate for each sample, representing the extracellular metabolite fraction, was processed using SPE as described above (following [1]) but with 1 g/6 cc cartridges. The extracellular metabolite extract was redissolved in 500 \u00b5l of 95:5 water:acetonitrile for both targeted and untargeted metabolomics analysis.\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Rabinowitz JD, Kimball E.

Untargeted metabolomics data were collected as XCalibur RAW files which were converted to mzXML files using the msConvert tool within ProteoWizard [1]. Features were extracted from the LC-MS data using XCMS [2], where a feature is defined as a unique combination of a mass-to-charge (m/z) ratio and a retention time. Peak finding was performed with the centWave algorithm [3], and only peaks that fit a Gaussian shape were retained. Features were aligned across samples based on retention time and m/z value using the group.nearest function in XCMS; fillPeaks was used to reconsider features missed in the initial peak finding steps. CAMERA [4] was used to extract the intensities and m/z values for the associated MS/MS spectra.\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Chambers MC, Maclean B, Burke R, Amodei D, Ruderman DL, Neumann S, Gatto L, Fischer B, Pratt B, Egertson J, Hoff K, Kessner D, Tasman N, Shulman N, Frewen B, Baker TA, Brusniak MY, Paulse C, Creasy D, Flashner L, Kani K, Moulding C, Seymour SL, Nuwaysir LM, Lefebvre B, Kuhlmann F, Roark J, Rainer P, Detlev S, Hemenway T, Huhmer A, Langridge J, Connolly B, Chadick T, Holly K, Eckels J, Deutsch EW, Moritz RL, Katz JE, Agus DB, MacCoss M, Tabb DL, Mallick P.

Putative identifications were confirmed, where possible, with commercial standards analyzed by our methods (i.e. kynurenine, tryptophan).\n</p>\nThe targeted metabolomics compound identifications were based on measurements of authentic standards on the same mass spectrometer. Note that the LC/mass spectrometry system cannot distinguish between leucine and isoleucine, therefore the data are presented as 'leucine/isoleucine'. Similiarly, threonine and homeserine are not analytically distinct and are presented as 'threonine/homoserine'.\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Smith CA, O'Maille G, Want EJ, Qin C, Trauger SA, Brandon TR, Custodio DE, Abagyan R, Siuzdak G.
