                "description": "<p>Mechanical force is critical for the development and remodeling of bone. Here we report that mechanical force regulates the production of the metabolite asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) via regulating the hydrolytic enzyme dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase 1 (Ddah1) expression in osteoblasts. The presence of -394 4N del/ins polymorphism of Ddah1 and higher serum ADMA concentration are negatively associated with bone mineral density. Global or osteoblast-specific deletion of Ddah1 leads to increased ADMA level but reduced bone formation. Further molecular study unveils that mechanical stimulation enhances TAZ/SMAD4-induced Ddah1 transcription. Deletion of Ddah1 in osteoblast-lineage cells fails to respond to mechanical stimulus-associated bone formation. Taken together, the study reveals mechanical force is capable of down-regulating ADMA to enhance bone formation.</p>",

Male Ddah1f/f and Ddah1Prx1 mice were sacrificed at 12 weeks of age. Male and female Ddah2+/- mice (C57BL/6N-Ddah2tm1cyagen) were offered by Cyagen Biology Technology. Female Wild type C57BL/6 (B6) mice were from the SLAC Laboratory Animal Company (Shanghai, China).

Precusor tolerance was set 5 ppm, fragment tolerance was set 10 ppm, and retention time (RT) tolerance was set 0.02 min. Internal standard detection parameters were deselected for peak RT alignment, isotopic peaks were excluded for analysis, and noise elimination level was set at 10.00, minimum intensity was set to 15% of base peak intensity. The Excel file was obtained with 3D data sets including m/z, peak RT and peak intensities, and RT-m/z pairs were used as the identifier for each ion. The resulting matrix was further reduced by removing any peaks with missing value (ion intensity = 0) in more than 50% samples. The internal standard was used for data QC (reproducibility). Metabolites were identified by <strong>progenesis QI </strong>(WatersCorporation, Milford, USA) Data Processing Software, based on public databases and self-built databases. The positive and negative data were combined to get a combine data which was imported into <strong>R</strong> '<strong>ropls' </strong>package. Principle component analysis (PCA) and (orthogonal) partial least-squares-discriminant analysis (O)PLS-DA were carried out to visualize the metabolic alterations among experimental groups, after mean centering (Ctr) and Pareto variance (Par) scaling, respectively. The Hotelling\u2019s T2 region, shown as an ellipse in score plots of the models, defines the 95% confidence interval of the modeled variation. Variable importance in the projection (VIP) ranks the overall contribution of each variable to the OPLS-DA model, and those variables with VIP&gt;1 are considered relevant for group discrimination. In this study, the default 7-round cross-validation was applied with 1/seventh of the samples being excluded from the mathematical model in each round, in order to guard against over fitting. The differential metabolites were selected on the basis of the combination of a statistically significant threshold of variable influence on projection (VIP) values obtained from the OPLS-DA model and p values from a two-tailed Student\u2019s t test on the normalized peak areas, where metabolites with VIP values larger than 1.0 and p values less than 0.05 were considered as differential metabolites.</p>",
