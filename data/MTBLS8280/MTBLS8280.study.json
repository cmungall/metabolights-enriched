                "description": "<p>Ferroptosis is a form of regulated cell death with roles in degenerative diseases and cancer. Excessive iron-catalyzed peroxidation of membrane phospholipids, especially those containing the polyunsaturated fatty acid arachidonic acid (AA), is central in driving ferroptosis. Here, we reveal that an understudied Golgi-resident scaffold protein, MMD, promotes susceptibility to ferroptosis in ovarian and renal carcinoma cells in an ACSL4- and MBOAT7-dependent manner. Mechanistically, MMD physically interacts with both ACSL4 and MBOAT7, two enzymes that catalyze sequential steps to incorporate AA in phosphatidylinositol (PI) lipids. Thus, MMD increases the flux of AA into PI, resulting in heightened cellular levels of AA-PI and other AA-containing phospholipid species. This molecular mechanism points to a pro-ferroptotic role for MBOAT7 and AA-PI, with potential therapeutic implications, and reveals that MMD is an important regulator of cellular lipid metabolism.</p>",

THP-1 cells (human male acute monocytic leukemia cells) were obtained from Jaime Cheah (Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research) and cultured in RPMI supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS and 1% P/S. To induce differentiation to macrophage-like cells, THP-1 cells were incubated in media containing 100 nM phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, Sigma-Aldrich) for 48 h, followed by media without PMA for 24 h. All cells were cultured in a humidified incubator at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2.

LipidSearch matches MS/MS data in the experimental data with spectral data in the HCD database. Precursor ion tolerance was set to 5 ppm, product ion tolerance was set to 10 ppm. LipidSearch nomenclature uses underscores to separate the fatty acyl chains to indicate the lack of sn positional information (e.g. PC(16:0_18:1) and not (PC(16:0/18:1)). In cases where there is insufficient MS/MS data to identify all acyl chains, only the sum of the chains is displayed (i.e. PC(34:1)). Following the peak search, positive and negative mode data were aligned together where possible (where positive and negative mode data were collected on separate occasions data were aligned separately) and raw peak areas for all annotated lipids were exported to Microsoft Excel and filtered according to the following predetermined quality control criteria: Rej ('Reject' parameter calculated by LipidSearch) equal to 0; PQ ('Peak Quality' parameter calculated by LipidSearch software) greater than 0.75; CV (standard deviation / mean peak area across triplicate injections of a represented (pooled) biological sample) below 0.4; R (linear correlation across a 3-point dilution series of the representative (pooled) biological sample) greater than 0.9. Typically, ~70% of annotated lipids passed all 4 quality control criteria. Redundant lipid ions (those with identical retention times and multiple adducts) were removed such that only one lipid ion per species / per unique retention time is reported in merged alignments. For data where positive and negative mode data were aligned separately some redundancies may still exist. Raw peak areas of the filtered lipids were normalized to total lipid signal (positive or negative ionization mode) in each sample to control for sample loading.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Untargeted lipidomics - datasets 2 and 4 - 'HEN' string in sample name</strong></p><p>Raw data were processed using TraceFinder software (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for targeted peak integration and manual review of a subset of identified lipids and using Progenesis QI (Nonlinear Dynamics) for peak detection and integration of both lipids of known identify and unknowns. Lipid identities were determined based on comparison to reference plasma extracts and are denoted by total number of carbons in the lipid acyl chain(s) and total number of double bonds in the lipid acyl chain(s).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Polar metabolomics - dataset - 'QE' string in sample name</strong></p><p>Relative quantitation of polar metabolites was performed with TraceFinder 4.1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using a 5 ppm mass tolerance and referencing an in-house library of chemical standards.
