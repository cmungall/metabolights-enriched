                "description": "We report here that a straightforward change of the standard derivatization procedure for GC\u2013MS metabolomics is leading to a strong increase in metabolite signal intensity. Drying samples between methoxymation and trimethylsilylation significantly increased signals by two- to tenfold in extracts of yeast cells, plant and animal tissue, and human urine. This easy step reduces the cost of sample material and the need for expensive new hardware.",

Urine was aliquoted into 200 \u03bcl samples and prepared, including the depletion of urea with urease, precipitation of urease with methanol and extraction of metabolites. The plant material was  prepared using the method for global plant metabolomics[2]. Briefly, shock-frozen leaf tissue was grinded with a mortar and pestle (all liquid N2 cooled), 100 mg powder was extracted with methanol and strong agitation, chloroform and water was added and the sample mixed. After phase-separation the upper layer was taken for metabolite analysis. Animal tissue (common earthworm, Lumbricus terrestris) was collected and extracted as described previously[3]. Briefly, the shock-frozen whole animal was grinded with a mortar and pestle (all liquid N2 cooled), 50 mg powder was extracted with methanol and strong agitation, chloroform and water was added and the sample mixed. After phase-separation the upper layer was taken for metabolite analysis. All final extracts were dried under vacuum (Extractor Plus, Agilent; settings: 30 \u00b0C, 2 h, 1000 rpm, VAQ).\n</br></br>\nFor step 1 of the derivatization procedure, the oximation, 80 \u03bcl methoxylamine hydrochloride (anhydrous) in pyridine (0.005% H2O) (20 mg/ml) was added to the dry sample and incubated under shaking (1350 rpm) at 37 \u00b0C for 90 mins. Afterwards, the sample was centrifuged for 30 s with a table-top centrifuge to spin down any remaining liquid from the lid. The sample was subsequently evaporated to dryness under a constant stream of nitrogen for 60 mins at 21 \u00b0C and subsequently trimethylsilylated with 100 \u03bcl BSTFA for 30 mins, 1350 rpm, 37 \u00b0C. Samples not treated with a drying step were left at 21 \u00b0C for 60 mins before trimethylsilylation to have comparable controls. The MSTFA experiments were done in the same way, exchanging BSTFA against MSTFA only. For the derivatization with MTBSTFA we used 20 \u03bcl methoxymation reagent (1st step, 90 mins at 37 \u00b0C) and in the 2nd step 80 \u03bcl N-(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)-N-methyltrifluoroacetamide (60 mins at 70 \u00b0C).\n</br></br>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Chan EC, Pasikanti KK, Nicholson JK.

Samples were run according to methods recommended for metabolome databases[1]. Briefly, 1 \u03bcl sample was injected in splitless mode with an Agilent 7693 autosampler injector into deactivated splitless liner (Agilent 5190-3167, splitless, single taper, glass wool). Separation was done on an Agilent 30 m DB5-MS column with a 10 m DuraGuard column. Oven temperatures were set to 60 \u00b0C for 2 mins, and then headed with 10 \u00b0C/min up to 325 \u00b0C and set to hold for 5 min at 325 \u00b0C.\n</br></br>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Kind T, Wohlgemuth G, Lee DY, Lu Y, Palazoglu M, Shahbaz S, Fiehn O.
