                        "description": "In a 3-year study from 2004 to 2006, spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv. Triso) and 13 associated weed species were exposed in a chamberless mini-FACE system. The field site contains 15 circular field plots (2 m diameter) and is located at Heidfeldhof, a farm managed by the Plant Breeding Station of the University of Hohenheim (9 Degrees 11 minutes E, 48 Degrees 42 Minutes N, 395 m asl), south of Stuttgart (Germany).\n</p>\nIn each of the 3 years, the plots with local soil (slightly stagnic luvisol) were manually dug to a depth of 30 cm at the end of March. Wheat as the main crop was sown in lines at a spacing of 15 cm, seed distance of 1.5 cm and depth of 2 cm to a density of 200 plants/sqm. Based on agronomic practice recommended for spring wheat, the plots were fertilised with 140 kg nitrogen (N)/ha, 30 kg phosphorus (P)/ha and 60 kg potassium (K)/ha at 50 / 25 / 25% at different development stages of the plants (EC 13\u201329, EC 30\u201339 and EC 40\u201359; [1]). In addition, on EC 30\u201339, a trace element fertiliser was applied containing 0.03 kg boron (B) /ha, 0.45 kg magnesium (Mg)/ha, 0.36 kg sulphur (S)/ha and 0.03 kg manganese (Mn)/ha. Soil moisture was measured using time-domain reflectometry (TDR) sensors (IMKO, Ettlingen, Germany). Plots were manually irrigated, if necessary, with the same amount of water applied to all treatments. Irrigation volumes were noted and taken into account for calculation of total water supply, including precipitation amounts.\n</p>\nThe CO2 exposure involved three treatments with five replicates each: (i) CONTROL plots with ambient air CO2 concentration without technical equipment, (ii) AMBIENT plots with ambient air CO2 concentration and the frame system (AMB), and (iii) FACE plots with elevated CO2 concentration and the frame system (ELE). The exposure started before seed emergence and continued until final harvest. To achieve a target gas concentration of 150 \u00b5l/l above AMBIENT (24 hr average), pure CO2 was released directly into the plant canopy through an injection system and regulated according to wind direction and velocity to maintain the set concentration. The CO2 concentrations achieved at canopy height were monitored in the centre of each field plot. Additional information on the performance of the system is given elsewhere ([2][3][4]).\n</p>\nWheat plants from the central square metre of each plot were harvested at crop maturity and separated into leaves, stems and ears. Dry weights (DW) of the different biomass fractions were determined after drying until constant weight (leaf and stem at 60 \u00baC, ear at room temperature). Ear numbers were counted and grains were extracted from the ears. Total grain weights were measured and thousand grain weights (TGW) were determined using a seed counter (Condator 'E', Pfeuffer, Winnenden, Germany). Grains were further separated into size classes (>2.8; 2.8e2.5; 2.5e2.2; <2.2 mm) using a Sortimat (Type K, Pfeuffer, Winnenden, Germany).\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Tottman D.R.

Converted files were then uploaded to MeltDB (https://meltdb.cebitec.uni-bielefeld.de) into an experiment consisting of four chromatogram groups for harvest years 2005 and 2006 with ambient (AMB) and elevated (ELE) CO2. In order to assess the grouping performance, we performed a peak detection with XCMS [1], using the matched filter method with a signal-to-noise ratio of 5 and full-width at half height of 5 in order to find well represented peaks. The peak finding step reported between 410 and 465 peaks per chromatogram. The apex scan indices for each chromatogram's peaks were stored in one tab separated value file for each chromatogram. We chose signals as reported from the Data Transformation/Peak Finding step within a retention time window of +/- 30 s. To be counted as a complete group, the scans corresponding to the tags were required to have a pairwise cosine similarity between their binned mass spectra of >0.99 throughout all chromatograms and a maximum mass deviation of 0.01 Dalton. The selection process lead to 184 peak groups containing peaks appearing in all chromatograms, which defined our ground truth for the evaluation of the multiple alignments produced by our methods. This reference selection and grouping was performed by a profiling method, which was recently added to MeltDB [2].\n</p>\nParameters used in the assay:</br>\nXCMS Peak Detection: snr=5;fwhm=5</br>\nMetDB Metabolite Profiling: massDeviation=0.01 Da;sim=Cosine;simThreshold=0.99;deltaRt=+/-30 seconds</br>\nThe Multiple Alignment Reference File is present in the study folder as xcms-meltdb.csv.\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Smith CA, Want EJ, O'Maille G, Abagyan R, Siuzdak G.
