                "description": "Aberrant sterol lipid metabolism is associated with physiological dysfunctions in the aging brain and aging-dependent disorders such as neurodegenerative diseases. There is an unmet demand to comprehensively profile sterol lipids spatially and temporally in different brain regions during aging. Here, we develop an ion mobility-mass spectrometry based four-dimensional sterolomics technology leveraged by a machine learning-empowered high-coverage library (>2000 sterol lipids) for accurate identification. We apply this four-dimensional technology to profile the spatially resolved landscapes of sterol lipids in ten functional regions of the mouse brain, and quantitatively uncover ~200 sterol lipids uniquely distributed in specific regions with concentrations spanning up to 8 orders of magnitude. Further spatial analysis pinpoints age-associated differences in region-specific sterol lipid metabolism, revealing changes in the numbers of altered sterol lipids, concentration variations, and age-dependent coregulation networks. These findings will contribute to our understanding of abnormal sterol lipid metabolism and its role in brain diseases.",

Mice (C57BLJ6; female; 6- and 68-wk, n=6 in each group) were first anesthetized with isofluorance vapour and sacrificed by decapitation. The whole brain was manually divided into different subregions by referring to the mouse brain atlas<strong>[1]</strong>. Brain tissue was kept in ice-cold dissection buffer (212.7 mM sucrose, 5 mM KCl, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM CaCl2, 26 mM NaHCO3, and 10 mM dextrose, bubbled with 95% O2/5% CO2 (pH 7.4)) during the whole process to prevent neural excitotoxicity and maintain viability. Tissue was directly frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept in -80 \u00b0C before further experiment. It took approximately 15 min to fully dissect 1 mouse brain immediately after euthanasia. All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Interdisciplinary Research Center on Biology and Chemistry, Shanghai Institute of Organic Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and complied with all relevant ethical regulations. The 6- and 68-wk old female mice were purchased from Xiamen University Laboratory Animal Center (Xiamen, China).</p><p><br></p><p>For the preparation of mouse liver tissue samples, the mice were anesthetized by isoflurane vapor before sacrifice (C57BLJ6; n=6; 24-wk), and livers were quickly taken, and dissected on ice. Dissected livers were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored in -80 \u00b0C for subsequent extraction of sterol lipids.

                        "description": "<p>Extraction of sterol lipids followed the method published by our group<strong>[1]</strong>. In brief, the frozen brain tissue was weighted and homogenized in H2O (every mg of tissue with 20 \u03bcl of H2O) using homogenizer (Precellys 24, Bertin Technologies, France). The whole homogenization process was operated under liquid nitrogen cooling. 10 \u03bcl of butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) solvent (6.5 \u03bcg dissolved in 10 \u03bcl of MeOH) was added into the sample before homogenization to avoid possible oxidation during sample preparation. Then, 100 \u03bcl of homogenized solution was taken for each sample and mixed individually with 30 \u03bcl of deuterated internal standards solution (IS; 10 ng of d6-desmosterol, 10 ng of d7-cholesterol, and 10 ng of d6-27-hydroxycholesterol), and further diluted to 200 \u03bcl by adding H2O. 800 \u03bcl of the extraction solvent DCM/MeOH (2:1; v/v) containing 6.5 \u03bcg BHT was added for extraction. The solution was vortexed for 30 s, followed by 10 min of sonication, and 15 min of centrifugation at 3000 rpm at 4 \u00b0C. The bottom organic layer was collected (400 \u03bcl). An additional 400 \u03bcl of DCM was added to the rest layer for re-extraction. The extraction was repeated 3x in total. The pooled organic layer was evaporated using a vacuum concentrator (LABCONCO) at 4 \u00b0C.</p><p><br></p><p>For hydrolysis, the dried extract was mixed with 500 \u03bcl of methanol solution containing 1.0 M potassium hydroxide and 6.5 mg of BHT. The solution was vortexed for 30 s, sonicated for 10 min, and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. Then, 1 ml of hexane was added for extraction. The sample was vortexed for 30 s, sonicated for 10 min in a 4 \u00b0C water bath, and centrifuged for 15 min at 3000 rpm at 4 \u00b0C. The resulting supernatant was collected (600 \u03bcl). For the second extraction, 1.0 ml of hexane was added, and 1.0 ml of supernatant was taken and combined with supernatant in the first extraction, and finally evaporated to dryness using a vacuum concentrator at 4 \u00b0C.</p><p><br></p><p>Sterol derivatization was performed according to the previous method with minor modification<strong>[1]</strong>. The chemicals for derivatization including picolinic acid (53.3 mg), 2-methyl-6-nitrobenzoic anhydride (66.7 mg), and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (3 mg) were sequentially added to pyridine (1 ml). The freshly prepared derivatization reagent (200 \u03bcl) and 5.36 \u03bcl triethylamine were added to the dried extract. The reaction mixture was vortexed for 30 s, and sonicated for 10 min, and incubated at 80 \u00b0C for 60 min. Then 1 ml of hexane was added to samples for extraction. The samples were vortexed for 30 s, sonicated for 10 min (4 \u00b0C water bath), and centrifuged 15 min at 3000 rpm at 4 \u00b0C. Finally, supernatant was collected and evaporated to dryness using a vacuum concentrator at 4 \u00b0C. The dry extract after derivatization was mixed with 400 \u03bcl of dichloromethane and 600 \u03bcl of H2O for sample cleaning. Then the solution was vortexed for 30 s, sonicated for 10 min in a 4 \u00b0C water bath, and centrifuged for 15 min at 3000 rpm at 4 \u00b0C. Next, 400 \u03bcl of upper aqueous layer was removed. Then, another 400 \u03bcl of H2O was added into the rest sample solution for cleaning. The cleaning step was repeated twice. The rest organic layer was collected and evaporated to dryness using a vacuum concentrator at 4 \u00b0C. The dried extract was kept at -80 \u00b0C and reconstituted using 100 \u03bcl of ACN prior to LC-IM-MS analysis. For the analysis of cholesterol, the samples were first diluted by 50x using ACN before analysis.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Qiu J, Li T, Zhu ZJ.

First, the RT calibration was performed by analyzing retention time quality control (<strong>RTQC</strong>) samples. The RT calibration followed the method published by our group. The RTs of sterol lipids in both libraries are updated after the RT calibration. For 4-D matching against the standard ST library, the MS1 match tolerance was set as 25 ppm. Then, the trapezoidal function was used for scoring RT and CCS matches, which followed the method published by our group in IM-MS based lipidomics (<strong>LipidIMMS Analyzer</strong>)<strong>[1]</strong> and metabolomics (<strong>AllCCS</strong>)<strong>[2]</strong>. For RT match, the minimum and maximum tolerances were set as 0 s and 12 s, respectively. For CCS match, the minimum and maximum tolerances were set as 1% and 1.5%, respectively. The MS/MS spectral match was scored by a reverse dot product algorithm with a cutoff score of 0.6. A linear equation was used to integrate RT match, CCS match and MS/MS spectral match scores. The weights of RT match score, CCS match score and MS/MS match score were 0.2, 0.4 and 0.4, respectively. For 4-D matching against the extended ST library, the MS1 match tolerance was set as 25 ppm. For RT match, the minimum and maximum tolerances were set as 0 s and 30 s, respectively. For CCS match, the minimum and maximum tolerances were set as 1% and 3%, respectively. For MS/MS spectral match, if both skeleton ion [M+H-PA]+ for monohydroxysterols, or [M+Na-PA]+ for dihydroxysterols, and derivate ion [PA+Na]+ were detected, the match score was set as 1.0. If only 1 type of fragment ion was detected, the match score was set as 0.5. The cut-off score for MS/MS match was set as 0.5. Similarly, a linear equation was used to integrate RT match, CCS match and MS/MS spectral match scores. The weights of RT match score, CCS match score and MS/MS match score were 0.2, 0.4 and 0.4, respectively. For 4-D matching against the standard and extended ST libraries, sterol identifications with integrated scores larger than 0.6 were kept.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Zhou Z, Shen X, Chen X, Tu J, Xiong X, Zhu ZJ.
