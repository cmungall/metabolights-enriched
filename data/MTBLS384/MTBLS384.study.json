                "description": "A study was performed to determine if serum-metabolomics could be used to establish a predictive tool for identifying ractopamine misuse in pigs. Ractopamine, a beta-agonist used as growth promoter in livestock, is with great controversy, and it has been forbidden in most countries worldwide. However, due to economic benefits, the possibility of widespread abuse of ractopamine still exists. \u201cOmics\u201d strategies, based on the observation of physiological perturbations, are promising approaches to tackle drug misuse in breeding animals. In this context, our aim was to set up a high performance liquid chromatography - high resolution mass spectrometry (HPLC-HRMS) based metabolomics workflow for screening pig serum for ractopamine administration. Therefore, an untargeted metabolomics approach was developed to characterize and compare serum metabolic profiles from control and treated pigs. Two different extraction strategies were investigated, and the results showed that the combination of methanol extraction and methanol-water extraction protocols significantly improve the metabolites coverage. A two-level data analysis using univariate and multivariate statistical analyses was carried out to establish descriptive and predictive models, which enabled the discrimination of treated animals from control animals and highlighted a number of candidate biomarkers that contributed the most in the observed discrimination. This research indicates that metabolomics approach can be considered as a powerful strategy to highlight biomarkers related to ractopamine treatment in pig which may subsequently be implemented as screening strategy to predict for such illicit practices.",

Animals were allowed a 3-day acclimatization period, following which, each animal received 1.8 kg feed/day. Pigs from the treatment group received then on a daily basis and during 29 days, a feed containing ractopamine hydrochloride (Sigma Aldrich) (10 mg/kg feed). The 10 ppm daily dose was selected as corresponding to classical doses used in finishing pigs. Blood samples were collected at day 3, 9, 16, 18, 23, 29, for both control and treated animals. The blood samples were allowed to clot at room temperature and the serum samples, obtained by centrifugation, were frozen and then stored at -80 \u00b0C. Prior to the extraction, serum samples were allowed to thaw on ice.",

Then the mixture was vortexed for 20 s before centrifugation (2000 r/min, 20 min, 4 \u00b0C). 370 \u00b5l supernatant was collected and then evaporated to dryness under gentle N2 at 30 \u00b0C, and subsequently reconstituted with 150 \u00b5l H2O before HPLC\u2013HRMS analysis.\n</p>\nMethanol\u2013water extraction:</br>\nThe extraction procedure firstly reported[2] and further re-adapted[3] was employed. The procedure consisted of a triphasic liquid\u2013liquid extraction with MeOH:CHCl3:H2O (1:2:0.63). 190 \u00b5l of MeOH was added to 30 \u00b5l serum sample and the mixture was vortexed for 20 s. Following this, 380 \u00b5l of CHCl3 was added and vortexed for 20 s. Finally, 120 \u00b5l of H2O was added to induce phase separation. The sample was further shaken for 10 s and allowed to equilibrate at room temperature for 10 min before centrifugation (2000 r/min, 10 min, 4 \u00b0C). 150 \u00b5l the upper phase (MeOH+H2O) was then collected and evaporated to dryness under gentle N2 at 30 \u00b0C, and subsequently reconstituted with 30 \u00b5l H2O containing 2 ng/\u00b5l of each labeled internal standards before HPLC\u2013HRMS analysis.\n</p>\nQC sample preparation:</br>\nA pooled quality control (QC) sample was prepared by pooling aliquots of all individual study samples. In our study, QC sample was extracted and processed according to the procedures described the above sections respectively. Then, these two reconstitution solutions were combined and mixed thoroughly before HPLC\u2013HRMS analysis. The QC solution is therefore representative of both extraction strategies tested. The same QC solution was injected at the beginning, the end, but also intervals of every 5 samples in each batch run to assure the analytical repeatability and the quality of the fingerprinting process throughout the study.\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Dunn WB, Broadhurst D, Begley P, Zelena E, Francis-McIntyre S, Anderson N, Brown M, Knowles JD, Halsall A, Haselden JN, Nicholls AW, Wilson ID, Kell DB, Goodacre R (2011).

High resolution MS fingerprints were acquired using the following parameters: spray voltage \u00b13 kV; capillary temperature 350 \u00b0C; sheath gas flow rate 55 a.u. (arbitrary units), auxiliary gas flow rate 10 a.u., spare gas flow rate 0; max spray current \u00b1100 \u00b5A; probe heater temperature 300 \u00b0C; S-lens RF level 50. Full scan mass spectra were acquired from m/z 65 to 975 at a mass resolving power of 70,000 Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) at m/z 200. The scan speed was 2 Hz in profile mode. Daily instrument calibration was performed using a MSCAL6 ProteoMass LTQ/FT-Hybrid. Xcalibur 2.2 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA, USA) was used for data acquisition and analysis. In order not to bias statistical analyses or the metabolomics data structure, all the samples for analysis arising from control and treated animals, which were prepared separately by two extraction strategies, were randomized across the whole data acquisition sequence.",

The raw (*.raw) files were subsequently converted to a more exchangeable format (*.mzXML) and polarity split using MSConvert[1]. Further data processing was performed using XCMS[2] software implemented with the R statistical language; multiple steps including: peak alignment, peak picking, retention time alignment followed by a peak grouping and integration step. The resulting XCMS matrix containing MS features for each sample, was subsequently exported to Excel\u00ae for univariate analysis, interbatch normalization and later to SIMCA-P+\u00ae (Version 13, Umetrics AB, Sweden) software for multivariate statistical analysis. The inter-batch instrumental drift may be confused with biological differences if it is not minimized. Therefore, after data processing, the removal of between-batch offsets and drifts was carried out by following the previously described procedure[3], assuming that the measurement errors in a single batch are randomly distributed, and that different batches can be compared and corrected using the average or median value of the QC samples in a batch.\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Kessner D, Chambers M, Burke R, Agus D, Mallick P.

Additionally, results generated after database searches were assessed in relation to metabolites physiochemical properties, spectral similarities, matrix of occurrence and reports in related publications.\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Courant F, Royer AL, Ch\u00e9reau S, Morvan ML, Monteau F, Antignac JP, Le Bizec B.
