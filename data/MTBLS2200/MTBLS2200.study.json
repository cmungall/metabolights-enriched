                "description": "<p>Seawater dissolved organic matter (DOM) is a large reservoir of carbon composed of a complex and poorly characterized mixture of molecules. Sponges have long been known to consume dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from this mixture, but the role of microbial sponge symbionts in this process is complex, and the molecules involved remain largely unknown. In order to better understand how sponge processing changes seawater DOM, we used untargeted metabolomics to characterize DOM in samples of incurrent and excurrent seawater taken from sponges on the fore-reef off Carrie Bow Cay, Belize, over 2 years. We collected samples from three sponge species each with either high or low microbial abundance (HMA, LMA) to explore the relationship between symbiont abundance and DOM alterations. Analyses revealed that sponges took up metabolites and changed the composition of seawater DOM, but only for the three HMA species, and none of the LMA species, implicating microbial symbionts in this uptake. Using a new mass spectra classification tool, we found that putative compositions of features depleted in the excurrent samples of HMA sponges were similar in both years and were dominated by organic acids and derivatives (74%) and organic nitrogen compounds (19%). Interestingly, HMA sponges also took up halogenated compounds (containing chlorine or bromine), providing evidence of a previously unknown mechanism of halide cycling. The metabolites taken up by HMA sponges may be used as a food source or as building blocks of chemical defenses, selective advantages that may have guided the evolution of microbial symbioses in sponges.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2019 collection assay</strong> is reported in the current study <strong>MTBLS2200</strong></p><p><strong>2018 collection assay</strong> is reported in <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS2199' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS2199</strong></a></p>",

                        "description": "<p>Seawater going into (incurrent) and coming out of (excurrent) individual tube- and vase-shaped sponges was collected and analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to characterize changes in seawater dissolved organic matter (DOM). Samples were collected on the fore reef near the Carrie Bow Cay (CBC) field station, Belize, at 13-23 m depths, over 2 years (July 2018 and March 2019). In 2019, we sampled n = 7 individuals each of 2 <strong>high microbial abundance (HMA)</strong> species (<em>X. muta</em> and <em>A. tubulata</em>; see <strong>Table S1</strong> in the paper associated with this study); the choice to sample these 2 species with increased replication in 2019 was based on preliminary analysis of the 2018 data. All species targeted herein are common in the Caribbean and were subjects of a recent study that calculated flux of bulk dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from incurrent and excurrent seawater samples<strong>[1]</strong>. All materials used to collect and store samples were made of glass or chemically inert plastic to minimize contamination. Glassware was combusted (500 \u00b0C for 4 h) prior to each trip, and all materials were sample-rinsed between uses during each trip. Samples were prepared for LC-MS analysis using high purity (Fisher Optima) solvents and additives.</p><p><br></p><p>Samples were collected from sponge individuals &gt;10 m apart and with an atrium (inner empty space) large enough that a diver could maneuver a sample syringe inside without touching the sponge. Before sampling, sponge pumping was confirmed by applying a small amount of fluorescein dye above the sponge atrium and checking for upwards movement indicative of excurrent flow. This dye was allowed to dissipate for at least 5 min before sampling began. 2 divers then collected paired 1 L incurrent and excurrent (In/Ex) seawater samples from the sponge using 50 ml syringes (Norm-Ject Air-Tite) attached via Teflon tubing and a polycarbonate check valve to a 1 L foil sample bag (FlexFoil PLUS, SKC; see <strong>Figure S1A</strong> in the paper associated with this study). The syringes contained no latex, plasticizers, PVC, rubber gaskets, or silicone oil, and the check valve allowed for continuous pumping of sample to gradually fill up the foil bag (see <strong>Figure S1B</strong> in the paper associated with this study). The incurrent seawater sample was collected adjacent to the ostia lining the external sponge surface, and the excurrent sample was collected from approximately 5 cm below the osculum within the atrium of each sponge and at a rate lower than the excurrent water velocity to avoid mixing with ambient seawater. In/Ex samples were collected simultaneously. The In/Ex method is commonly used to measure the in situ metabolic processes of active suspension feeders, such as sponges that usually stop feeding upon being disturbed or removed from their natural habitat<strong>[2]</strong>. Samples were transported back to the lab at CBC immediately (15 min) after collection for filtration and <strong>solid phase extraction (SPE)</strong> as described below. Experimental controls were also made by passing 500 ml water (Fisher Optima) through the sampling mechanism (syringe, foil bag, tubing), filtration apparatus, and SPE apparatus. These were analyzed alongside experimental samples for post-processing removal of contaminants.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> McMurray SE, Stubler AD, Erwin PM, Finelli CM, Pawlik JR (2018) A test of the sponge-loop hypothesis for emergent Caribbean reef sponges.

                        "description": "<p>Waters .<strong>raw datasets</strong> (see <strong>Figure 1A</strong> in the paper associated with this study) were centroided and lockmass corrected using the automatic peak detection tool in Masslynx (Waters, US; see <strong>Figure 1B</strong> in the paper associated with this study), and converted to .<strong>mzXML</strong> in <strong>msconvert[1]</strong>, applying the scan event filter to isolate function 1 which contained the parent ions (see <strong>Figure 1C</strong> in the paper associated with this study). The resulting <strong>.mzXML</strong> files were imported into <strong>R</strong> for further processing and analysis using the package <strong>xcms[2][3]</strong>. The <strong>centWave algorithm[4]</strong> was used for peak picking, and the <strong>Obiwarp method[5]</strong> was used for alignment of retention times. Peaks were then matched across samples to produce mass features (i.e., correspondence), and for samples in which any feature was not detected, peaks were filled by integrating the area under the curve within the region defined from other samples (see <strong>Figure 1D</strong> in the paper associated with this study).</p><p><br></p><p>The preprocessing steps converted raw spectra into tables of features with abundances for each sample. The <strong>R</strong> package <strong>CAMERA[6]</strong> was then used to annotate putative isotopes and adducts, and group features according to peak shape (see <strong>Figure 1E</strong> in the paper associated with this study). First, features were roughly grouped according to retention time and full width at half max (fwhm). Features were then screened to annotate isotopes (<strong>[M+1]</strong>, <strong>[M+2]</strong>, and <strong>[M+3]</strong>) and adducts (<strong>M+H</strong>, <strong>M+Na</strong>, and <strong>M+K</strong>). Lastly, features were finely grouped into pseudospectra according to peak shape using a minimum correlation threshold of 0.75. Annotating and grouping features from the same parent compound allowed removal of all but 1 feature representative of that parent compound, and this was useful for reducing data complexity and redundancy for subsequent data analyses. Within each pseudospectra, features were removed if they were isotopes or lower intensity variants of adduct pairs/triads. This semi-conservative approach eliminated features that were most likely to be redundant, while minimizing the loss of novel features.</p><p><br></p><p>Features were further filtered to remove all but the most ecologically relevant. First, any features detected in experimental controls or solvent blanks were removed, as these represented likely contaminants or impurities from solvents, glassware, or instruments. Also removed were uncommon features, defined here as those not detected in any samples (incurrent or excurrent) of 1 or more species. This left 'common' features, or those that were detected in at least 1 sample (incurrent or excurrent) of at least 1 individual of each species (see <strong>Figure 1F</strong> in the paper associated with this study).</p><p><br></p><p>Raw data from 2018 samples comprised a total of 12,801 features, reduced to 10,595 features after removal of adduct variants and isotopologues. Removal of contaminants and uncommon features left 2,188 features in 2018 sample sets, and data analyses proceeded using these remaining features. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Chambers MC, Maclean B, Burke R, Amodei D, Ruderman DL, Neumann S, Gatto L et al.

                        "description": "<p>Multivariate analyses were conducted on half-minimum imputed, normalized, and range-scaled data using the R package muma<strong>[1]</strong> (see <strong>Figure 1G</strong> in the paper associated with this study). First, principle component analysis (<strong>PCA</strong>) was used as an unsupervised check for In/Ex groupings within and among species and species groups (<strong>HMA/LMA</strong>). A <strong>PCA</strong> that shows grouping is an important prerequisite for supervised analyses, such as orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis (<strong>OPLS-DA</strong>), where the model uses known experimental groupings to refit sample scores and maximize experimental variation along one <strong>PC[2]</strong>. For the <strong>PCA</strong> biplots with clear In/Ex groupings, analyses proceeded with <strong>OPLS-DA</strong> in order to determine which features had the greatest influence on In/Ex differences. Univariate analyses were also conducted on half-minimum imputed, normalized, and log2 transformed data (see <strong>Figure 1H</strong> in the paper associated with this study). In/Ex differences in the abundance of single features were assessed for statistical significance (p &lt; 0.05) using the univariate function in <strong>muma</strong>, which first tests for normality using a <strong>Shapiro-Wilk test</strong>, then computes either a <strong>Welch's t-tes</strong>t or <strong>non-parametric Wilcoxon-Mann Whitney U test</strong>, before correcting for multiple testing using the <strong>Benjamini-Hochberg method[1]</strong>. A feature list was then exported, and this list contained unique IDs, m/z, retention times, and significance (from univariate analyses) of all features (see <strong>Figure 1I</strong> in the paper associated with this study).</p><p><br></p><p>Fragmentation spectra were generated via componentization of MSE data in UNIFI Scientific Information System (Waters, US; see <strong>Figure 1J</strong> in the paper associated with this study). MSE data comprised full-scan data in low and high energy ranges, and the proprietary algorithm within UNIFI resolved individual components from these scans by matching low energy peaks (precursor ions) to putative high energy fragments at the same retention time and removing interfering ions<strong>[3]</strong>. The feature lists containing m/z and retention times were used as targets for matching with candidate components in UNIFI. UNIFI was also used to screen matched components against theoretical isotope distributions corresponding to halogenated ions (chlorine or bromine); feature components were classified as halogenated at a confidence level of 90% or greater.</p><p><br></p><p>Components matching significant and high intensity (detector counts &gt;5,000) features were exported from UNIFI as .<strong>csv</strong> files of m/z and intensity values of peaks from low and high energy fragmentation spectra, for analysis in <strong>SIRIUS 4[4]</strong>. Within <strong>SIRIUS</strong> is the submodule <strong>CANOPUS (Class Assignment aNd Ontology Prediction Using mass Spectrometry)</strong>, which can predict compound classes from fragmentation spectra even in the absence of structural reference data or MS/MS training data<strong>[5]</strong>. For each feature, .csvs were converted to .mgfs for the 3 samples with the most intense peak of the parent ion (see <strong>Figure 1K</strong> in the paper associated with this study), imported into the <strong>SIRIUS</strong> GUI, and run using the following sub-modules and settings: <strong>SIRIUS</strong> (10 ppm deviation, C H N O P Cl Br allowed elements, 10 candidates), <strong>CSI:FingerID</strong> (all included databases), <strong>CANOPUS</strong> selected (see <strong>Figure 1L</strong> in the paper associated with this study). For each feature, <strong>SIRIUS</strong> scored 10 molecular formula candidates based on similarities to isotope patterns and fragmentation trees<strong>[6][7]</strong>. For each candidate, <strong>CANOPUS</strong> scores were assigned to 1,270 chemical classes spanning 11 levels of the hierarchical <strong>ClassyFire</strong> chemontology<strong>[8]</strong>. <strong>CANOPUS</strong> scores are provided by a deep neural network (<strong>DNN</strong>) trained on molecular fingerprints of over a million compound structures. The input of the <strong>DNN</strong> is the molecular fingerprint predicted by <strong>CSI:FingerID</strong>, which uses a support vector machine that is trained on MS/MS spectra of over 20,000 compounds and uses the predicted fragmentation tree as input<strong>[9]-[11]</strong>. We analyzed <strong>SIRIUS</strong> outputs and <strong>CANOPUS</strong> scores in <strong>R</strong>, with a series of simple rules that first picked the best molecular formula candidate, and then the highest scoring chemical class of that candidate (see <strong>Figure 1M</strong> in the paper associated with this study). For each feature, the best candidate was defined as that with the highest score in 2 out of the 3 samples. Classification then proceeded for that candidate using the <strong>CANOPUS</strong> scores from the sample with the most intense peak of the parent ion. From this set of 1,270 scores, the top subclass classification was chosen based on which scored highest for subclass, class, and superclass, to resemble how 'main classes' are assigned in the <strong>CANOPUS</strong> tab on the <strong>SIRIUS</strong> GUI, and ensuring scores &gt;0.5. We compiled these putative classifications to investigate DOM composition, and compare overall DOM to the fraction of DOM that was significantly depleted by the sponge (see <strong>Figure 1N</strong> in the paper associated with this study).</p><p><br></p><p>Metabolites were not given chemical assignments (either putative or unequivocal) but were instead classified according to details in the data analyses below, and based on: statistical significance whether they were significantly excurrent -depleted or -enriched by <strong>HMA</strong> species <em>A. tubulata</em> and <em>X. muta</em>; status as halogenated, determined from comparison to isotopic distributions in UNIFI chemical classifications from <strong>CANOPUS[5]</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Gaude E, Chignola F, Spiliotopoulos D, Spitaleri A, Ghitti M, Garcia-Manteiga JM, Musco SM, Musco G.
