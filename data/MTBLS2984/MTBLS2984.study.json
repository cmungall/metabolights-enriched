                "description": "<p>Tempe is a traditional fermented soybean food product that is rich in proteins. For centuries, the tempe production method has remained unchanged; however, modification of the tempe production process may improve its nutritional quality. In this study, we introduced and optimized ultrasound treatment via sonication to tempe production processes and measured its physical characteristics (moisture content, color and texture) and metabolite profile. Based on our results, 30 min sonication at 10 \u00b0C was the best treatment to increase the amino acid content in tempe when compared to the control. There were no differences in terms of the texture and color intensity between the optimized sonicated and control tempe. However, the moisture content was significantly increased in the optimized sonicated tempe compared to that in the control. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report the use of sonication for increasing the total amino acid content in tempe.</p>",

For quality control (QC) samples, 200 \u00b5L from all sample replicates and blank samples (samples that contained the same solvents, chemicals and consumables, and underwent the same extraction procedure, but without any tempe) were pooled and transferred to 1.5 mL microtubes.

The hydrolyzed sample was then incubated in a shaker incubator at 30 \u00b0C for 90 min at 1200 rpm.
