                "description": "The amount of inorganic carbon represents one of the main environmental factors determining productivity of photoautotrophic organisms. Using the model cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, we performed a first metabolome study with cyanobacterial cells shifted from high CO2 (5% in air) into conditions of low CO2 (LC; ambient air with 0.035% CO2). Using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, 74 metabolites were reproducibly identified under different growth conditions. Shifting wild-type cells into LC conditions resulted in a global metabolic reprogramming and involved increases of, for example, 2-oxoglutarate (2OG) and phosphoenolpyruvate, and reductions of, for example, sucrose and fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. A decrease in Calvin-Benson cycle activity and increased usage of associated carbon cycling routes, including photorespiratory metabolism, was indicated by synergistic accumulation of the fumarate, malate, and 2-phosphoglycolate pools and a transient increase of 3-phosphoglycerate. The unexpected accumulation of 2OG with a concomitant decrease of glutamine pointed toward reduced nitrogen availability when cells are confronted with LC. Despite the increase in 2OG and low amino acid pools, we found a complete dephosphorylation of the PII regulatory protein at LC characteristic for nitrogen-replete conditions. Moreover, mutants with defined blocks in the photorespiratory metabolism leading to the accumulation of glycolate and glycine, respectively, exhibited features of LC-treated wild-type cells such as the changed 2OG to glutamine ratio and PII phosphorylation state already under high CO2 conditions. Thus, metabolome profiling demonstrated that acclimation to LC involves coordinated changes of carbon and interacting nitrogen metabolism. We hypothesize that Synechocystis has a temporal lag of acclimating carbon versus nitrogen metabolism with carbon leading.",

The generation and characterization of the mutants \u0394glcD, bearing a defect in the GlcD coding gene sll0404, and \u0394gcvT, bearing a defect in gene sll0171 coding for the T-protein subunit of the Gly decarboxylase complex, have been described elsewhere [1][2]. For all experiments, axenic cultures of the cyanobacteria were grown photoautotrophically in batch cultures using 3 cm glass vessels with 5 mm glass tubes for aeration (bubbling flow rate was 5 ml/min) and 29 \u00b0C growth temperature under continuous illumination of 130 \u00b5mol photons s-1 m-2 (warm light, Osram L58 W32/3). For shift experiments, cells were precultivated with air enriched by 5% CO2 (HC) in BG11 medium [3], pH 7.0. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in fresh BG11 at an optical density at 750 nm (OD750) of 0.8. After 1 h cultivation under HC conditions, Ci limitation was set by transferring those exponentially growing cultures to bubbling with ambient air containing 0.035% CO2 (LC). To prove PII protein phosphorylation, cells were shifted to HC and LC conditions in BG11 medium without combined N (replacing NaNO3 by equimolar amounts of NaCl) and nitrate-containing standard BG11, respectively. Growth was monitored by measurements of the OD750. Cultivation of mutants was performed at 50 \u00b5g/ml kanamycin or 20 \u00b5g/ml spectinomycin. Contamination by heterotrophic bacteria was checked by spreading 0.2 ml of culture on Luria-Bertani plates.

The cell pellets on the filters were put into 2 ml Eppendorf tubes and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 \u00b0C. Time until metabolic inactivation by freezing was about 20 s. Thus, cells were separated from the bulk medium, but minor negligible contaminations of secreted metabolites may still have been present.\n</p>\nMetabolites were extracted from the deep frozen cells by a premixture of 300 \u00b5l methanol (final concentration approximately 80%), 30 \u00b5l nonadeconoic acid methylester (2 mg/ml chloroform), 30 \u00b5l of ribitol (0.2 mg/ml), and D4-2,3,3,3-Ala (1 mg/ml, standards in methanol). Each sample was mixed thoroughly at least 1 min for complete suspension, agitated 15 min at 70 \u00b0C, brought to room temperature mixed with 200 \u00b5l chloroform, and agitated again 5 min at 37 \u00b0C. Finally, phase separation was induced by 400 \u00b5l distilled water and the upper polar fraction retrieved by 5 min centrifugation at 14,000 rpm using an Eppendorf 5417 microcentrifuge. A total volume of 320 \u00b5l was concentrated and dried in 1.5 ml microtubes by 12 to 18 h of vacuum centrifugation.\n</p>\nThe chemical derivatization, namely methoxyamination and subsequent trimethylsilylation, was performed manually [1].\n</p>\nRef: </br>\n[1]  Fiehn O, Kopka J, D\u00f6rmann P, Altmann T, Trethewey RN, Willmitzer L (2000) Metabolite profiling for plant functional genomics.

Purge time is 1 min at 20 ml/min flow. The flow rate is kept constant with electronic pressure control enabled. Optionally and especially recommended in cases of high metabolite concentrations, injection is performed in split mode with the split ratio adjusted 1:25. As a rule of thumb, split injection may be prone to discrimination of high-boiling metabolic components, whereas splitless injection may, in rare cases, result in peak shape artifacts for low-boiling components. These artifacts occur in few chromatograms and result in different degrees of peak splitting and shoulder formation. For suppression of this peak shape artifact either inject at decreased flow or apply a 2 min pressure pulse at 110 psi during injection. However, a robust suppression of this artifact for all biological samples can currently not be recommended.\n</p>\nThe temperature program starts in isothermal mode set to 1 min at 70 \u00b0C. The isothermal step is followed by a 9 \u00b0C/min ramp to 350 \u00b0C. The final temperature is kept constant for 5 min. Cooling is performed as fast as instrument specifications allow. The transfer line temperature is set to 250 \u00b0C and matches ion source conditions.\n</p>\nThe n-alkanes used to calculate are retention time index were as follows: decane, dodecane, pentadecane, octadecane, nonadecane, docosane, octacosane, dotriacontane, hexatriacontane.

                        "description": "A complete matrix of peak heights representing arbitrary mass spectral ion currents of all available mass features was used for initial numerical analysis. Peak heights were corrected by the amount of cells using OD750 and to the recovered amount of the internal standard, ribitol, to yield normalized responses. These normalized responses were used to calculate response ratios, subsequently also called relative content, compared to the respective choice of control condition. Identification of metabolite-specific mass fragments from this data matrix was manually supervised. Compounds were identified using the TargetFinder plug-in of TagFinder-Software and a reference library of mass spectra and retention indices from the collection of the Golm Metabolome Database (http://csbdb.mpimp-golm.mpg.de/csbdb/gmd/home/gmd_sm.html; [1]). Thresholds for automated mass spectral prematching were match factor >650 and retention indices deviation <1.0%. Identifications were confirmed manually by co-chromatography of defined reference mixtures [2]. The full resulting data set of identified metabolites and respective normalized responses may be found within Supplemental Table S1.\n</p>\nGln determination using the above GC-TOF-MS is impaired due to chemical conversion of Gln into pyroglutamate. Residual Gln can still be used for relative quantification but may be close to detection limits, while the use of pyroglutamate gives nonselective information on the sum of Gln and pyroglutamate and may contain trace contributions from Glu. For this reason, free amino acids were extracted from frozen cyanobacterial cell pellets with 80% ethanol at 65\u00b0C for 3 h. After centrifugation, the supernatants were dried by lyophilization and redissolved in 8 mm Na2HPO4, pH 6.8, containing 2.5% tetrahydrofurane. Individual amino acids were assayed after derivatization with o-phthaldialdehyde and analyzed by HPLC as previously described [3].\n</p>\nData management, data transformation, and basic calculations were performed using Microsoft Office Excel 2003 options. The TM4 multi-experiment viewer [4] and the MetaGeneAlyse Web service [5] were employed for visual and statistical data assessment, e.g. ICA, one- and two-way ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis, or Mack-Skillings tests.\nRef: </br>\n[1] Kopka J, Schauer N, Krueger S, Birkemeyer C, Usadel B, Bergmueller E, Doermann P, Weckwerth W, Gibon Y, Stitt M, et al (2005) GMD@CSB.DB: the Golm Metabolome Database.
