                "description": "Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are one of the most common bacterial infections in humans, with ~400 million cases across the globe each year. Uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) is the major cause of UTI and increasingly associated with antibiotic resistance. This scenario has been worsened by the emergence and spread of pandemic UPEC sequence type 131 (ST131), a multidrug-resistant clone associated with extraordinarily high rates of infection. Here, we employed transposon-directed insertion site sequencing in combination with metabolomic profiling to identify genes and biochemical pathways required for growth and survival of the UPEC ST131 reference strain EC958 in human urine (HU). We identified 24 UPEC genes required for growth in HU, which mapped to diverse pathways involving small peptide, amino acid and nucleotide metabolism, the stringent response pathway, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) biosynthesis. We also discovered a role for UPEC resistance to fluoride during growth in HU, most likely associated with fluoridation of drinking water. Complementary NMR-based metabolomics identified changes in a range of HU metabolites following UPEC growth, the most pronounced being L-lactate, which was utilized as a carbon source via the L-lactate dehydrogenase LldD. Using a mouse UTI model with mixed competitive infection experiments, we demonstrated a role for nucleotide metabolism and the stringent response in UPEC colonization of the mouse bladder. Together, our application of multiple omics technologies combined with different infection-relevant settings has uncovered new factors required for UPEC growth in HU, thus enhancing our understanding of this pivotal step in the UPEC infection pathway.",
