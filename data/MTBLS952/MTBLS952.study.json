                "description": "Major depressive disorder (MDD), also known as depression, is a state characterized by low mood and aversion to activity. Platycodins Folium (PF) is the dried leaf of Platycodon grandiflorum, with anti-inflammatory and antioxidative activities. Our previous research suggested that PF was rich in flavonoids, phenols, organic acids, triterpenoid saponins, coumarins and terpenoids. This study aimed to investigate the antidepressant effect of PF using lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced depressive mice. Several behavior tests (sucrose preference test (SPT), forced swimming test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST)) and biochemical parameters (IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 and SOD levels) were used to evaluate the antidepressive effect of PF on LPS-induced depression model. Furthermore, a UPLC-Q/TOF-MS-based metabolomics approach was applied to explore the latent mechanism of PF in attenuating depression. As a result, a total of 21 and 11 metabolites that potentially contribute to MDD progress and PF treatment were identified in serum and hippocampus, respectively. The analysis of metabolic pathways revealed that lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, energy metabolism, arachidonic acid metabolism, glutathione metabolism and inositol phosphate metabolism were disturbed in a model of mice undergoing MDD and PF treatment. These results help us to understand the pathogenesis of depression in depth, and to discover targets for clinical diagnosis and treatment. They also provide the possibility of developing PF into an anti-depressantive agent.",

All of the mice had free access to standard laboratory food and water and were maintained under standardized laboratory conditions (temperature 21\u201323 \u00b0C, relative humidity 40\u201360%, 12 h light/dark cycle, with the light cycle beginning at 7:00 a.m.) for 7 days, before the experiment.</p><p><br></p><p>After 1 week of acclimatization, the mice were randomly divided into normal control group (N), lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced model group (M) and LPS + Platycodins Folium (PF) (400 mg/kg/day) group (HPF). Platycodins Folium is a dried leaf of Platycodon grandiflorum, with anti-inflammatory and antioxidative activities. M group was administered a normal saline solution (0.9% NaCl aqueous) while the PF group was administered PF extract. The doses were determined based on the unpublished acute toxicity test and dose screening experiment. All the mice were administered their respective solutions once daily (i.g. 10 ml/kg) for 7 consecutive days. On the 7th day, all mice received a single LPS (0.83 mg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle (0.9% NaCl aqueous) at 0.5 h after the last drug treatment. LPS was dissolved in isotonic saline solution that was sterile and endotoxin-free. After fasting for 8 h, behavioral evaluation, including body weight (BW), sucrose preference test (SPT), tail suspension test (TST) and forced swimming test (FST) was performed on the 8th day (LPS stimulation after 24 h). During the test, the mice had free access to water. The mice were permitted to rest for 1h between the TST and FST.</p><p><br></p><p>Thereafter, 1 ml of blood was collected from the retroorbital plexus immediately after the FST, then clotted at 4 \u00b0C for 1 h and centrifuged at 3500 x g for 15 min at 4 \u00b0C to obtain the serum. The brains were rapidly isolated on ice after the blood collection, followed by immediately taking the hippocampus samples. Then the serum and hippocampus were quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored at -80 \u00b0C. In order to investigate the anti-depressive effect of PF, the serum and hippocampal tissues from all of the groups were prepared for pharmacological analysis. While aiming at finding the potential biomarkers among model group, most effective dose group and normal group, the serum and hippocampal tissue in N, M and HPF group were also used for metabolomics analysis.</p><p><br></p><p>PF was collected from Jilin Province, Northeastern China and identified by Professor Ping-Ya Li (School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Jilin University). PF was air-dried, grinded and sieved (40 mesh) to obtain a homogenous powder. Then the powder was extracted thrice with 70% methanol at 80 \u00b0C (3 h each time). After being filtered, the extracted solution was combined, concentrated and evaporated to obtain the PF extract. The chemical components of PF were elucidated in a previous study<strong>[1]</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Wang C, Zhang N, Wang Z, et al.

The mass spectrum was obtained from 100 to 1200 Da in the MSE mode. There was only one condition that was different from the positive mode compared with the negative mode: the capillary voltage was 2.2 kV. The ramp collision energy of the high energy function was 20\u201340 V, while that of the low energy function was 6 V. During a single LC run, data acquisition was conducted through a mass spectrometer by quickly switching from a low-collision energy scan to a high-collision energy scan. Leucine encephalin with a constant flow of 10 \u03bcl/min was used as an external reference of the Lock Spray. The MS data scanning format was an MSE continuum.</p>",

Clear metabolites separation of normal control group (N), LPS-induced model group (M) and high-dose PF group (HPF) could be observed&nbsp;through the PCA analysis in both serum and hippocampus samples in ESI+ and ESI-. HPF group was located between M group and N group tending to N group, which revealed that there was alteration in specific biomarkers in the model and LPS-induced metabolic disturbances were significantly regulated by PF treatment. Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA), a supervised method of pattern recognition, could make the general metabolic variation between M and HPF groups visualized and depicted. Each spot in the OPLS-DA score plot is representative for a sample. From the permutations plots, all blue Q2-values to the left were lower than the original points to the right, suggesting the validity of the original models. The S-plots were generated to identify the potential metabolites. The further away from the origin, the more significantly the spots in S-plots contribute to the clustering of the M and HPF groups. Only if the variable importance in the projection (VIP) value was above 1.0 and the p-value was below 0.05, the metabolites could be considered as potential biomarkers. Then, some biochemical databases, including HMDB (<a href='http://www. hmdb.ca/' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>http://www. hmdb.ca/</a>), METLIN (<a href='http://metlin.scripps.edu/' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>http://metlin.scripps.edu/</a>), KEGG (<a href='http://www.kegg.com/' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>http://www.kegg.com/</a>) and Metabo-Analyst (<a href='http://www. metaboanalyst.ca/' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>http://www. metaboanalyst.ca/</a>), were used to further identify potential biomarkers. Based on the data of MetaboAnalyst, the metabolic pathways with the impact-value threshold above 0.10 were selected as the most potential ones. Then the probable molecular formulas of the biomarkers were calculated by high-accuracy quasi-molecular ion, and the mass tolerance was within \u00b110 ppm. The MS/MS fragments of the matched components that were acquired from 10 to 40 eV were compared with the fragments in Metlin. Potential biomarkers were eventually confirmed via comparison with reference standards or MS/MS fragments.</p>",
