Gut microbiota and serum metabolome were analyzed using shotgun metagenomics and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS). 41 controls were included.</p><p><strong>RESULTS:</strong> The gut microbiota in B-CS patients showed greater abundance of Campylobacter and lower Saccharomyces, Deinococcus and Thiomonas (P &lt; 0.05). 13 differential metabolites such as taurocholate and (R)\u22123\u2212Hydroxybutyric acid were identified in B-CS patients. The random forest (RF) models showed that serum metabolome could effectively identify B-CS from healthy controls and RF-metabolomics exhibited perfect discrimination (AUC = 100%, 95% CI: 100% \u2013 100%), which was significantly higher than that achieved by RF-metagenomics (AUC =58.48%, 95% CI: 38.46% \u2013 78.5%). The results of association analysis showed that Campylobacter concisus and taurocholate were significantly positively correlated in B-CS patients with clinical manifestations (P &lt; 0.05). Moreover, Actinobacteria was significantly increased in untreated B-CS patients vs. treated B-CS patients (P &lt; 0.05). Campylobacter and Veillonella were significantly increased in treated B-CS patients vs. health controls (P &lt; 0.05). In addition, Fewer discrepant microbes were found between treated and untreated groups for the patients without clinical manifestation.</p><p><strong>CONCLUSIONS:</strong> We identified major alterations in the gut microbiota and serum metabolome of B-CS patients. Alterations in fecal metagenomics and serum metabolomics guided management strategies for the patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome.</p>",

The patients and healthy controls did not use antibiotics in the past 3 months, and did not take probiotic preparations or dietary yoghurt in 1 month. In particular, none of the subjects could suffer from any disease affecting the intestinal microorganisms, including: obesity, hypertension, diabetes, intestinal diseases, and long-term diarrhoea and constipation. All of our healthy controls were family members who shared their diet and living environment with B-CS patients. The blood of all individuals was collected in a 5 ml EP tube, then centrifuged at 4,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C to extract the serum to a new EP tube, and stored at -80 \u00b0C for further detection.</p>",
