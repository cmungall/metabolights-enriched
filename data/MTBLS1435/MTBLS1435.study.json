                "description": "<h4><strong>BACKGROUND: </strong>Palmar osteochondral disease (POD) is a common cause of lameness in competition horses. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most sensitive diagnostic modality currently available, however it may not be financially or logistically practical for routine screening of POD. There is increasing interest in the use of metabolomics for diagnosis prior to progression to irreversible damage.</h4><h4><strong>OBJECTIVES: </strong>To determine metabolite levels in synovial fluid (SF) of horses with a clinical diagnosis of POD based on diagnostic analgesia and MRI, with the hypothesis that metabolomic profiles differ between diseased and healthy joints.</h4><h4><strong>STUDY DESIGN:</strong> Prospective clinical study.</h4><h4><strong>METHODS: </strong>Synovial fluid was collected from metacarpo/tarsophalangeal joints (MC/TPJ) of 29 horses (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;51 joints), including 14 controls (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;26) and 15 cases (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;25), the latter with lameness localised to the MC/TPJ and MR changes consistent with POD (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;23). Spectra were produced using <sup>1</sup> H-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and analysed.</h4><h4><strong>RESULTS: </strong>Twenty-five metabolites were recognised associated with various biosynthetic and degradation pathways. The metabolite abundances within the controls demonstrated increased variability compared with the clinical group. The low level of variance between the spectra of the two groups was explained by five principal components. Cross-validation of the cohort demonstrated modest separation of predictive power (R<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.67; Q<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.34). Although statistical significance was not achieved, the most influential metabolites were glucose and lactate.</h4><h4><strong>MAIN LIMITATIONS:</strong> The modest sample size and variation in signalment, background and presenting condition of the controls may have impacted the discriminative power of the constructed models. The lack of matched controls, differences in time of fluid collection and freezing times may have also reduced accuracy when representing metabolite profiles.</h4><h4><strong>CONCLUSIONS:</strong> This study identified and quantified metabolites present in MC/TPJ SF of clinical cases with POD.</h4>",

Criteria for inclusion were: <strong>1)</strong> lameness localised to the MC/TPJ based on regional or intra-articular analgesia; <strong>2)</strong> absence of other causative lesions within the joint on comprehensive radiographic examination; <strong>3)</strong> MRI changes consistent with those described for POD<strong>[1]</strong>. Inclusion criteria for control horses were: <strong>1)</strong> clinical presentation for unrelated conditions or lameness that did not improve upon intra-articular analgesia of the MC/TPJ; <strong>2)</strong> absence of pathology on subsequent MRI of the MC/TPJ. Some of the control cases were subjected to euthanasia for humane reasons due to the initial presenting conditions.</p><p><br></p><p>Synovial fluid was aspirated from the affected MC/TPJ at the time of intra-articular analgesia or medication or within 10 min of euthanasia of those subjected to euthanasia. 1 ml of SF was placed into uncoated 1.5 ml collection tubes and the sample centrifuged at 1600 x g for 5 min at room temperature to remove particulate matter prior to transfer of the cell-free supernatant into a clean collection tube.

This included consistent line-widths, a flat baseline and water suppression to a signal of less than 0.4 ppm wide. Spectra that met the criteria were divided into regions ('buckets') and metabolites annotated from <strong>Chenomx NMR 330-mammalian metabolite library</strong>. Each bucket was labelled with the metabolite peak identity from the pattern file. Buckets attributed to ethanol were omitted for multivariate analysis. Identities were confirmed by a combination of <strong>1H 1D-NMR</strong> and, where possible, in-house <strong>two-dimensional (2D) 1H13C Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence NMR standards</strong>. As not all 1H NMR spectra were acquired at the same time, spectra were assessed for batch effect between runs using <strong>iconNMR</strong> and <strong>MetaboAnalyst</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Data analysis:</strong></p><p>The spectra were divided into 2 groups (POD and control) and analysed using <strong>MetaboAnalyst 4</strong>. The 'bucketed' data were normalised to the median to improve statistical reliability and reduce any systemic bias arising from sampling inconsistencies. Pareto-scaling was carried out for multivariate analysis. Univariate analysis was performed using t- tests with application of a <strong>False-Discovery Rate (FDR)</strong> adjusted P-value of 0.05. Multivariate analysis included unsupervised <strong>Principal Component Analysis (PCA)</strong> and <strong>Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA)</strong> to determine the optimal number of components for the model. Statistical significance was set at P\u22640.05 following correction for multiple testing using the <strong>Benjamini-Hochberg FDR method</strong>. <strong>Quantile</strong> and <strong>PCA</strong> plots were generated by standard analytical routines using the software package '<strong>R</strong>'.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Sumner LW, Amberg A, Barrett D, Beale MH, Beger R, Daykin CA, Fan TW, Fiehn O et al.
