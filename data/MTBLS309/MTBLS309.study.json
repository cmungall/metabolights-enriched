                "description": "Anthropogenic CO2 presently at 400 ppm is expected to reach 550 ppm in 2050, an increment expected to affect plant growth and productivity. Paired stomatal guard cells (GCs) are the gate-way for water, CO2, and pathogen, while mesophyll cells (MCs) represent the bulk cell-type of green leaves mainly for photosynthesis. We used the two different cell types, i.e., GCs and MCs from canola (Brassica napus) to profile metabolomic changes upon increased CO2 through supplementation with bicarbonate (HCO3-). Two metabolomics platforms enabled quantification of 268 metabolites in a time-course study to reveal short-term responses. The HCO3- responsive metabolomes of the cell types differed in their responsiveness. The MCs demonstrated increased amino acids, phenylpropanoids, redox metabolites, auxins and cytokinins, all of which were decreased in GCs in response to HCO3-. In addition, the GCs showed differential increases of primary C-metabolites, N-metabolites (e.g., purines and amino acids), and defense-responsive pathways (e.g., alkaloids, phenolics, and flavonoids) as compared to the MCs, indicating differential C/N homeostasis in the cell-types. The metabolomics results provide insights into plant responses and crop productivity under future climatic changes where elevated CO2 conditions are to take center-stage.",

Global obtained from Sval\u00f6v Weibull AB (Sval\u00f6v, Sweden) were germinated in Metro-Mix 500 potting mixture (The Scotts Co., Marysville, OH, USA), and grown in growth chambers under a photosynthetic flux of 160 \u00b5mol photons/m^2/s with a photoperiod of 10 h at 24 \u00b0C in light and 20 \u00b0C in dark. Fully expanded leaves from seven week-old plants were used for GCs and MCs enrichment experiments. The metabolite standards were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Stock solutions of the 330 compounds were dissolved in appropriate solvents, and prepared as a dilution series in water. The metabolite standards used for the HPLC-MRM-MS library can be found in Table S1 in the paper associated with this study. These solutions were either used immediately or stored in -80 \u00b0C. Serially diluted stock standard metabolite solutions, ranging in concentration of 0.1\u2013100 pmol/\u00b5l were used to verify the linear response in the mass spectrometer.\n</p>\n15 g of leaves with main veins removed were blended four times for 15 s each in cold distilled water using a 14-speed Osterizer blender (Oster Inc., Boca Raton, FL). The blended mixture was washed with cold distilled water on a 100 \u00b5m Nylon mesh until the flow through was clear of MCs, debris, and plastids. These epidermal peels were then subjected to enzymatic digestion (0.7% Calbiochem cellulysin, 0.025% Macerozyme R10, 0.1% PVP 40, 0.25% BSA) for 50 min in a shaking water bath at 140 rpm in dark. The digest was collected on a nylon mesh (100 \u00b5m) and was repeatedly washed using 750 ml of Basic solution (560 mM sorbitol, 5 mM MES, 0.5 mM CaCl2, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 10 \u00b5M KH2PO4, pH 5.5) to remove broken epidermal (pavement) cells. The enriched GCs were then incubated in stomata opening buffer (50 \u00b5M CaCl2, 10 mM KCl, 10 mM MES-KOH, pH 6.2) prepared in Basic solution for an hour in the growth chamber under plant growth conditions. The GC preparations were freshly used.\n</p>\nMCs were isolated as previously described[1] except that the sucrose concentration was 0.7 M. The GCs and MCs were aliquoted in appropriate volumes, and NaHCO3 was added to a final concentration of 1 mM. Cells were incubated for 0, 5, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min on a shaker, and four replicates were generated for each data point. After treatment, the GCs and MCs were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored in -80 \u00b0C until metabolite extraction.\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Chen S, Halkier BA.

The HPLC (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) used an autosampler (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) to inject the samples automatically. A C18-reverse phase (Gemini 5\u00b5; 150 x 2.0 mm, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA) analytical column was used with a C18 guard cartridge. The mobile phase consisted of two solvents, i.e., 0.1% formic acid in H2O (solvent A) and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile (solvent B). The HPLC method was run with the following gradient program, i.e., 1:99, v/v, at 0 min; 1:99, v/v, at 0.2 min; 99.5:0.5, v/v at 31 min; 99.5:0.5, v/v at 34 min; 1:99, v/v, at 34.2 min; 1:99 at 60 min at room temperature.\n</p>\nMultiple blank solutions were prepared by adding only extraction solvent (buffer) and distilled water, respectively, whereas pooled samples were used as quality control (QC) runs for monitoring the chromatography and mass spectrometer conditions.\n</p>\nGC-MS:</br>\n1 \u00b5l of the derivatized sample was injected in splitless mode into a GC-MS system consisting of an autosampler and a TSQ8000 Triple Quadrupole (Thermo Scientific Inc., San Jose, CA, USA) or a 5977A Series GC/MSD (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped with an electron impact (EI) ionization source. Injection of the sample was performed at 250 \u00b0C with helium as a carrier gas and flow set to 2 ml/min. GC was performed using a TR-5MS or HP-5MS capillary column (30 m x 0.25 mm x 0.25 \u00b5m). The temperature program started isothermal at 70 \u00b0C for 1 min followed by a 6 \u00b0C/min ramp to 300 \u00b0C and a final 11 min hold at 300 \u00b0C. The system was then temperature-equilibrated at 70 \u00b0C for 5 min before the next injection.",

The electrospray ionization (ESI) parameters were: curtain gas (CUR) at 30 psi, the ion source (IS) at (+/-) 4500 V, nebulizer gas (GS1) at 50 psi, TIS gas (GS2) at 55 psi and the TIS probe temperature at 350\u00b0C. To optimize analyte sensitivity, individual working solutions having the characteristic MRM transition with the optimal declustering potential (DP), collision energy (CE), cell exit potential (CXP) were selected for individual metabolites. Each transition was performed with a 15\u201340 ms dwell time to get a scan time around 1.2 ms for all the transitions analysed using a method including an enhanced MS scan and an enhanced product ion scan before switching to MRM mode. Essentially, QQQ experiments scans[1] were acquired as MRM experiments where a specific set of MRM transitions were monitored for each run period according to the metabolites eluted within this particular time-frame. We monitored 59 (5.8 min), 40 (9.9 min), 45 (7.9 min), 31 (12.5 min), and 18 (23.8 min) MRM transitions over five periods for the positive ionization mode. For the negative ionization mode, 66 and 11 MRM transitions were recorded for the first and second periods, respectively. Thus, each MRM transition was obtained with a 5-ms dwell time, and the scan mode change was set for 700 ms. The total cycle time was 1\u20131.5 s for the period, which ensured at least 10 points were obtained for each eluted peak.\n</p>\nGC-MS:</br>\nMass spectra were collected on the TSQ8000 Triple Quadrupole (Thermo Scientific Inc., San Jose, CA, USA) and 5977A Series GC/MSD (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) at 20 scans/s with a range of m/z 40\u2013600. The transfer line and the ion source temperatures were set to 250 \u00b0C. A standard alkane mixture (C8-C40) was injected at the beginning and end of the analysis for tentative identification and monitoring shifts in retention indices (RI).\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Chen W, Gong L, Guo Z, Wang W, Zhang H, Liu X, Yu S, Xiong L, Luo J.

Additional peak identification was confirmed by comparing against the NIST Mass Spectral Reference Library (NIST08/2008, National Institute of Standards and Technology, USA). Peak finding and quantification of selective ion traces were accomplished using AMDIS software. As a rule, if a compound had an AMDIS match factor of >60% and a probability score >20% as well as a matching RI to a known compound it was considered \u201cprobable\u201d. Peak areas were normalized by dividing each peak area value by the area of the internal standard for a specific sample, and were further median normalized.
