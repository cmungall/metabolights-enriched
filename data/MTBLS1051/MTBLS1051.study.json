                "description": "Alteration of various metabolites has been linked to type 2 diabetes (T2D) and insulin resistance. However, identifying significant associations between metabolites and tissue-specific phenotypes requires a multi-omics approach. In a cohort of 42 subjects with different levels of glucose tolerance (normal, prediabetes and T2D) matched for age and body mass index, we calculated associations between parameters of whole-body positron emission tomography (PET)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) during hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp and non-targeted metabolomics profiling for subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) and plasma. Plasma metabolomics profiling revealed that hepatic fat content was positively associated with tyrosine, and negatively associated with lysoPC(P-16:0). Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and SAT insulin sensitivity (K<sub>i</sub>), were positively associated with several lysophospholipids, while the opposite applied to branched-chain amino acids. The adipose tissue metabolomics revealed a positive association between non-esterified fatty acids and, VAT and liver K<sub>i</sub>. Bile acids and carnitines in adipose tissue were inversely associated with VAT K<sub>i</sub>. Furthermore, we detected several metabolites that were significantly higher in T2D than normal/prediabetes. In this study we present novel associations between several metabolites from SAT and plasma with the fat fraction, volume and insulin sensitivity of various tissues throughout the body, demonstrating the benefit of an integrative multi-omics approach.",

Control, prediabetes and T2D subjects were matched for age (40\u201370) and BMI (20\u201335), and we aimed to also have a similar sex distribution. The T2D subjects had been diagnosed according to ADA criteria and HbA1c levels were 48\u201361 mmol/mol. They did not manifest diabetic complications and all but one subject took metformin at a stable dose (1666 \u00b1937 mg per day) but no other anti-diabetic medications. Control subjects had glucose levels &lt; 5.6 mmol/l fasting and &lt; 7.8 mmol/l 2 hr after OGTT (venous plasma samples). Pre-diabetes subjects had impaired fasting glucose (IFG); 5.6 \u2013 6.9 mmol/l, and/or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT); 2 hr OGTT \u2265 7.8 mmol/l. Subjects with Type 1 Diabetes, liver dysfunction, renal impairment, alcohol or drug abuse, pregnancy or any serious clinical condition were excluded. Furthermore, subjects were excluded if they reported a weight change exceeding 5 kg during the 12 wks preceding visit or were treated with systemic glucocorticoids or anti-psychotics. The study was approved by the Regional Ethics Re-view Committee in Uppsala (Dnr 2014-313). All subjects gave their informed written consent. Subjects were instructed to fast overnight and not to smoke or exercise at least 10 hr prior to the visit. Baseline fasting blood samples were taken and analyzed (Clinical Chemistry dept., UUH). Next, a SAT sample was taken from the lower abdominal area by needle biopsy. A 2 hr oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) concluded the visit.</p>",
