                "description": "Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular parasite causing severe diseases in immunocompromised individuals and congenitally infected neonates, such as encephalitis and chorioretinitis. This study aimed to determine whether serum metabolic profiling can (i) identify metabolites associated with oocyst-induced T. gondii infection and (ii) detect systemic metabolic differences between T. gondii-infected mice and controls. We performed the first global metabolomics analysis of mice serum challenged with 100 sporulated T. gondii Pru oocysts (Genotype II). Sera from acutely infected mice (11 days post-infection, dpi), chronically infected mice (33 dpi) and control mice were collected and analyzed using LC-MS/MS platform. Following False Discovery Rate filtering, we identified 3871 and 2825 ions in ESI+ or ESI- mode, respectively. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) identified metabolomic profiles that clearly differentiated T. gondii-infected and -uninfected serum samples. Acute infection significantly influenced the serum metabolome. Our results identified common and uniquely perturbed metabolites and pathways. Acutely infected mice showed perturbations in metabolites associated with glycerophospholipid metabolism, biosynthesis of amino acid, and tyrosine metabolism. These findings demonstrated that acute T. gondii infection induces a global perturbation of mice serum metabolome, providing new insights into the mechanisms underlying systemic metabolic changes during early stage of T. gondii infection.",

Mice received sterilized food and water ad libitum. 12 mice were infected orally with ~100 freshly prepared sporulated oocysts via oral gavage with 100 \u00b5L saline solution using 1-ml tuberculin syringes and feeding needles. 6 mock-infected (control) mice received 100 \u00b5L saline alone. All mice were monitored daily for mortality and morbidity throughout the course of infection. At 11 and 33 days post-infection (dpi) with T. gondii oocysts 6 mice were sacrificed. The mock-infected (control) mice were sacrificed along with the 33 DPI group.\n</p>\nThe blood samples from acutely infected (11 dpi), chronically infected (33 dpi) and control mice groups were prepared as previously described[1]. Briefly, blood samples were obtained by retro-orbital bleed into Eppendorf tubes and were allowed to clot for 3 hr followed by centrifugation at 3,000 x g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C. Sera were frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 \u00b0C until use for metabolite extraction.\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Wikoff WR, Anfora AT, Liu J, Schultz PG, Lesley SA, Peters EC, Siuzdak G.

The non-parametric univariate method (two-tailed Wilcoxon rank-sum test) was used to discover the significantly altered metabolites among the infected and healthy control mice. The results were corrected by false discovery rate (FDR) to ensure that metabolite peaks were reproducibly detected. The differential metabolites were selected when the statistically significant threshold of variable importance in the projection (VIP) values obtained from the PLS-DA model were larger than 1.0. Statistically significant differences were tested using Student's t-test, and the corrected P-values (q-value) <0.05 was deemed as statistically significant. Log2 fold change (FC) was used to show how the selected differential metabolites varied between the mice groups. Serum metabolites passing the VIP threshold (VIP > 1) and fold change = 1.2 or = 0.8 were considered as significantly different between the mice groups.\n</p>\nHeatmaps were used to depict the relatively disturbed and unbalanced metabolic signature among T. godnii-infected mice compared to control mice. Heatmaps were generated using the MultiExperiment Viewer (MeV) v. 4.9 software (http://mev.tm4.org/) based on the abundance of the differentially expressed metabolite data (log2-scaled). The online databases of Human Metabolome Database (HMDB; http://www.hmdb.ca) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG; http://www.genome.jp/kegg) were used to check and confirm the putative identity of the differentially expressed metabolites by matching the exact molecular mass data (m/z) of samples with those from the databases. The candidate metabolites were confirmed by MS/MS scans for the characteristic ions and fragmentation patterns of the compound. We performed pathway analysis of the differentially expressed metabolites detected in both ion modes using MetaboAnalyst 3.0. The identified pathways influenced by acute infection compared to controls are presented according to p-values from the pathway enrichment analysis (y-axis) and pathway impact values from pathway topology analysis (x-axis), with the most impacted pathways colored in red color. To gain further insight into the underlying biological mechanisms associated with infection, we performed the impact value and \u2013log (P) along with metabolic pathway analysis (MetPA), the P-value represented the enrichment of certain metabolites in a pathway (P = 0.05 is indicative of significant enrichment).",
