                "description": "Psoriasis is a chronic skin disease that affects multiple systems and can be influenced by immunological, environmental, and genetic factors. The discovery of plasma biomarkers of psoriasis and the regulation of metabolic pathways helps us understand psoriasis and may assist clinicians in the diagnosis and treatment of psoriasis. Here, we used untargeted metabolomics based on high-resolution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to study the changes of metabolites and metabolic pathways in plasma samples of psoriasis. A total of 301 differential metabolites were detected, of which 10 metabolites were possible potential biomarkers, including vitamins, amino acids and lipids. At the same time, KEGG pathway enrichment analysis was performed on all the detected differential metabolites, and it was found that protein digestion and absorption, amino acid metabolism and lipid metabolism may jointly participate in the regulation of pathogenesis of psoriasis. In addition, three proteins ESR1, OPRM1 and HSD11B1 were identified as possible potential topical therapeutic targets for psoriasis by metabolite-protein interaction network analysis. In this study, plasma metabolites were characterized in patients with psoriasis which provided a new understanding of the role of metabolites in psoriasis. It also deepened the understanding of the pathogenesis of psoriasis and proposed new ideas and methods for the auxiliary diagnosis and treatment of the disease.",

Electrospray ionization was used in both negative and positive modes.

The capillary voltage was 2 kV and the sampling cone voltage was set at 30 V. Centroid MSE&nbsp;data acquisition mode was used, full scan mass range was from 50 to 1200 m/z. The MS/MS&nbsp;were obtained using fragmentation energies from 20 to 40 ev&nbsp;and the scan time was 0.2 s. The LE signal was required to be corrected&nbsp;the mass accuracy once every 3 s throughout the data acquisition process. To monitor the stability of the instrument platform, a pooling quality control (QC) sample&nbsp;was injected every 10 samples and all experimental samples injection orders were randomized.&nbsp;</p>",
