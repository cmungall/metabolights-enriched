                "description": "<p><em>Trichosporon asahii</em> is a basidiomycete yeast that is pathogenic to humans and animals, and fluconazole-resistant strains have recently increased. Farnesol secreted by fungi is a factor that causes variations in fluconazole resistance; however, few studies have explored the underlying mechanisms. Therefore, this study aims to delineate the fluconazole resistance mechanisms of <em>T. asahii</em> and explore farnesol\u2019s effects on these processes. A comparative metabolome-transcriptome analysis of untreated fluconazole-sensitive (YAN), fluconazole-resistant (PB) <em>T. asahii</em> strains and 25 \u03bcM farnesol-treated strains (YAN-25 and PB-25, respectively) was performed. The membrane lipid-related genes and metabolites were upregulated in the PB vs YAN and PB-25 vs PB comparisons. Farnesol demonstrated strain-dependent mechanisms underlying fluconazole tolerance between the YAN and PB strains, and upregulated and downregulated efflux pumps in PB-25 and YAN-25 strains, respectively. Membrane lipid-related metabolites were highly correlated with transporter-coding genes. Fluconazole resistance in <em>T. asahii</em> was induced by membrane lipid bio-synthesis activation. Farnesol inhibited fluconazole resistance in the sensitive strain, but enhanced resistance in the resistant strain by upregulating efflux pump genes and membrane lipids. This study offers valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying fungal drug resistance and provides guidance for future research aimed at developing more potent antifungal drugs for clinical use.</p><p><br></p>",

This strain was cultured on Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) containing stepwise increasing concentrations of fluconazole to induce highly resistant strains. The resistant strains were then cultured on fluconazole-free SDA and passaged in turn. After 10 subsequent generations, a stable highly resistant strain was obtained and named PB.</p><p><br></p><p>A 25-\u00b5M farnesol medium was prepared by dissolving farnesol in methanol and then diluting this mixture in yeast extract peptone dextrose (YPD) medium. To systematically investigate which genes in <em>T. asahii</em> could potentially display an altered expression in response to farnesol treatment, YAN and PB strains were exposed to the 25 \u00b5M farnesol medium. Each strain was cultured at 115 x g and 25 \u00b0C for 48 h and reached a density of approximately 1 x 10^3 colony forming units (CFU)/mL. After the farnesol treatment, strains YAN and PB were named YAN-25 and PB-25, respectively. The thalli were collected by centrifugation, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and maintained at -80 \u00b0C.</p>",

Precusor tolerance was set 5 ppm, fragment tolerance was set 10 ppm and retention time (RT) tolerance was set 0.02 min. Internal standard detection parameters were deselected for peak RT alignment, isotopic peaks were excluded for analysis, and noise elimination level was set at 10.00, minimum intensity was set to 15% of base peak intensity. The Excel file was obtained with 3D datasets including m/z, peak RT and peak intensities, and RT-m/z pairs were used as the identifier for each ion. The resulting matrix was further reduced by removing any peaks with missing value (ion intensity = 0) in more than 50% samples. The internal standard was used for data QC (reproducibility). Metabolites were identified by progenesis QI (Waters Corporation, Milford, USA) Data Processing Software, based on public databases such as HMDB (http://www.hmdb.ca), LIPID MAPS (http://www.lipidmaps.org) and self-built databases. The positive and negative data were combined to get a combine data which was imported into R ropls package. Principle component analysis (PCA) and (orthogonal) partial least-squares-discriminant analysis (O)PLS-DA were carried out to visualize the metabolic alterations among experimental groups, after mean centering (Ctr) and Pareto variance (Par) scaling, respectively. The Hotelling\u2019s T2 region, shown as an ellipse in score plots of the models, defines the 95% confidence interval of the modeled variation. Variable importance in the projection (VIP) ranks the overall contribution of each variable to the OPLS-DA model, and those variables with VIP &gt; 1 are considered relevant for group discrimination. In this study, the default 7-round cross-validation was applied with 1/7 of the samples being excluded from the mathematical model in each round, in order to guard against overfitting. The differential metabolites were selected on the basis of the combination of a statistically significant threshold of variable influence on projection (VIP) values obtained from the OPLS- DA model and p values from a two-tailed Student\u2019s t test on the normalized peak areas, where metabolites with VIP \u2265 1.0 and p values (FDR) &lt; 0.05 were considered as differential metabolites.</p>",
