                "description": "The mite Varroa destructor is currently the greatest threat to apiculture as it is causing a global decrease in honey bee colonies. However, it rarely causes serious damage to its native hosts, the eastern honey bees Apis cerana. To better understand the mechanism of resistance of A. cerana against the V. destructor mite, we profiled the metabolic changes that occur in the honey bee brain during V. destructor infestation. Brain samples were collected from infested and control honey bees and then measured using an untargeted liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based global metabolomics method, in which 7918 and 7462 ions in ESI+ and ESI- mode, respectively, were successfully identified. Multivariate statistical analyses were applied, and 64 dysregulated metabolites, including fatty acids, amino acids, carboxylic acid, and phospholipids, amongst others, were identified. Pathway analysis further revealed that linoleic acid metabolism; propanoate metabolism; and glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism were acutely perturbed. The data obtained in this study offer insight into the defense mechanisms of A. cerana against V. destructor mites and provide a better method for understanding the synergistic effects of parasitism on honey bee colonies.",

The injection volume was 10 \u00b5l, and the flow rate was set to 0.4 ml/min.",

During the acquisition, the LE signal was acquired every 3 s to calibrate the mass accuracy. Furthermore, in order to evaluate the stability of the LC-MS during the whole acquisition, a quality control sample (pool of all samples) was acquired after every 10 samples.",

The quality of the models was evaluated with the relevant R2 and Q2 as described elsewhere[1]. Meanwhile, permutation tests (1000 cycles) were conducted to assess the robustness of the PLS-DA model. Differential metabolites were selected when the statistically significant threshold of variable influence on projection (VIP) values obtained from the PLS-DA model was larger than 1.0. Meanwhile, differences were tested with a Student\u2019s t-test, and a corrected p\u2013value (q-value) < 0.05 was deemed statistically significant. Log2 fold change (FC) was used to show how these selected differential metabolites varied between groups. A heat map was generated using the MultiExperiment Viewer (MeV) v.4.9 software (http://www.tm4.org/mev.html) based on the abundance of differentially expressed metabolite data (log2-scaled)[2]. To check and confirm the putative differentially expressed metabolites, the HMDB and KEGG databases were used[3][4]. Candidate metabolites were confirmed by MS/MS scans for the characteristic ions and fragmentation patterns of the compound. A pathway analysis of the differentially expressed metabolites was performed based on the HMDB and KEGG databases.\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Lee KR, Lin X, Park DC, Eslava S.
