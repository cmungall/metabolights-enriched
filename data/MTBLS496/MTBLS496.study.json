                "description": "The metabolome changes of Campylobacter jejuni with resistant gene ermB remain unclear. Here, we described an untargeted metabolomic workflow based on ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry to investigate the metabolites perturbations mediated by ermB in C. jejuni. After optimization of extractants and chromatographic conditions, the combination of 100% methanol extraction with a 12 min gradient by C18 column was adopted for untargeted metabolomic profiling in reversed phase separation. Meanwhile, 60% methanol extraction followed by a 14 min separation using hydrophilic interaction chromatography column was suitable to complementally expand the metabolite coverage of C. jejuni. Multivariate statistical analysis was performed by means of orthogonal projection to latent structures-discriminant analysis to select metabolic features. The selected features were further confirmed by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem quadrupole mass spectrometry. A total of thirty-six differential metabolites between the susceptible strain (C. jejuni NCTC 11168) and resistant stain (C. jejuni NCTC 11168 with ermB) were identified. These pivotal metabolites were primarily participated in biological processes as cell signaling, membrane integrity/stability, fuel and energy source/storage and nutrient. The biofilm formation capability of resistant strain was inferior to that of susceptible strain, confirming the influence of ermB on membrane integrity/stability of C. jejuni. Our findings revealed important metabolic regulatory pathways associated with resistant C. jejuni with ermB.",

                        "description": "Flash freezing in liquid nitrogen (-196 \u00b0C) was adopted to quench the metabolism and decrease the possibility of cell lysis. The metabolites were extracted with methanol for reversed phase separation or 60% methanol for hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) separation by freezing-thawing cycles. Specifically, the cell pellet was vortex-mixed with 1 ml of extractant, put in the liquid nitrogen for 2 min for freezing, and then thawed on the ice. The mixture was centrifuged at 10000 x g for 10 min at -10 \u00b0C, and the supernatant was transferred to another clean centrifuge tube. The extraction was repeated for 3 times. Mixed standard solution containing sulfadiazine, difloxacin, monensin, tylosin, and chloramphenicol was spiked into the combined supernatant for quality control (QC) at a final concentration of 500 ng/ml. The extracts were evaporated to dryness by a vacuum rotation evaporator and dissolved in 500 \u00b5l of final solution by 1 min vortexing. The final solution was acetonitrile:water (50:50, v/v, containing 0.1% formic acid) for reversed phase separation, or acetonitrile:0.5 mM ammonium acetate (95:5, v/v) for HILIC separation. The reconstituted solution was centrifuged at 20,000 x g for 10\u202f min at \u221210\u202f \u00b0C before injection into the UHPLC-MS system.\n</p>\nMixed standard solution containing sulfadiazine, difloxacin, monensin, tylosin, and chloramphenicol was spiked into the individual study samples for quality control (QC) at a final concentration of 500 ng/ml.

The mass range was set at m/z 100\u22121000 Da in the full-scan mode. The optimized ESI parameters were as follows: capillary voltage, 3 kV; cone voltage, 35 V; source temperature, 100 \u00b0C; desolvation temperature, 350 \u00b0C; desolvation gas flow, 600 l/h. For accurate mass measurement, leucine enkephalin was used as the lock spray standard ([M+H]+=556.2771; [M\u2212H]\u2212=554.2615) at a concentration of 100 ng/ml under a flow rate of 50 \u00b5l/min.\n</p>\nTo verify the reliability of UHPLC-QTOF/MS analysis, relative quantification of metabolite features was performed by UHPLC-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (MS/MS) (Acquity-Quattro LC, Waters) with ESI multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) detection. The LC separation conditions were identical to untargeted profiling. Typical MS source parameters were as follows: capillary voltage, 3.5 kV; source temperature, 100 \u00b0C; desolvation temperature, 350 \u00b0C; desolvation gas flow, 600 l/h. The transitions as well as corresponding collision energy of each feature were summarized in Table S1 of the paper associsted with this study. The fold change (FC) was calculated by comparing the mean response of each features in CJ-ermB versus that of CJ-11168. The features with FC>=1.5 were selected for further identification.",
