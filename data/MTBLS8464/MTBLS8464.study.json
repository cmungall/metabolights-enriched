                "description": "<p>The increased positive impact of plant diversity on ecosystem functioning over time is often attributed to the gradual accumulation of mutualists and dilution of antagonists in diverse plant communities. While increased plant diversity alters traits related to resource acquisition, it remains unclear whether it reduces defence allocation, whether this reduction differs between roots and leaves, or varies among species.</p><p>To answer these questions, we assessed the effect of plant species richness, plant species identity and their interaction on the expression of twenty-three physical and chemical leaf and fine root defence traits of sixteen plant species in a nineteen-year-old biodiversity experiment.</p><p>Only leaf mass per area, leaf and root dry matter content, and root nitrogen, traits related to both, resource acquisition and physical defence, responded consistently to species richness. However, species richness promoted a decoupling of these physical defences in leaves and fine roots, possibly in response to resource limitations in diverse communities. Changes in traits related to chemical defence and mutualist collaboration, however, varied among species, possibly in response to species-specific antagonists\u2019 dilution.</p><p>Overall, our study suggests that resource limitation in diverse communities mediates the relationship between plant defence traits and antagonist dilution.</p>",

Due to the randomness of species selection in the experimental design and the local extinction of certain species in specific plots, not all species were uniformly represented across the diversity gradient. In addition, the number of sampled species per plot combination varied depending on the species (refer to Supporting Information Table S1 in the paper associated with this study for detailed species occurrences).</p><p><br></p><p>In each plot, we sampled above- and below-ground parts of 3 individuals per species. An additional one or two individuals were harvested for small species to collect enough leaf and fine root material for chemical analyses. The 428 sampled individuals were randomly selected and marked in early spring avoiding plot edges. The aboveground plant part was harvested by cutting the stem 1-2 cm above the ground and placed in a sealed plastic bag along with a wet paper towel to rehydrate the leaves to their full potential (P\u00e9rez-Harguindeguy et al., 2013). We sampled the roots of the same individuals with a soil core measuring 10 x 6.9 cm (depth x diameter). All collected samples were quickly put into a cooling box and transferred to a 4 \u00b0C refrigerator within 6 h. Samples were processed from 6-26 h after sample collection. Subsamples for the metabolome analysis were always collected within 14 h after field collection.</p>",

After a subsequent round of freeze-drying, 10 mg of tissue material was extracted and reduced to powder in 2mL tubes with ceramic beads using a ball mill (Retsch MM400, Haan, Germany) for 8 min at 30 Hz. The powdered material was then extracted with 500 \u00b5L of buffer comprising 75% v/v methanol (HPLC grade), 25% v/v acetate buffer (2.3 mL acetic acid and 3.41 g ammonium acetate in 1 L of Milli-Q water, pH adjusted to 4.8), and 50 \u00b5L of 100 mM IAA-Valin as an internal standard. Subsequently, the samples were homogenized with ceramic beads and a ball mill (Retsch MM400, Haan, Germany) at 30 Hz for 5 min. The resulting mixture was centrifuged at 15,000 x g for 15 min at room temperature. The supernatant obtained was carefully collected, and the pellet underwent a second extraction with an additional 500 \u00b5L of buffer. The two supernatants were then combined and further diluted at a ratio of 1:5 with the extraction buffer. The resulting extracts were stored at -20 \u00b0C overnight, followed by a 10-min centrifugation at 15,000 x g. The clarified supernatant was transferred to HPLC vials.</p>",

The instrument settings were as follows: Scan range: 90-1600 m/z; Nebulizer: 2.5 bar; Dry gas flow (nitrogen): 11 L/min; Dry gas temperature: 220 \u00b0C; Capillary voltage: 4500 V; End plate offset: 500 V; Funnel 1 radio frequency (RF): 200 Volts peak-to-peak (Vpp); Funnel 2 RF: 220 Vpp; In-source collision-induced dissociation (CID) energy: 0.0 eV; Hexapole RF: 120 Vpp; Quadrupole ion energy: 4 eV; Quadrupole low mass: 100 m/z; Collision gas: nitrogen; Collision energy: 10 eV; Prepulse storage: 7 \u00b5s. For MS/MS fragmentation, the qToF mass spectrometer operated under similar conditions with specific parameters for the collision cell (quadrupole): Collision cell RF: From 400 to 1000 Vpp; Transfer time: From 30 to 70 \u00b5s; Timing: 50/50%; Collision energy for MS/MS: 80%; Timing: 50/50%. Data-dependent CID settings: Intensity threshold: 600; Cycle time: 1 s; Active exclusion: after 2 spectra; Release: after 0.5 min; Smart exclusion: off. Isolation and fragmentation settings: Size- and charge-dependent: width 3-15 m/z; collision energy: 20-30 eV; Charge states included: 1z, 2z and 3z. The mass calibration for each chromatogram was executed through an automated infusion at the conclusion of the gradient, employing an HPC mode with a flow rate of 0.1 mL/h. This involved the infusion of a 10 mM sodium formate cluster of NaOH dissolved in a 50/50 (v/v) mixture of isopropanol and water, containing 0.2% formic acid.</p>",

The following settings were used for the peak detection: Intensity threshold: 5000 counts; Minimum peak length: 7 spectra; Feature signal: intensity; Minimum peak length for recursive feature extraction: 7 spectra; Retention time range: 0-18 min; Mass range: 90-1600 m/z; MS/MS import method: average, grouped by collision energy. The settings for the ion deconvolution were as follows: EIC correlation: 0.8; Primary ion: [M+H]+; Common ions: [M+H-H2O]+; Seed ions: [M+Na]+, [M+K]+; T-ReX-Positive Recalibration: Auto-Detect. We used the following filters: Minimum number of samples: present in 3 of 209; Minimum for recursive feature extraction: present in 3 of 819; Grouping for group filters: species/tissue (n=3), Group filter: feature used when present in at least all samples (100%) of one group.

For these features, we performed a de-novo feature annotation and classification based on MS/MS fragmentation pattern with SIRIUS version 5.7.2 (D\u00fchrkop et al., 2019). Annotations were re-ranked with ZODIAC (Ludwig et al., 2020), molecular structures were assigned with CSI:FingerID (D\u00fchrkop et al., 2015; Hoffmann et al., 2021) and classified using the deep neural network-based natural product classifier (NPClassifier; Kim et al. 2021). We used 5 ppm accuracy and limited the element to CHNPOS and left the other setting to default for SIRIUS and ZODIAC. For CSI:FingerID, formulas from all databases were selected. We discharged features with a ZODIAC score lower than 0.5 and NPC pathway probability lower than 0.5.</p><p><br></p><p>References:</p><p>D\u00fchrkop K, Fleischauer M, Ludwig M, Aksenov AA, Melnik A V., Meusel M, Dorrestein PC, Rousu J, B\u00f6cker S. 2019.
