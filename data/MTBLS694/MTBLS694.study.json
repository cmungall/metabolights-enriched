All study samples were diluted with ultrapure water (75 \u03bcl for reversed-phase chromatography preparation, commensurate with the volume of QC sample dilution caused by the addition of method reference. The IS solution (75 \u03bcl) was added to all samples.</br>\nSample plates were sealed with a silicone cap mat, mixed for one minute at 4 \u00b0C using a MixMate (Eppendorf) operating at 850 rpm, and centrifuged for 10 mins at 3486 \u00d7 g. The supernatant was split between two analytical microwell plates, one for positive and one for negative ion mode UPLC - MS analysis. Prepared plates were loaded into a 2777C sample manager (Waters Corp., Milford, MA, USA) where they were held at 4 \u00b0C under a constant flow of nitrogen until analysis.</br>\nA dilution series of study reference samples (1%, 10%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80% and 100% original concentration) was prepared in the same manner described above except that they were prepared in bulk volume in Eppendorf microcentrifuge tubes and the products were stored in polypropylene sample vials for analysis supporting multiple injections from the same stock.

A 99.8% deuterated methanol (MeOD) standard sample in a sealed 5 mm NMR tube was used to calibrate the temperature before each run of samples. The purpose of the temperature calibration is to ensure that urine samples are run at exactly 300 K. A standard 2 mM sucrose sample (containing 0.5 mM TSP, 2 mM NaN3 in 90% H2O:10% D2O) was loaded into the magnet and used to check the performance of the water suppression functionality.</br></br>\n\nOne of the composite QC samples was used to set up the parameters that are not automatically calculated, such as the center of the frequency window for 1H spectroscopy and the shimming file. The SampleJet mode is changed to the 5 mm shuttle automation mode and the QC sample is introduced. A wait of 5 mins to equilibrate the temperature (urine samples are run at 300 K) is required.</br></br>\n\nSpectra were acquired using the Bruker noesygppr1d pulse sequence. Relaxation delay of 4 s was used, t was a short delay of about 3 \u03bcs, tm, the mixing time was 10 ms, and data acquisition period (2.7 s). Application of the gradients ensures that dispersive residual water signals are filtered out and do not contribute to the final spectrum. The spectral window was set to 20 ppm for urine. In total 32 transients were acquired with 64k data points.\n",

The raw data files were converted from .RAW format to .mzML format using the msconvert tool from the ProteoWizard tookit [2], for feature-detection with XCMS. msconvert was configured to discard scans below an intensity threshold of 100, and only retain scans from the first acquisition function (--filter 'scanEvent 1' --filter 'threshold absolute 100 most-intense'). Peak detection was by the centwave algorithm configured with a noise threshold of 600, mass accuracy of 25ppm, and minmum and maximum peakwidth of 1.5 and 5 seconds. Retention time alignment was performed using the \u2018density\u2019 method.</br></br>\n\nRef:</br>\n[1] Lewis MR, Pearce JT, Spagou K, Green M, Dona AC, Yuen AH, David M, Berry DJ, Chappell K, Horneffer-van der Sluis V, Shaw R, Lovestone S, Elliott P, Shockcor J, Lindon JC, Cloarec O, Takats Z, Holmes E, Nicholson JK.
