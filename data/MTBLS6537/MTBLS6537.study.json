                "description": "<p>Biological nitrogen fixation by free-living bacteria and rhizobial symbiosis with legumes plays a key role in sustainable crop production. Here, we study how different crop combinations influence the interaction between peanut plants and their rhizosphere microbiota via metabolite deposition and functional responses of free-living and symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Based on a long-term (8 year) diversified cropping field experiment, we find that peanut co-cultured with maize and oilseed rape lead to specific changes in peanut rhizosphere metabolite profiles and bacterial functions and nodulation. Flavonoids and coumarins accumulate due to the activation of phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathways in peanuts. These changes enhance the growth and nitrogen fixation activity of free-living bacterial isolates, and root nodulation by symbiotic Bradyrhizobium isolates. Peanut plant root metabolites interact with Bradyrhizobium isolates contributing to initiate nodulation. Our findings demonstrate that tailored intercropping could be used to improve soil nitrogen availability through changes in the rhizosphere microbiome and its functions.</p>",

                        "description": "<p><strong>Field experiment site and design</strong></p><p>For this study, samples were collected from a long-term field experiment, established in 2011 at the Yingtan Red Soil Ecological Experimental Station of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Jiangxi Province, China (28\u00b012'N, 116\u00b055'E). The climate is subtropical (<strong>[1]</strong> for more detailed description). The soil is an acidic, loamy clay derived from Quaternary Red Clay and classified as a Ferralic Cambisol<strong>[2]</strong>. Before the establishment of this experiment, the site was a mass pine (Pinus massonina Lamb.) natural secondary forest.</p><p><br></p><p>The field experiment compared three crop systems based on common practices in local intensive agricultural systems of tropics and subtropics<strong>[3][4]</strong>: (I) a single-crop system (PP, monoculture of peanut, Arachis hypogaea), (II) a two-crop system (P-R, rotation of peanut and oilseed rape Brassica campestris) and (III) a three-crop system (PM-R, intercropping peanut and maize Zea mays L., rotated with oilseed rape). Each treatment was carried out in 3 randomized blocks, with 3 replicate plots of 20 m x 5 m x 1.5 m (width x length x depth), each plot further divided into 3 subplots. The plots were separated by 10 cm (thickness) concrete baffle plates and the subplots by ridges.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Field cropping practices</strong></p><p>The design of the three-crop system (PM-R, intercropping peanut and maize, rotated with oilseed rape) during the spring-summer season (April-August) included a 1.0 m peanut strip (2 rows of peanut, with a 0.5 m interrow distance) and a 1.0 m maize strip (2 rows of maize, with a 0.5 m interrow distance). The interplant distance within the same row was 0.2 m for peanuts and 0.25 m for maize. In the single-crop system (PP, monoculture of peanut) and two-crop system (P-R, rotation of peanut and oilseed rape) treatments, the interrow and interplant distances for peanut were 0.5 and 0.2 m, respectively, which made the peanut density identical to that in a comparable area of the PM-R treatment. During the autumn-winter season (September-March), the interrow and interplant distances for oilseed rape were 0.5 and 0.2 m, respectively, in the P-R and PM-R treatments. Peanut and maize were sown on the 1st-15th April, and oilseed rape was sown on the 1st-15th September. The topsoil (0-25 cm) was ploughed before cultivation every year. All plots were irrigated and weeded during the growing period.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Field soil characteristics and annual fertilizations</strong></p><p>The basic soil characteristics of the field experiment in 2012 were as follows: organic matter 4.58 g/kg, total N 0.45 g/kg, total P 0.35 g/kg, total K 11.84 g/kg, available P 1.68 mg/kg, available K 54.17 mg/kg, NH4+-N 5.24 mg/kg, NO3--N 2.59 mg/kg and pH 4.84. All treatment groups received urea (containing 46% N), calcium superphosphate (containing 12.5% P2O5) and potassium chloride (containing 60.0% K2O) chemical fertilizers at rates of 150, 75 and 60 kg/ha/y, respectively, 10-15 days before seeds were sown in the spring. In the oilseed rape planting season (P-R and PM-R treatments), 1/2 doses of chemical fertilizers were applied before seed sowing.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Collection of soil and plant samples</strong></p><p>Soil and peanut plant samples were collected on 10 June 2019 at the peanut flowering stage. To sample rhizosphere soil, we randomly selected 6 peanut plants from each subplot and gently brushed off the soil adhering to the root systems, resulting in one composite rhizosphere sample per subplot (n=9 per treatment). The removed plants were used for determining plant height, biomass and nodulation. To sample the bulk soil, we collected 6 soil cores in each subplot (5-20 cm depth), 25 cm away from crop roots, using an 'S' sampling pattern, and then pooled the cores into one composite bulk soil sample per subplot (n=9 per treatment). All samples were immediately sieved at 4 mm to remove plant debris and stones. From each soil sample, 3 g was stored at -80 \u00b0C for microbial molecular analysis, while another 20 g was stored at 4 \u00b0C for soil chemical analyses. The soil chemical properties were characterized by standard methods below. In addition, 3 g of each rhizosphere soil sample was frozen in liquid nitrogen and transported on dry ice for soil metabolic analysis. Of the latter group, 2 samples per treatment were set aside for pre-analysis but were subsequently lost due to a broken freezer; hence for the metabolite analysis n=7 instead of n=9. Finally, 5 g of each rhizosphere sample from the PM-R treatment was stored at 4 \u00b0C for functional bacterial isolation.</p><p><br></p><p>Based on the results of the rhizosphere metabolic analysis, we collected fresh peanut root samples from the PP and PM-R treatments on 15 June 2020 for root transcriptome analysis and gene expression. For each treatment, 7 randomly selected peanut plants (2-3 plants per replicate plot) were dug out using a shovel. Roots were immediately separated from the plants and washed twice with sterile water. Next, tissues 3-9 cm from the root bases were cut into small pieces (2 cm length), frozen in liquid nitrogen, and transported to the laboratory for RNA extraction, transcriptome sequencing and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Rhizosphere soil nontargeted metabolic analysis</strong></p><p>To determine the effect of crop diversification on metabolic deposition in the peanut rhizosphere, the metabolic composition of peanut rhizosphere soil samples was determined by nontargeted metabolic profiling, using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS). Each sample was ultrasonically extracted in an acetonitrile diluent before the analysis. A nontargeted approach with a Q-Exactive quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer was used to identify metabolites<strong>[5]</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p>For chemical standard validation, quercetin, hyperoside, scopoletin and syringaldehyde analytical standards (purity &gt; 98%, J&amp;K Scientific, CA, USA) were dissolved in methanol (1 mg/mL, mother solution), respectively. Then each solution was diluted to 10 \u00b5g/mL using 50% acetonitrile. Each dilution was filtered through a polytetrafluoroethylene filter for UHPLC-MS/MS analysis as mentioned above. The platform of non-targeted metabolism and targeted validation work received technical support from Shanghai Sanshu Biotechnology Co., LTD.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Chen Y, Bonkowski M, Shen Y, Griffiths BS, Jiang Y, Wang X, Sun B.

This process resulted in the construction of a 3D-data matrix comprising retention time-m/z pairs, peak intensities and sample information. Baseline correction was initially applied to eliminate systematic fluctuations in signal intensity unrelated to the analytes of interest. Subsequently, peak detection algorithms were employed to identify peaks corresponding to individual compounds or molecular fragments within the spectra. Peak alignment procedures were then utilized to ensure accurate matching of peaks across different spectra, considering variations in retention time or mass accuracy. Additionally, normalization techniques were employed to adjust for differences in sample loading or instrumental response, facilitating comparative analysis between samples. Finally, data filtering was implemented to eliminate noise or artifacts that could potentially interfere with downstream analysis, thereby ensuring the reliability and integrity of the transformed data for subsequent interpretation and biological insights.</p><p><br></p><p>Metabolites were then identified and annotated by progenesis QI (Waters Corporation, Milford, USA) Data Processing Software, based on MS/MS fragmentation data from the public databases including&nbsp;METLIN, HMDB and in-house spectral library. And 5 ppm and 10 ppm mass tolerance was used for precursor and fragment respectively. We then evaluated the preprocessed data using a strategy combining multivariate and univariate methods. Supervised orthogonal partial least square-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) was used to discriminate the metabolites that were altered after the analysis between the 2 groups of samples. The validation of OPLS-DA models was performed following the 7-fold cross-validation process. Variable importance in the projection (VIP) value was used to rank the contribution of each variable for the established OPLS-DA model. Variables with VIP value &gt; 1 were seen as significant for group discrimination. The differentially expressed metabolites were selected by combining the VIP value threshold (VIP &gt; 1) obtained by the OPLS-DA model with p-values (p &lt; 0.05) from a 2-tailed Student's t test on the normalized peak areas.</p>",
