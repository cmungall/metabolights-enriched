        "description": "A new approach to recovery of information from faecal samples, based on analysis of the molecular signature generated by rapid evaporative ionisation mass spectrometry (REIMS). Faecal pellets from five different rodent species were analysed by REIMS and complex mass spectra were acquired rapidly(typically a few seconds per sample). The uninterpreted mass spectra (signatures) were then used to seed linear discriminant analysis and classification models based on random forests. It was possible to classify each species of origin with ahigh rate of accuracy, whether faeces were from animals maintained under standard laboratory conditions or wild-caught. REIMS signatures were stable to prior storage of the faecal material under a range ofdifferent conditions and were not altered rapidlyor radicallyby changes in diet. Further, within species, REIMS signatures could be used to discriminate faeces from adult versus juvenile mice, male versus female mice and those from three different laboratory strains. REIMS offers a completely novel method for the rapid analysis of faecal samples, extending faecal analysis(previously focused on DNA) to an assessment of phenotype,and has considerable potential as a new tool in the armamentarium of the field biologist.",

Inbred or random-bred laboratory strains were <strong>Hsd:ICR (CD-1, 'IC')</strong>, <strong>C57BL/6JOlaHsd (C57BL/6)</strong> and <strong>BALB/cOlaHsd (BALB/c)</strong> were in-house bred. Rats were 8 to 9 mth old from a random-bred cross between <strong>Wistar (HsdHan:WIST, InVivo, Bicester, UK)</strong> and <strong>Brown Norway (BN/SsNOlaHsd, InVivo, UK)</strong> laboratory strains, originally obtained from Envigo UK and subsequently crossbred in-house for 3 generations. <strong>Bank voles</strong>, <strong>field voles</strong> and male <strong>house mice</strong> were housed singly in 48 x 15 x 13 cm cages (M3, North Kent Plastics, UK). Female <strong>house mice</strong> were housed in groups of 2 to 4 full siblings in 45 x 28 x 13 cm cages (MB1, North Kent Plastics, UK). <strong>Wood mice</strong> were housed singly in 38 x 25 x 18 cm cages (RM2, North Kent Plastics, UK). <strong>Rats</strong> were housed in same-sex pairs in 56 x 38 x 22 cm cages (RC2R, North Kent Plastics, UK).</p><p><br></p><p>All animals were fed 5FL2 EURodent Diet (IPS Product Supplies Limited, London, UK) <em>ad libitum</em> and had access to water <em>ad libitum</em>. <strong>Wood mice</strong>, <strong>bank voles</strong> and <strong>field voles</strong> were supplemented with Harry Hamster complete muesli (Supreme Petfoods Ltd., Ipswich, UK) and hay. <strong>Field voles</strong> were also given fresh-cut grass. All cages had Corn Cob Absorb 10/14 substrate (IPS Product Supplies Limited, London, UK) lining the base. Cardboard tubes and paper wool nest material were provided to all animals for enrichment, with 15 x 8 cm plastic tubes also provided for rats. Animal numbers are summarised in <strong>Table S1</strong> in the paper associated with this study.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Collection of faecal pellets:</strong></p><p>Laboratory-housed rodents were placed individually into a clean laboratory cage for 1 to 2 h, and multiple faecal pellets were collected from each individual. The order of sample collection from each animal was randomised.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Wild rodent sample collection:</strong></p><p>Longworth traps, Mk1 or Mk2 TubeTraps (BioEcoSS Ltd., Shropshire, UK) and Ugglan traps were set in 5 separate locations: Kielder Forest (Northumberland, UK); Ness Botanic Gardens (Wirral, UK); Wood Park Farm (Wirral, UK); University of Liverpool, Leahurst Campus (Wirral, UK); and a private garden in Mouldsworth (Cheshire, UK); locations are recorded in <strong>Table S1</strong> in the paper associated with this study. Traps, cleaned before every use, were baited with parakeet seed mix (Rob Harvey, Tongham, UK) and a piece of apple. Hay was provided in the traps as bedding material. Traps were checked twice daily. Species and sex of all trapped animals were recorded, and multiple faecal pellets were taken from each trap. Sex was determined using anogenital distance. No faecal samples were taken when more than 1 animal was captured in the same trap, and animals were fur clipped to avoid repeated sampling. Faecal samples from wild Norway rats (<em>Rattus norvegicus</em>) were obtained as loose droppings from building floors at Wood Park Farm (Wirral, UK), Ness Heath Farm (Wirral, UK) and Shotton Industrial Estate (Wirral, UK). The distance between the sample locations and local population density ensured that samples were very likely to be from different individuals. For the discrimination study for wild rodents, samples were collected from 80 <strong>bank voles</strong>, 40 <strong>field voles</strong>, 74 <strong>wood mice</strong> and 29 <strong>rats</strong> (see <strong>Table S1</strong> in the paper associated with this study) and stored for up to 15 d at -20 \u00b0C before the analysis.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Evaluation of storage conditions:</strong></p><p>Faecal donors were 12 male captive-bred house mice (bred for 5-10 generations from populations captured in Northwest England) aged 11 to 13 mth. Multiple faecal samples were collected from each donor and stored in closed Eppendorf tubes at 4 temperatures: -18 \u00b0C, \u22124 \u00b0C, 21 \u00b0C and ambient (mean 18.25 \u00b0C, max 24\u00b0C, min 17 \u00b0C). Ambient temperature samples were stored in open or closed Eppendorf tubes. Samples were stored for 1 d, 1 wk or 4 wk. Samples were randomly allocated to each temperature and time condition. For each donor, a sample was stored for each temperature and time condition, giving 15 samples per donor.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Diet study sample collection:</strong></p><p>Test subjects were 48 singly housed wild-stock male <strong>house mice</strong> (9 to 18 mth old, bred for 5\u201310 generations from populations captured in Northwest England). All subjects were fed 5FL2 EURodent Diet ad libitum prior to the start of the study. At the start of the study, mice were assigned to 4 treatment groups (n = 12) and fed different diets. During an acclimation week, subjects were fed a mixture of 5FL2 EURodent Diet and their new diet. From the second week, <strong>house mice</strong> were fed only their new diet for a further 4 wk. Diets were Poultry Grower (SDS, Braintree, UK), Harry Hamster complete muesli (Supreme Petfoods Ltd., Ipswich, UK), Turbo 40 pig feed (Massey Bros Feeds Ltd., Crewe, UK) and 5FL2 EURodent Diet (IPS Product Supplies Limited, London, UK). Faecal samples were collected from each mouse on the first day of the study and at weekly intervals over the study.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Sex, maturity and strain study:</strong></p><p>Test subjects came from 2 inbred laboratory mouse strains, <strong>C57BL/6JOlaHsd (C57BL/6)</strong> and <strong>BALB/cOlaHsd (BALB/c)</strong>, and 1 random-bred laboratory strain, <strong>Hsd:ICR (CD-1, 'ICR (CD-1)')</strong>. The strains were originally obtained from Envigo UK and subsequently bred in-house. They were maintained in MB1 cages, and faecal samples were collected by temporary transfer to M3 cages. All animals were fed on 5FL2 EURodent Diet and had access to water <em>ad libitum</em>. All cages contained Corn Cob Absorb 10/14 substrate, 15 x 5 cm plastic tubes and paper wool nest material. Samples were collected from 176 individuals (see <strong>Table S1</strong> in the paper associated with this study; <strong>BALB/c</strong> and <strong>BALB.K</strong> were combined for this study). Samples were stored at 4 \u00b0C for up to 7 d or at -18 \u00b0C for up to 30 d prior to analysis.</p>",

Mass spectra were imported into Waters Offline Model Builder software (OMB-1.1.28, Waters Research Centre, Hungary) or LiveID (Waters). Within Offline Model Builder spectral data above, the intensity threshold of 3 x 10^5 counts were summed for each data point, accumulating data from multiple faecal pellets from the same animal. Within LiveID, intensity threshold was set automatically, and the exported, binned data were further processed in R. Mass spectra were then lockmass corrected to either a propan-2-ol background peak at 325.19 m/z or leu-enkephalin at 554.26 m/z. For analysis, a mass range of 400 to 1100 m/z was used. The resulting spectra were normalised, scaled and binned by either LiveID or Offline Model Builder (Waters) at 0.05 or 0.1 m/z bin width. Binned data (approx. 14,000 or 7000 data points) were exported as .csv data files for further analysis. For some experiments, data were analysed by principal component analysis (<strong>PCA</strong>) followed by discriminant function analysis (<strong>DFA</strong>) using either <strong>SSPS version 24</strong> (IBM, Portsmouth, UK) or R. Random forest classification was achieved with package <strong>'randomForest'[1]</strong> using <strong>R version 3.4.2.[2]</strong>. For random forest analysis, 2 analyses were completed-in the first, all samples were included in the classification, and in the second, we retained 70% as a training set and used the trees generated therefore to assess the remaining 30%. A confusion matrix was generated to determine the accuracy of classification for each species or another category. Specific ions that made the greatest contribution to classification were identified using the <strong>randomForestExplainer package[3]</strong> in R. Data were visualised with <strong>SPSS</strong> or with '<strong>ggplot2</strong>' in the R environment<strong>[4]</strong>. In some instances, the top informative ions included both the monoisotopic ion and the first 13C isotopomer that were identified and confirmed by plotting a cross-correlation matrix for the intensities of these ions\u2014such isotopically linked pairs exhibited a very high degree of correlation, as would be expected (see <strong>Figure S3</strong> in the paper associated with this study).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Liaw A, Wiener M.

Sampling was of 3 to 5 pellets from the same individual and/or condition for data acquisition for 2-5 s per pellet. Sample processing was conducted blind to the treatment condition of the sample, and the order of sample processing was randomised.</p><p><br></p><p>Aerosol particles were aspirated using a Venturi gas jet pump powered by nitrogen on the REIMS source via a 3-m evacuation tubing incorporated into the electrosurgical pencil. The Venturi pump introduces the aerosol orthogonally to the inlet capillary of the mass spectrometer, which is then drawn into the source by the vacuum of the instrument. This geometry, combined with a specially designed whistle within the Venturi housing, ensures that the larger particles are not drawn into the capillary where they could cause a blockage.</p><p><br></p><p>Laboratory animal and storage studies were conducted using the beta version of the impactor (ceramic cylinder) whereas the wild animal and diet study samples were analysed using the commercial version (Kanthal metal coil).</p>",
