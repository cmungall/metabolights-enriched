                "description": "<p>The emergence of high-virulent <em>Acinetobacter baumannii</em> strains increases the mortality of patients and seriously affects their prognosis, which motivates us to explore novel ways to control such infections. In this study, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was adopted to explore the metabolic difference between high- and low-virulent <em>A. baumannii</em> strains, and the decreased L-serine levels were identified as the most crucial biomarker in low-virulent <em>A. baumannii</em> strains. <em>In vitro,</em> L-serine reduced the virulence of <em>A. baumannii</em> to Beas 2B cells and inhibited the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome via decreasing the generation of ROS and mtROS and the release of inflammatory cytokines (IL-18 and IL-1\u03b2) through upregulating SIRT1. <em>In vivo</em>, the <em>Galleria mellonella</em> model was adopted. L-serine downregulated the levels of virulence genes (ompA, carO and omp33-36), reduced the mortality of <em>A. baumannii</em> to <em>G. mellonella</em>, and decreased the blacking speed as well as the degree of <em>G. mellonella</em> after infection. Taken together, we found that L-serine can reduce the virulence of <em>A. baumannii</em> and enhance the host\u2019s defense against the pathogen, providing a novel strategy for the treatment of infections caused by <em>A. baumannii</em>.</p>",
