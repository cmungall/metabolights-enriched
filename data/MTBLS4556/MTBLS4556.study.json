                "description": "<p>The totality of environmental exposures and lifestyle factors, commonly referred to as the exposome, are poorly understood. Measuring the myriad of chemicals that humans are exposed to is immensely challenging and identifying disrupted metabolic pathways is even more complex. Here, we present a novel technological approach for the comprehensive, rapid and integrated analysis of the endogenous human metabolome and the chemical exposome. By combining reverse-phase and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography and fast polarity switching, molecules with highly diverse chemical structures can be analyzed in 15 min with a single analytical run as both column\u2019s effluents are combined before analysis. Standard reference materials and authentic standards were evaluated to critically benchmark performance. Highly sensitive median limits of detection (LOD) with 0.04 \u03bcM for &gt;140 quantitatively assessed endogenous metabolites and 0.08 ng/mL for the &gt;100 model xenobiotics and human estrogens in solvent were obtained. In matrix, the median LOD values were higher with 0.7 ng/mL (urine) and 0.5 ng/mL (plasma) for exogenous chemicals. To prove the dual-column approach\u2019s applicability, real-life urine samples from sub-Saharan Africa (high exposure scenario) and Europe (low exposure scenario) were assessed in a targeted and non-targeted manner. Our LC-HRMS approach demonstrates the feasibility of quantitatively and simultaneously assessing the endogenous metabolome and the chemical exposome for the high-throughput measurement of environmental drivers of disease.</p>",

For details kindly refer to the publication<strong>[1]</strong>. Furthermore, urine samples from Nigerian women sampled in 2016 were investigated. This longitudinal sample set was already analyzed before on biomarkers of mycotoxin exposure<strong>[2]</strong>. Therefore not all samples from the original study were available due to limited sample volumes. The sample set included 77 spot urine specimens from 4 timepoints (morning and evening over 2 days) of 23 mothers. All samples were stored at -80 \u00b0C until analysis.

In the context of this paper, the estrogens are evaluated together with the xenobiotic substances and mentioned accordingly. In addition, 15 different isotopically labelled standards of xenobiotics and a separate 13C-labelled yeast extract (ISOtopic solutions, Vienna) were used as internal standards. A complete list of all analytes is available in the Supporting Information (Table S1) in the paper associated with this study. A 24 h pooled urine sample obtained from a healthy female volunteer collected on 1 day after 3 days of a low xenoestrogen/polyphenol diet was chosen as a model matrix in this study since urine is frequently used for assessing chemical exposure. Moreover, as a second model matrix, pooled human Li-Heparin plasma was acquired from Innovative Research (Novi, USA). Arylsulfatase/\u03b2-glucuronidase from Helix pomatia was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Vienna, Austria). All materials were stored at -80 \u00b0C prior to extraction.

For the experiment to determine the best solvent/column combination no internal standard was used. Therefore only 40 \u03bcL H2O were used instead of the internal standard mix. The samples were then vortexed. Afterwards, the samples were mixed with 760 \u03bcL of extraction solvent (ACN:MeOH (1:1, v/v)). After thoroughly vortexing and sonication on ice (10 min), the samples were put at -20 \u00b0C for 2 h and centrifuged at 18,000 x g and 4 \u00b0C (10 min) and 960 \u03bcL of the supernatant was transferred to a new tube. Then, the samples were evaporated in a vacuum concentrator (Labconco). The residues were reconstituted in 192 \u03bcL solvent (ACN:water, 50:50, v/v), vortexed and centrifuged at 4 \u00b0C for 10 min.

This additional step was not performed for the other samples because the heat treatment would have disturbed measurements of endogenous metabolites. A non-deconjugated sample was prepared for the SRM material for comparison as well.</p><p><br></p><p>As quality control samples, SRM 1950 in 1 to 10 dilution and a solvent QC comprising all target analytes at 1 \u03bcM (median of 186 ng/mL, metabolites) and approximately 100 ng/mL (xenobiotics) were analyzed throughout the sequence. Moreover, 10 \u03bcL of each urine sample was pooled together for the Austrian and Nigerian samples separately. This pooled urine sample from the Austrian study was measured every 9 injections while measuring these samples. The Nigerian pooled urine sample was injected repeatedly with a maximum of 9 individual samples in between to check the instrument performance. Solvent blanks (pure reconstitution solvent) and system blanks (200 \u03bcL water extracted according to the sample preparation protocol) were measured to correct for contaminations in the system and during the sample preparation.</p>",

Different column/eluent systems were examined. The RP gradient was derived from literature<strong>[1]</strong> and the HILIC gradient was based on mutliple publications<strong>[2]-[4]</strong>. The NH4F concentration in the aqueous RP eluent was increased to 0.6 mM NH4F to ensure at least 0.3 mM NH4F after dilution with the effluent from the other column before introduction to the MS. If NH4F was used in both eluents, the modifier\u2019s concentration was increased to in total 2 mM NH4F as used previously<strong>[3]</strong>. As a reverse-phase column (RP), an Acquity HSS T3 (1.8 \u03bcm, 100 x 2.1 mm) was used. For HILIC chromatography, two different hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography columns (HILIC) were used, namely, a SeQuant ZIC-pHILIC (5 \u03bcm, polymeric, 150 x 2.1 mm) and an Acquity BEH Amide (1.8 \u03bcm, 100 x 2.1 mm). Eluent B was in all cases 100% ACN. The aqueous eluent (solvent A) was changed as stated in Table 1 in the paper associated with this study. The selection of the NH4F concentration in the aqueous HILIC eluent was as used previously<strong>[3]</strong> at either 1 mM or 2 mM. The injection volume was 5 \u03bcL for all columns and experiments.</p><p><br></p><p>For the RP measurements, the gradient was as follows: 0.0-1.0 min, constant flow at 10% B; 1.0-10.0 min, increase to 70% B; 10.0-11.0 min, rise to 100% B; 13.5-15.0 min, equilibration at 10% B. A hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography column (HILIC), SeQuant ZIC-pHILIC (5 \u03bcm, polymeric, 150 x 2.1 mm) was operated with the following gradient: 0.0-1.0 min, constant flow at 75% B; 1.0-6.0 min, linear decrease to 50%; 6.0-7.0 min, drop to 30% B; 7.0-11.0 min, constant flow at 30%; 11.0-15.0 min, equilibration at 75% B. Both columns were at 40 \u00b0C and a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min was set. The Acquity BEH Amide was operated with a slightly different gradient as follows: 0.0-2.0 min, constant at 80% B; 2.0-8.0 min decrease to 40% B; 8.0-10.0 min, constant at 40% B and 10.0-15.0 min, equilibration at 80% B. Both capillaries were connected with a T-piece to mix the effluents before introduction into the ESI source of the mass spectrometer. As needle wash, 75% ACN was used for the HILIC measurement, while H2O:ACN:MeOH (2:1:1, v:v:v) was applied for the RP run.</p><p><br></p><p>Following the optimization of chromatographic conditions, the most suitable RP/HILIC combination was selected. Consequently, the parameters mentioned above for combination two were applied for the sample measurement. A reverse-phase column (RP), an Acquity HSS T3 (1.8 \u03bcm, 100 x 2.1 mm), was used. For HILIC chromatography, a SeQuant ZIC-pHILIC (5 \u03bcm, polymeric, 150 x 4.6 mm) was used Eluent B was in all cases 100% ACN. The aqueous eluent (solvent A) was changed as stated in Table 1 in the paper associated with this study. The injection volume was 5 \u03bcL for all columns and experiments. Aequeous eluent for RP was 0.3 mM NH4F in water and 2 mM NH4F in water for HILIC. For the RP measurements the gradient was as follows: 0.0-1.0 min, constant flow at 10% B; 1.0-10.0 min, increase to 70% B; 10.0-11.0 min, rise to 100% B and 13.5-15.0 min, equilibration at 10% B. A hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography column (HILIC), SeQuant ZIC-pHILIC (5 \u03bcm, polymeric, 150 x 4.6 mm) was operated with the following gradient: 0.0-1.0 min, constant flow at 75% B; 1.0-6.0 min, linear decrease to 50%; 6.0-7.0 min, drop to 30% B; 7.0-11.0 min, constant follow at 30%; 11.0-15 min, equilibration at 75% B. Both columns were at 40 \u00b0C and a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min was set. The Acquity BEH Amide was operated with a slightly different gradient as follows: 0.0-2.0 min, constant at 80% B; 2.0-8.0 min, decrease to 40% B; 8.0-10.0 min, constant at 40% B; 10.0-15.0 min, equilibration at 80% B. Both capillaries were connected with a T-piece to mix the effluents before introduction into the ESI source of the mass spectrometer. As needle wash, 75% ACN was used for the HILIC measurement, while for the RP run H2O:ACN:MeOH (2:1:1,v:v:v) was applied. A mixture of both effluents entered the mass spectrometer via the ESI source. The urine samples from Nigeria and Austria were analyzed in randomized order.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Jamnik T, Flasch M, Braun D, Fareed Y, Wasinger D, Seki D, Berry D, Berger A, Wisgrill L, Warth B.

An internal standard correction was performed. If no internal standard was included for the specific analyte, the internal standard with the closest retention time was selected as a surrogate standard for normalization. For endogenous metabolites excluding estrogens the peak originating from the HILIC column was used, while xenobiotics and endogenous estrogens were evaluated with the RP peak. The linear calibration curves were 1/x weighted. Matrix matched calibration for urine and plasma was performed and the corresponding calibration curves were used for the quantification of xenobiotics and human estrogens. However, endogenous metabolites were, as expected, frequently highly abundant in the matrices. Therefore a solvent calibration was applied for endogenous metabolites (excluding estrogens). The creatinine levels were quantitated with a one-point calibration based on the creatinine level in the SRM3672 (734 mg/L). The limits of detection (LODs) were determined based on the EURACHEM guideline<strong>[2]</strong> as 3x times the standard deviation of multiple injections of a low-concentrated standard (n=6) divided by the square root of the number of replicates. For the limit of quantification (LOQ), the tenfold standard deviation was used. The recoveries were calculated by dividing the spiked concentration by the measeasured concentration multiplied by 100. The expected concentration level in the spiked samples used for recovery calculation corresponded to standard level 6.</p><p><br></p><p>Spearman correlation was calculated for compounds positive in at least 20% of all Nigerian samples with <strong>R</strong> and plotted with the '<strong>corrplot</strong>' package (version 0.90)<strong>[3]</strong>. <strong>MetaboAnalyst</strong> 5.0 was used for pathway analysis<strong>[4]</strong>. A hypergeometric test was selected as an enrichment method and for topology analysis relative-betweenness centrality.

The suspect screening was performed in <strong>R</strong>, applying the '<strong>patRoon</strong>' package<strong>[5]</strong>. Solvent process blanks (only in the corresponding polarity) were defined as blank measurements. The <strong>raw</strong> data files were converted to <strong>mzML</strong> files and centroided with <strong>ProteoWizard[6]</strong>. For peak picking and grouping, the '<strong>openms</strong>' algorithm was set with the following parameters: noise threshold, 4e^3; chromFWHM, 3; minFWHM, 1; maxFWHM, 30; chromSNR, 5; mzPPM, 3. Only features with a minimum absolute feature intensity of 3e^5, a minimum feature intensity above blank of 10, present in at least 60% of replicates, were kept and blank analyses were removed after this step.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1] </strong>MacLean B, Tomazela DM, Shulman N, Chambers M, Finney GL, Frewen B, Kern R, Tabb DL, Liebler DC, MacCoss MJ.

Analytes which had already been included in the targeted list were removed to avoid redundancy. For the suspect screening, an m/z window of 0.002 was set. MS peak list data were extracted with the '<strong>mzr-algorithm</strong>' (precursor m/z window 0.5) and filtered (relative intensity threshold 0.02, top 10 MS/MS peaks). Then molecular formulas were generated considering [M+H]+ and [M-H]- adducts, respectively and the elements C, H, N, O, P, S, Cl, Br using <strong>genform</strong>. Chemical compounds were annotated with '<strong>metfrag</strong>' and the <strong>comptox</strong> database. The suspect screening results were refined with <strong>annotateSuspects</strong> and the generated peak lists, formula and compound data. An identification level was assigned depending on the rank and scores (isoScore, individualMoNAScore) of formula/compound candidates roughly based on literature<strong>[2]</strong>. The default settings in the <strong>annotateSuspects</strong> algorithm were applied. As no retention time data was available, level one identifications were impossible. The other identification levels were: level 2a (good MS/MS library match, top-ranked in compound results, individualMoNAScore \u2265 0.9, no MoNA library score for other candidates), level 3a (fair library match, individualMoNAScore \u2265 0.4), level 3b (known MS/MS match, at least three fragments match), level 3c (good in-silico MS/MS match, annotation MS/MS similarity (annSimComp) \u2265 0.7), level 4a (good formula MS/MS match, top-ranked formula candidate, annSimForm \u2265 0.7, isotopic match (isoScore) \u2265 0.5, both scores at least 0.2 higher than next best ranked candidate), level 4b (good formula isotopic pattern match, top ranked formula candidate, isoScore \u2265 0.9, score at least 0.2 higher than next best ranked candidate) and level 5 (nothing of the above mentioned criteria match).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Sobus JR, Grossman JN, Chao A, Singh R, Williams AJ, Grulke CM, Richard AM, Newton SR, McEachran AD, Ulrich EM.
