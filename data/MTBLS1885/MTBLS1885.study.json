                "description": "<p>Microbial life in soil is fueled by dissolved organic matter (DOM) that leaches from the litter layer. It is well known that decomposer communities adapt to the available litter source, but it remains unclear if they functionally compete or synergistically address different litter types. Therefore, we decomposed beech, oak, pine and grass litter from two geologically distinct sites in a lab-scale decomposition experiment. We performed a correlative network analysis on the results of direct infusion HR-MS DOM analysis and cross-validated functional predictions from 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and with DOM and metaproteomic analyses. Here we show that many functions are redundantly distributed within decomposer communities and that their relative expression is rapidly optimized to address litter-specific properties. However, community changes are likely forced by antagonistic mechanisms as we identified several natural antibiotics in DOM. As a consequence, the decomposer community is specializing towards the litter source and the state of decomposition (community divergence) but showing similar litter metabolomes (metabolome convergence). Our multi-omics-based results highlight that DOM not only fuels microbial life, but it additionally holds meta-metabolomic information on the functioning of ecosystems.</p>",

                        "description": "<p><strong>Sampling sites</strong></p><p>Senescent beech (<em>Fagus sylvatica</em>) and oak leaves (<em>Fraxinus excelsior</em>), pine needles (<em>Pinus sylvestris</em>) and grassland litter were sampled on the AquaDiva research site in the Hainich national park (Thuringia, Germany) and the Linde research station of the Zwillenberg Tietz foundation near M\u00e4rkisch Luch (Brandenburg, Germany). The plant litter sampling in Hainich was carried out with permission of the Hainich national park administration and in Linde with permission of the Zwillenberg Tietz foundation as the landowner. The Hainich site features near-neutral soil water (pH 6), whereas in the Linde site the soil water is more acidic (pH 4.9). The differences in pH arise due to carbonate buffering in the Hainich soil, which developed on a bedrock of marine carbonate sediments from the Triassic era<strong>[1]</strong>. In contrast, the Linde soil developed on siliciclastic material from the Weichselian Glaciation during the Pleistocene. Thus, our site replication covers a wide range of the natural pH-related variability in soil microbial community composition<strong>[2]</strong>, which has been suggested to affect the secondary metabolite profile of the plant.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Sampling procedure</strong></p><p>The plant litter was collected in October 2017 at both sites as soon as the start of litterfall was observed. Tree litter was collected from the forest floor at single-species stands in respective radii of\u2009~50&nbsp;m to account for very local variability in both forests. Grassland sites held a diverse community of grass and herb species, but only the dominant grass species were sampled. The sampling of both sites was completed within 2 consecutive days to achieve similarly minimal exposure of the litter to soil microbial communities. Care was taken to pick up only recently fallen litter from the top of the litter layer. After sampling, the material was transported to the lab and immediately dried at 40&nbsp;\u00b0C for 72&nbsp;h. As we cannot exclude that transport and drying might have reduced the potential for site-specific processes to occur, we checked the 16S taxonomic profiles of the litter both wet, directly from the forest, and after drying. They are summarized as dots Figure&nbsp;1c in the paper associated with this study and their close proximity indicates that transport and drying were only minor contributors to the overall variability.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Experimental setup</strong></p><p>The dried plant litter was coarsely cut and separately mixed with pre-combusted (500&nbsp;\u00b0C/5&nbsp;h) acid-washed sand at a ratio of 3&nbsp;g plant material per 100&nbsp;g final mixture to allow proper through flow of water. The sand and plant material mixtures were placed inside 250&nbsp;mL filter holders (Nalgene, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) above a GF/D (2.7&nbsp;\u00b5m) and a GF/F (0.7&nbsp;\u00b5m) glass fiber filter. Both filters were pre-combusted (500&nbsp;\u00b0C/5&nbsp;h) and the plastic filter holders were pre-autoclaved (121&nbsp;\u00b0C/20&nbsp;min). Sand and litter mixtures were set up in triplicate, resulting in 24 parallel decomposition setups (4 plant litter types from 2 sampling sites replicated 3x times). We set up 3 blanks containing only sand with no plant material, which were treated and sampled equally, showing no measurable TOC release or pH effect. The sand and litter mixtures were wetted with ultrapure water and checked daily for continuous wetness. After 2, 4, 8, 15 and 22&nbsp;days, 100&nbsp;mL of ultrapure water was added to leach DOM from the litter. During this time, prolonged periods of stagnant water were avoided by accelerating through flow using a soft vacuum of\u2009~500&nbsp;mbar for a maximum of 5 min. Immediately after the last leachate sampling, the sand and litter mixtures were sampled destructively into sterile falcon tubes for microbial community analysis.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Kohlhepp B, Lehmann R, Seeber P, K\u00fcsel K, Trumbore SE, Totsche KU.
