                "description": "<p>Cd248 has recently been associated with adipose tissue physiology, demonstrated by reduced weight gain in high fat diet-fed mice with genetic deletion of Cd248 relative to controls. Here we set out to determine the metabolic consequences of loss of Cd248. Strikingly, we find these to be sex specific; By subjecting Cd248-/- and Cd248+/+ mice to a high fat diet and indirect calorimetry study, we identified that only male Cd248-/- mice show reduced weight gain compared to littermate control wildtype mice. In addition, male (but not female) mice showed a lower respiratory exchange ratio on both chow and high fat diets, indicating a predisposition to metabolise lipid. Lipidomic studies on specific fat depots found reduced triglyceride and diglyceride deposition in male Cd248-/- mice, and this was supported by reduced expression of lipogenic and adipogenic genes. Finally, metabolomic analysis of isolated, differentiated preadipocytes found alterations in metabolic pathways associated with lipid deposition in cells isolated from male, but not female, Cd248-/- mice. Overall, our results highlight the importance of sex controls in animal studies and point to a role for Cd248 in sex- and depot-specific regulation of lipid metabolism.</p>",

Every effort has been made to present all data in accordance with the ARRIVE guidelines (NC3Rs). The generation and genotyping of Cd248-/- mice have been described previously<strong>[1]</strong>. Mice were subsequently backcrossed for &gt;10 generations onto a C57BL/6J background and confirmed by SNP analysis (Transnetyx Inc, Cordova). Genotyping was carried by Transnetyx Inc, Cordova. Mice were maintained on a 12 h light/dark cycle at 21 \u00b0C with ad libitum access to food and water. All mice were generated from CD248+/- x CD248+/- pairs. Mice were fed either a standard chow diet containing 10% kcal from fat, high in fibre containing complex carbohydrates (Special Diets Services U.K. RM3 (P) 801700), or a high fat diet containing 60% kcal from fat (Research Diets Inc, Rodent Diet With 60 kcal% Fat RD12492).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>High fat diet indirect calorimetry, weight gain and glucose tolerance study: </strong></p><p>Cohort breeding from Cd248 heterozygote (Cd248+/-) male and female pairs resulted in 7x Cd248+/+ male, 10x Cd248-/- male, 6x Cd248+/+ female and 7x Cd248-/- female mice. Results from all animals are included in the results (heterozygote offspring were not included in any experiments). From weaning (week 4) until week 8 mice were fed standard chow. From 8 weeks of age mice were fed high fat diet for a further 16 weeks (until 23 weeks of age). At the end of the experiment, mice were anaesthetised with isoflurane and a bolus serum blood sample obtained through cardiac puncture. Fat pads (inguinal, scapular, perirenal, gonadal) were collected, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 \u00b0C.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Preadipocyte extraction and cell culture: </strong></p><p>Preadipocytes were extracted from the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) of inguinal fat pads. Briefly, mice aged 8-12 weeks old were culled by cervical dislocation and fat pads dissected. Fat pads were finely minced, and collagenase digested (37 \u00b0C, 1 h with constant agitation). The resulting cell suspension was filtered to remove debris (70 \u03bcm pore size) and pelleted (300 g, 3 min) to separate mature adipocytes (which remain in the supernatant) from pelleted preadipocytes. Mature adipocytes and supernatant were discarded, whilst the SVF was resuspended in DMEM/F12 (Gibco, 10% FCS, 2 mM L-GLN, 100 U/ml Pen-Strep) and plated onto tissue culture plastic. Preadipocytes were used in experiments at passage 0.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Nanda A, Karim B, Peng Z, Liu G, Qiu W, Gan C, Vogelstein B, St Croix B, Kinzler KW, Huso DL.

The lipidomics data were normalized to the internal standard, EquiSPLASH (Avanti, Birmingham, AL, USA, SKU: 330731). The metabolomics data were normalized to total ion current (TIC). To remove the background noise, S/N threshold was set to 3. In addition, the lipids or metabolites with relative standard deviation (RSD) higher than 30% in the pooled QC samples were also removed. The data were analysed in <strong>R</strong> using both in-house and <strong>MetaboAnalyst</strong> scripts, followed by analysis in <strong>GraphPad Prism</strong> software. Significance was calculated either by t-test when only one comparison was made, or by ANOVA where multiple comparisons were made.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Sumner LW, Amberg A, Barrett D, Beale MH, Beger R, Daykin CA, Fan TW, Fiehn O, Goodacre R, Griffin JL, Hankemeier T, Hardy N, Harnly J, Higashi R, Kopka J, Lane AN, Lindon JC, Marriott P, Nicholls AW, Reily MD, Thaden JJ, Viant MR.
