                "description": "<p>Na\u00efve human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) that resemble the pre-implantation epiblasts are fueled by a combination of aerobic glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, but their mitochondrial regulators are poorly understood. Here we report that, proline dehydrogenase (PRODH), a mitochondria-localized proline metabolism enzyme, is dramatically upregulated in na\u00efve hESCs compared to their primed counterparts. The upregulation of PRODH is induced by a reduction in c-Myc expression that is dependent on PD0325901, a MEK inhibitor routinely present in naive hESC culture media. PRODH knockdown in naive hESCs significantly promoted mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (mtOXPHOS) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production that triggered autophagy, DNA damage, and apoptosis. Remarkably, MitoQ, a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant, effectively restored the pluripotency and proliferation of PRODH-knockdown na\u00efve hESCs, indicating that PRODH maintains na\u00efve pluripotency by preventing excessive ROS production. Concomitantly, PRODH knockdown significantly slowed down the proteolytic degradation of multiple key mitochondrial electron transport chain complex proteins. Thus, we revealed a crucial role of PRODH in limiting mtOXPHOS and ROS production, and thereby safeguarding na\u00efve pluripotency of hESCs.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Untargeted metabolomics</strong> - H9N PLKO.1 vs H9P PLKO.1 / H9P shPRODH vs H9P PLKO.1 / H9N shPRODH vs H9N PLKO.1 - is reported in the current study <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS7840' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS7840</strong></a>.</p><p><strong>Targeted metabolomics</strong> (amino acids and derivatives) - H9P (Primed) VS H9N (Na\u00efve) - is reported in <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS7832' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS7832</strong></a>.</p>",

Where appropriate, hESCs were treated with Cycloheximide (CHX) (Sigma-Aldrich, 239763M), MG132 (Sigma-Aldrich, M7449), PD0325901 (ABCR, AB253775), L-proline (Aladdin, P108709), MitoQ (MedChemExpress, HY-100116A) either individually or in combination with the indicated concentrations.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Primed and RSet Feeder-Free (Rset) na\u00efve hESC culture</strong></p><p>To avoid any potential confounding effects by irradiated mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) feeder layers, hESCs used in this study were grown in feeder-free conditions. According to the manufacturer's instructions, primed hESCs were cultivated on Matrigel-coated tissue culture dishes (Corning, 354277) and kept alive in mTeSR1 medium (StemCell Technologies, 85850) at 37 \u00b0C and 5% O2. Medium change was performed on a daily basis. Cells were passaged every 3/4 days using 0.02% EDTA incubated for 5 min at 37 \u00b0C (Cienry, E6511). In RSeT Feeder-Free (Rset) medium, primed hESCs were transformed into naive-like hESCs by following the instructions provided by the manufacturer (StemCell Technologies, 05975). Thereafter, the culture medium was changed every 2 days, and na\u00efve-like hESCs were passaged using TrypLE (Thermo Fisher, 12605010).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>PXGL na\u00efve hESC culture</strong></p><p>Conversion of primed hESCs to naive hESCs in the PXGL medium was achieved following the protocol previously published<strong>[1][2]</strong>. After initial passages on MEF, stabilized cells can then be maintained on Geltrex (growth factor-reduced, Thermo Fisher, A1413302) and dissociated with TrypLE. After plating the cell suspension, add 1 \u03bcL/cm^2 of Geltrex immediately to each well and gently shake to mix it all together. Y-27632, a ROCK inhibitor, was introduced during replating. Cells were fed with new PXGL media every 2 days. Cells can be split every 5 days at a ratio of 1:3 and cryopreserved using CryoStor CS10 (StemCell Technologies, 07930).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Untargeted metabolomics</strong></p><p>For untargeted metabolomics - H9N PLKO.1 vs H9P PLKO.1 / H9P shPRODH vs H9P PLKO.1 / H9N shPRODH vs H9N PLKO.1, the collected samples were thawed on ice and metabolite was extracted with 50% methanol buffer.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Bredenkamp N, Stirparo GG, Nichols J, Smith A, Guo G.

LC-MS raw data files were converted into mzXML format and then processed by the XCMS, CAMERA and metaX<strong>[1]</strong> toolbox implemented with the R software. Each ion was identified by combining retention time (RT) and m/z data. Intensities of each peak were recorded and a 3D matrix containing arbitrarily assigned peak indices (retention time-m/z pairs), sample names (observations) and ion intensity information (variables) was generated. The intensity of peak data was further preprocessed by metaX<strong>[1]</strong>. Those features detected in less than 50% of QC samples or 80% of biological samples were removed, and the remaining peaks with missing values were imputed with the k-nearest neighbor algorithm to improve the data quality further. PCA was performed for outlier detection and batch effects evaluation using the pre-processed dataset. Quality control-based robust LOESS signal correction was fitted to the QC data with respect to the order of injection to minimize signal intensity drift over time. In addition, the relative standard deviations of the metabolic features were calculated across all QC samples, and those &gt; 30% were then removed. Based on KEGG and manual selection, the dataset was further refined by excluding all metabolites that are of non-human origins and that are unlikely to be associated with human embryonic developmental stage. Student\u2019 t-tests were conducted to detect differences in metabolite concentrations between phenotypes. The P-value was adjusted for multiple tests using an FDR (Benjamini-Hochberg). The VIP value was calculated. A VIP cut-off value of 1.0 was used to select important features.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Li Y, Fang J, Qi X, Lin M, Zhong Y, Sun L, Cui W.
