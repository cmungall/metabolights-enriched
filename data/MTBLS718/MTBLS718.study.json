                "description": "<p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> There is a critical need for rapid viral infection diagnostics to enable prompt case identification in pandemic settings and support targeted antimicrobial prescribing.</p><p><strong>METHODS:</strong> Using untargeted high-resolution liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry, we compared the admission serum metabolome of emergency department patients with acute viral infections, including COVID-19, bacterial infections, inflammatory conditions and healthy controls. Sera from an independent cohort of emergency department patients admitted with viral or bacterial infections underwent profiling to validate findings. Associations between whole-blood gene expression and the identified metabolite of interest were examined.</p><p><strong>FINDINGS:</strong> 3'-Deoxy-3',4'-didehydro-cytidine (ddhC), a free base of the only known human antiviral small molecule ddhC-triphosphate (ddhCTP), was detected for the first time in serum. When comparing 60 viral with 101 non-viral cases in the discovery cohort, ddhC was the most differentially abundant metabolite, generating an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.954 (95% CI: 0.923-0.986). In the validation cohort, ddhC was again the most significantly differentially abundant metabolite when comparing 40 viral with 40 bacterial cases, generating an AUC of 0.81 (95% CI: 0.708-0.915). Transcripts of viperin and <em>CMPK2</em>, enzymes responsible for ddhCTP synthesis, were amongst the 5 genes most highly correlated with ddhC abundance.</p><p><strong>CONCLUSIONS: </strong>The antiviral precursor molecule ddhC is detectable in serum and an accurate marker for acute viral infection. Interferon-inducible genes, viperin and <em>CMPK2</em> are implicated in ddhC production <em>in vivo</em>. These findings highlight a future diagnostic role for ddhC in viral diagnosis, pandemic preparedness and acute infection management.</p><p><strong>FUNDING:</strong> National Institute for Health Research Imperial Biomedical Research Centre; Medical Research Council.</p>",

ICHNT patients were admitted via one of the different emergency departments. In the validation cohort, patient serum samples were obtained from the University College London Hospital (UCLH) Trust arm of BioAID from 30th April 2014 to 20th July 2021.</p><p><br></p><p>In both discovery and validation cohorts, patients were recruited to BioAID if they had a suspected clinical infection syndrome of sufficient severity, as assessed by a clinician, to warrant blood culture testing. Blood samples were obtained at the point of admission, alongside microbial isolates identified during the inpatient stay, in conjunction with demographic and clinical data. Ethical approval was obtained to take deferred consent from patients (or next of kin/nominated consultee) to retain blood samples, including serum and RNA specimens, as well as clinical data (South Central \u2013 Oxford C Research Ethics Committee [REC] references 14/SC/0008 and 19/SC/0116)<strong>[1]</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p>In the discovery cohort, patients were retrospectively identified as part of the Microbial Products in Infection protocol where a pathogen of interest \u2013 in this study, SARS-CoV-2 \u2013 was identified to the research team by the routine diagnostic laboratory. Serum samples obtained at the point of admission were linked to anonymised patient data provided by an NHS clinician including age, sex, timing of sample in relation to illness onset, survival/death, ICU admission, duration of stay and blood test results. (West London REC reference 06/Q0406/20). Demographics for all patients are reported in <strong>Table S1</strong> in the paper associated with this study.</p><p><br></p><p>In both BioAID and Microbial Products in Infection, all serum samples were taken in the same manner at the point of patient admission to hospital, prior to any intervention, as part of usual clinical care. Following routine diagnostic testing, surplus volumes were retrieved from the diagnostic laboratory where they had been stored at 4 \u00b0C, and transferred to a -80 \u00b0C freezer within 5 day (d) of sample acquisition. During the peaks of the UK COVID-19 pandemic, owing to unprecedented pressures placed on laboratory staffing, transfer to -80 \u00b0C of serum samples from n=80 COVID-19 patients was delayed to between 6-30 d from sample acquisition. These samples were classified into a separate sub-group and were not used in the discovery primary analysis to avoid confounding bias. Control serum samples from consenting healthy donors were from an approved subcollection (MED_SS_12_023) of the Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust Biomedical Research Council (ICHT BRC) Tissue Bank (Wales REC3 17/WA/0161).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Discovery cohort patient selection</strong></p><p>Serum samples from patients in one of the following 6 categories were used in the discovery cohort: culture-confirmed Gram-positive bacteraemia, culture-confirmed Gram-negative bacteraemia, PCR-confirmed viral infection prior to detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the UK (January 2020), PCR-confirmed COVID-19, non-infected patients and healthy controls.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>N=24 samples in each of 2 comparator groups were required to achieve a power of &gt;90% to identify an AUC of at least 0.8, at a significance level of 0.01. Thus to enable all comparisons, accounting for potential sample exclusion (e.g. assay failure, poor data quality), we used n=30 samples in each clinical group apart from COVID-19, where we included all available samples (n=112) to facilitate exploration of severity differences in this cohort. Infection categories were assigned using electronic diagnostic pathology data pertaining to admission only and confirmed by a clinician. Non-infected patients were identified from the database where there was no positive microbial diagnostic test and no infection-related ICD-10 diagnostic code from BioAID admission. Sera from n=13 healthy controls were available from a subcollection of the ICHT BRC Tissue Bank.</p><p><br></p><p>To facilitate multi-omic comparison, serum samples from BioAID patients were prioritised if whole-blood RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) had already been undertaken as part of an earlier study, where samples had been selected from the BioAID database using a random number generator<strong>[2]</strong>. Sera from additional BioAID patients were selected randomly from within individual infection groups using a random number generator in Excel.</p><p><br></p><p>Bacteraemic patients were excluded if the isolated bacterium was deemed a contaminant, or if the blood culture was taken &gt;24 h prior to/post the admission serum sample. COVID-19 patients were excluded if their positive PCR test was taken &gt;10 d prior to admission, or &gt;2 d post admission, to avoid non-COVID-19 related admissions and hospital-acquired COVID-19, respectively. Microbiologically confirmed co-infections across different infection classes were excluded.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Validation cohort patient selection</strong></p><p>In the validation cohort, we compared 2 patient groups: bacteraemic and viral. Based on discovery data, to achieve a power of &gt;90% to identify an AUC of 0.75, at a significance level of 0.01, we required 36 patients in each group. Accounting for potential sample exclusion, we used n=40 samples in each group, selected from the UCLH BioAID database using a random number generator in Excel. For all patients, the same inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied as in the discovery cohort.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Metabolic profiling assays</strong></p><p>Serum samples from 245 patients in the discovery cohort and 80 patients in the validation cohort were analysed using UPLC-MS following previously described analytical and quality control (QC) procedures<strong>[3]</strong>. A suite of chromatographic separations was used in the discovery cohort, each coupled with high resolution time of flight mass spectrometry, to maximise coverage of a broad range of metabolite and lipid classes. Hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) was used for the separation of hydrophilic analytes (e.g. polar and charged metabolites), while reversed-phase chromatography (RPC) was used for the separation of lipophilic analytes to profile complex and neutral lipid species<strong>[4]</strong>. Each RPC LC-MS assay was conducted in both negative and positive ionisation modes, producing lipid RPC- and lipid RPC+ datasets. The HILIC LC-MS assay was conducted in the positive ionisation mode only, producing the HILIC+ dataset. In the validation cohort, only the HILIC+ assay was undertaken. The final datasets contained the following number of variables: Lipid RPC-, 521; Lipid RPC+, 2257; HILIC+, 1572 (discovery) / 1194 (validation).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Shallcross LJ, Mentzer A, Rahman S, Cooke GS, Sriskandan S, Noursadeghi M.

                        "description": "<p>An in-house <strong>R </strong>script was used to collate all LC-MS features in the discovery cohort with peak elution profiles (extracted ion chromatograms) highly correlated to that of the feature identified as a discriminator for viral infections (m/z of 248.0647 and retention time of 1.96 min), revealing the putative mass spectrum of the metabolite biomarker comprising 5 features. The original feature m/z 248.0647 was assigned as the [M+Na]+ ion species, and the 4 associated features were assigned as the first isotope of [M+Na]+ ion at m/z 249.0676, [M+H]+ at m/z 226.0827, [M+K]+ at m/z 264.0383 and an in-source fragment at m/z 112.0517. Targeted extraction of the four associated features, each absent from the XCMS profiling dataset owing to non-detection, was performed using <strong>peakPantheR</strong> software and preprocessed as described above for the XCMS profiling dataset<strong>[1]</strong>. Each associated feature gave comparable individual AUC to the [M+Na]+ ion species identified from analysis of the profiling data (AUC 0.954) when comparing viral versus all other groups (<strong>Table S1</strong> in the paper associated with this study).</p><p><br></p><p>The molecular formula of the metabolite of interest was determined to be C9H11N3O4 by elemental composition of the [M+H]+ ion species utilising accurate mass and observed isotope distribution. Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) utilising collision induced dissociation (CID) was performed on both the [M+H]+ and [M+Na]+ ion species, revealing the fragmentation patterns illustrated in <strong>Figure S1</strong> in the paper associated with this study.</p><p><br></p><p>The experimental MS/MS spectrum for the [M+H]+ ion species (m/z 226.0827) revealed the loss of one and two water moieties (m/z 208.072 and m/z 190.062, respectively) and the fragment with m/z 112.05 consistent with cytosine ([M+H]+). The experimental MS/MS spectrum for the [M+Na]+ ion species (m/z 248.0647) revealed analogous species.</p><p><br></p><p>No matches were found for these spectra in databases - <strong>HMDB[2]</strong>, <strong>METLIN [3]</strong>, <strong>NIST17[4]</strong> and <strong>Mass Bank of North America</strong> (<a href='http://massbank.us/' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>http://massbank.us/</a>). However, the apparent presence of a cytosine fragment led to the hypothesis that the metabolite of interest was a nucleoside previously reported in the literature \u2013 3'-Deoxy-3',4'-didehydro-cytidine (ddhC), a free base of the antiviral ribonucleotide 3'-Deoxy-3',4'-didehydro-cytidine triphosphate<strong>[5]</strong>. The experimental MS/MS spectrum of [M+H]+ obtained in our study samples matched the previously published fragmentation pattern of natural ddhC detected in cell lysates of <em>E. coli</em> and authentic chemical standard of ddhC<strong>[6]</strong>. The HILIC method used for MS/MS analysis was the same as that used in the profiling method with the same MS source conditions<strong>[7]</strong>. MS/MS target selection was performed using unit mass selection via quadrupole with a collision energy voltage ramp of 10-45 V.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, the structure of metabolite was definitively identified by analysing a chemical reference standard of ddhC (acquired from Berry &amp; Associates) in parallel with the study samples, using the HILIC profiling method and MS/MS to match chromatographic retention time and fragmentation spectrum, respectively (<strong>Figure S2</strong> in the paper associated with this study). For the former, a spike-in technique was used, where the pooled serum sample was mixed with different concentrations of the ddhC chemical standard (2.5, 5 and 10 ng/mL).</p><p><br></p><p>For the validation cohort, the identification of ddhC was based on the same m/z and similar retention time to that observed in the discovery data.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Wolfer AM, Correia GDS, Sands CJ, Camuzeaux S, Yuen AHY, Chekmeneva E, Tak\u00e1ts Z, Pearce JTM, Lewis MR. peakPantheR, an R package for large-scale targeted extraction and integration of annotated metabolic features in LC-MS profiling datasets.
