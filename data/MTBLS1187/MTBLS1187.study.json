                "description": "Bread aroma is the principal characteristic perceived by the consumer yet it is mostly\ndisregarded in the product chain. The main aim of this study was to evaluate the potential to\ninclude bread aroma as a new target criterion into the wheat product chain. The objectives\nof our study were to (i) quantify the influence of genetic versus environmental factors on\nthe bread aroma and quality characteristics, (ii) evaluate whether bread baked from modern\nwheat varieties differ in terms of aroma from those baked from old varieties and (iii) compare\ngenomic and metabolomic approaches for their efficiency to predict bread aroma and quality\ncharacteristics in a wheat breeding program. Agronomic characters as well as bread aroma and\nquality traits were assessed for 18 old and 22 modern winter wheat varieties evaluated at up to\nthree locations in Germany. Metabolite profiles of all 120 flour samples were collected using a\n7200 GC-QTOF. Considerable differences in the adjusted entry means for all examined bread\naroma and quality characters were observed. For aroma, which was rated on a scale from 1 to\n9, the adjusted entry means varied for the 40 wheat varieties between 3 and 8. In contrast,\nthe aroma of bread prepared from old and modern wheat varieties did not differ significantly\n(P<0.05). Bread aroma was not significantly (P<0.05) correlated with grain yield, which\nsuggested that it is possible to select for the former character in wheat breeding programs\nwithout reducing the gain of selection for the latter. Finally, we have shown that bread aroma\ncan be better predicted using a combination of metabolite and SNP genotyping profiles instead\nof the SNP genotyping profile only. In conclusion, we have illustrated possibilities to increase\nthe quality of wheat for consumers in the product chain.",

A total of 18 old (year of release 1962-1999) and 22 modern (2005-2014) winter wheat varieties were used for this study. All varieties (i.e. genotypes) have been cultivated in the season 2015/16 in 5 m2 plots in Germany at o=3 locations. Two locations were located in Baden-Wuerttemberg, namely Hohenheim(HOH) and Ihinger Hof (IHO), as well as at Gatersleben (GAL) in Saxony-Anhalt. The experimental design was an incomplete block design with one replication per location. At each location, days to heading (HD), plant height (PH), and yield (YD) were assessed.</p>",

Chromatography was performed using a 7890B GC system (Agilent Technologies) with a HP-5MS column with 5% phenyl methyl siloxane film (Agilent 19091S-433, 30 m length, 0.25 mm internal diameter, 0.25 \u00b5M film). The oven temperature was held constant at 70 \u00b0C for 2 min and then ramped at 12.5 \u00b0C/min to 320 \u00b0C at which it was held constant for 5 min; resulting in a total run time of 27 mins.</p>",

For relative quantification, aggregated fragment intensities of the compounds were normalized to the aggregated fragment intensities of the internal standard ribitol (Sigma-Aldrich) which was added to the extraction buffer. Aggregation by calculating the average after maximum scaling each fragment over the samples to 100% was performed after evaluating each fragments uniqueness and their linearity. Mass spectral annotation was manually supervised using the Golm Metabolome Database mass-spectral library (http://gmd.mpimp-golm.mpg.de/download/) after conversion of absolute time into Retention Indices. Analytes corresponding to contaminations were removed. Furthermore, if several analytes from the same metabolite were identified, the one with the higher heritability, for which the calculation is described below, was retained.</p><p><br></p><p>Ref:</p><p>[1] Luedemann A, Strassburg K, Erban A, Kopka J.
