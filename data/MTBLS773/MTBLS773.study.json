                "description": "INTRODUCTION: Blackcurrant (Ribes nigrum L.) is an excellent example of a \u201csuper fruit\u201d with potential health benefits. Both genotype and cultivation environment are known to affect the chemical composition of blackcurrant, especially ascorbic acid and various phenolic compounds. Environmental conditions, like temperature, solar radiation and precipitation can also have significant impact on fruit chemical composition. The relevance of the study is further accentuated by the predicted and ongoing changes in global climate. </br> OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to provide new knowledge and a deeper understanding of the effects of post flowering environmental conditions, namely temperature and day length, on fruit quality and chemical composition of blackcurrant using an untargeted high performance liquid chromatography\u2013photo diode array\u2013mass spectrometry (HPLC\u2013PDA\u2013MS) metabolomics approach. </br> METHODS: A phytotron experiment with cultivation of single-stemmed potted plants of blackcurrant cv. Narve Viking was conducted using constant temperatures of 12, 18 or 24 \u00b0C and three different photoperiods (short day, short day with night interruption, and natural summer daylight conditions). Plants were also grown under ambient outdoor conditions. Ripe berries were analysed using an untargeted HPLC\u2013PDA\u2013MS metabolomics approach to detect the presence and concentration of molecules as affected by controlled climatic factors. </br> RESULTS: The untargeted metabolomics dataset contained a total of 7274 deconvolved retention time-m/z pairs across both electrospray ionisation (ESI) positive and negative polarities, from which 549 metabolites were identified or minimally annotated based upon accurate mass MS. Conventional principal component analysis (PCA) in combination with the Friedman significance test were applied to first identify which metabolites responded to temperature in a linear fashion. Multi-block hierarchical PCA in combination with the Friedman significance test was secondly applied to identify metabolites that were responsive to different day length conditions. Temperature had significant effect on a total of 365 metabolites representing a diverse range of chemical classes. It was observed that ripening of the blackcurrant berries under ambient conditions, compared to controlled conditions, resulted in an increased accumulation of 34 annotated metabolites, mainly anthocyanins and flavonoids. 18 metabolites were found to be regulated differentially under the different daylength conditions. Moreover, based upon the most abundant anthocyanins, a comparison between targeted and untargeted analyses, revealed a close convergence of the two analytical methods. Therefore, the study not just illustrates the value of non-targeted metabolomics approaches with respect to the huge diversity and numbers of significantly changed metabolites detected (and which would be missed by conventional targeted analyses), but also shows the validity of the non-targeted approach with respect to its precision compared to targeted analyses. </br> CONCLUSIONS: Blackcurrant maturation under controlled ambient conditions revealed a number of insightful relationships between environment and chemical composition of the fruit. A prominent reduction of the most abundant anthocyanins under the highest temperature treatments indicated that blackcurrant berries in general may accumulate lower total anthocyanins in years with extreme hot summer conditions. HPLC\u2013PDA\u2013MS metabolomics is an excellent method for broad analysis of chemical composition of berries rich in phenolic compounds. Moreover, the experiment in controlled phytotron conditions provided additional knowledge concerning plant interactions with the environment.",

Both treatments 1 and 3 were perceived as long day conditions by the plants, but the former also provided a 9% larger daily light integral (total daily photosynthetic active radiation). On the other hand, by using low intensity incandescent lamps for the night interruption (approximately 7 \u03bcmol quanta/m^2/s), the daily light integral varied by less than 0.5% between treatments 2 and 3, which represent the true photoperiodic test. Plants were also grown outdoors in pots (as a control) under ambient summer conditions (59\u00b040\u2032N).\n</p>\nBerries were harvested when fully ripe as judged by berry softness and visual assessment of colour. Berries from one cluster were harvested from the mid-part of 2 plants into a 50 ml tube and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C.\n</p>\nThe experiment design was fully factorial with a split-plot design, with temperatures as main plots and photoperiod as a subplot. The experiment was replicated with 4 randomised blocks, each comprising 2 blackcurrant plants on a separate trolley, giving 8 plants per treatment.\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Woznicki TL, Heida OM, S\u00f8nsteby A, Wold A-B, Fagertun Remberg S.

Mass spectra were primarily collected in full scan mode (m/z 100-2000) at a mass resolution of 30,000 (FWHM defined at m/z 400) within the FT detector for all samples.\n</p>\n2 further methods were applied to obtain ion trees by performing data-dependent analysis (DDA) at MS2 and MS3 levels for the mixed QA samples.\n</p>\nThe first method applied a primary full scan event within the FT, followed by a secondary scan event within the LTQ-IT to collect MS2 CID fragmentation spectra for the top 3 most intense ions as defined within the preliminary full MS scan.\n</p>\nThe second method was identical, but applied a further tertiary MS scan event where the top 3 most intense ions detected in each MS2 spectrum, were taken forward for further CID fragmentation and MS3 collection within the LTQ-IT.\n</p>\nHelium was applied as a collision gas for CID at a normalised collision energy of 45%, a trapping window width of 2 (+/- 1) m/z was applied, an activation time of 30 ms and activation Q of 0.25 were applied, only singly charged ions were selected for DDA, isotopic ions were also excluded.\n</p>\nThe preliminary full scan event within the FT generated 'profile' mode spectral data, whereas the LTQ-IT MS2 and MS3 data were collected in \u2018centroid\u2019 mode. To obtain MS2 and MS3 data for as broad range of ions as possible, the DDA MS2 and MS3 methods can be applied several times over restricted mass ranges (e.g. 100-500 m/z; 500-1000 m/z;1000-2000 m/z).\n</p>\nA scan speed of 0.1 s and 0.4 s were apllied in the LTQ-IT and FT-MS respectively. The Automatic Gain Control was set to 1 x 10^5 and 1 x 10^6 for the LTQ-IT and FT-MS respectively.\n</p>\nPrior to the analytical run the LTQ-IT and FT-MS were calibrated with the manufacturers recomended calibration mixture and procedures.\n</p>\nThe following settings were applied to ESI: Spray voltage -3.5 kV (ESI-) and +4.5 kV (ESI+); Sheath gas 60; Aux gas 30; Capilary voltage -35 V (ESI-) +35 V (ESI+); Tube lens voltage -100 V (ESI-) and +100 V (ESI+); Capilary temperture 280 \u00b0C; ESI probe temperature 100 \u00b0C.\n</p>\nFor the first 2 minutes of analysis the eluent flow was directed to waste, whereas from 2-29 min the eluent was directed to the MS detector, before being directed back to waste between 29-35 min.\n</p>\nThe samples were analysed in a completely randomised order as 2 independent analytical blocks respective of ESI positive and ESI negative polarities. For each analytical block, initially 8 injections of QA sample were performed for LC-MS system conditioning, after which 3 further injections of QA sample were performed, followed by 5-6 injections of experimental samples and a further QA injection. This was repeated until all samples were analysed, finally the analytical block was concluded with a further 2 QA injections. A control blank sample was analysed at the start and end of the analytical block, which was finally concluded by collection of the DDA MS2 and MS3 profiles.",
