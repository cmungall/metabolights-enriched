                "description": "Lipid metabolism is an essential component in reproductive physiology. While lipid mobilization has been implicated in the growth of Plasmodium falciparum malaria parasites in their Anopheles vectors, the role of this process in the reproductive biology of these mosquitoes remains elusive. Here, we show that impairing lipolysis in Anopheles gambiae, the major malaria vectors, leads to embryonic lethality. Embryos derived from females in which we silenced the triglyceride lipase AgTL2 or the lipid storage droplet AgLSD1 develop normally during early embryogenesis but fail to hatch. These embryos show severely impaired metabolism and appear to have compromised neuronal functions. Embryonic lethality is efficiently recapitulated by exposing adult females to broad-spectrum lipase inhibitors prior to blood feeding, unveiling lipolysis as a novel target for inducing mosquito sterility. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into the importance of maternal lipid mobilization in embryonic health that could potentially inform studies on human reproduction.",
