                "description": "<p>Metabolic reprogramming in malignant cells is a hallmark of cancer that relies on augmented glycolytic metabolism to support their growth, invasion and metastasis. However, the impact of global adipose metabolism on tumor growth and the drug development by targeting adipose metabolism remain largely unexplored. Here we show that a therapeutic paradigm of drugs is effective for treating various cancer types by browning adipose tissues. Mirabegron, a clinically available drug for overactive bladders, displays potent anticancer effects in various animal cancer models, including untreatable cancers such as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma, via the browning of adipose tissues. Genetic deletion of the uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), a key thermogenic protein in adipose tissues, ablates the anticancer effect. Similarly, the removal of brown adipose tissue (BAT), which is responsible for non-shivering thermogenesis, attenuates the anticancer activity of mirabegron. These findings demonstrate that mirabegron represents a paradigm of anticancer drugs with a distinct mechanism for the effective treatment of multiple cancers.</p>",

Tumor sizes were measured with a caliper and tumor volumes were calculated according to the standard formula (length x width^2 x 0.52)<strong>[3]</strong>. For the genetic spontaneous intestinal adenoma model, ApcMin/+ mice, that usually developed multiple intestinal adenomas between weeks 10 and 14, were used. All tumor sizes were \u2264\u20092.5\u2009cm^3 and did not exceed the maximal tumor size allowed by the ethical approval. Fresh tissues including tumors and adipose depots were harvested and kept in dry ice or liquid nitrogen for metabolomics analysis or RNA and protein extraction. A portion of fresh tissues was fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) (MA0192, Meilunbio, China) overnight for histological and immunohistochemical analyses.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Drug treatment</strong></p><p>Mirabegron (223673-61-8, BOC sciences, USA) was dissolved in polyethylene glycol (PEG, 91893, Sigma-Aldrich) as a 100 mg/mL stock, which was further diluted in PBS upon use. Mirabegron was orally administrated in each mouse at 0.8, 3.2, 8 and 10 mg/kg bodyweight/day until mice were sacrificed for further analysis. CL-316, 243 (1499, Tocris Bioscience, USA) was injected into each mouse at 1 mg/kg bodyweight/day. Isoproterenol (HY-B0468, MedChemExpress, USA) was injected into each mouse at 1 mg/kg bodyweight/day. Propranolol (HY-B0573B, MedChemExpress, USA) was injected into each mouse at 2 mg/kg bodyweight/day. L-748,337 (HY-103211, MedChemExpress, USA) and SR59230A (HY-100672, MedChemExpress, USA) were injected into each mouse at 5 mg/kg bodyweight/day. Drugs were given to tumor-bearing mice after 14 days of tumor implantation when tumor size reached approximately 0.2 cm^3.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Yang Y, Andersson P, Hosaka K, Zhang Y, Cao R, Iwamoto H, Yang X, Nakamura M, Wang J, Zhuang R, Morikawa H, Xue Y, Braun H, Beyaert R, Samani N, Nakae S, Hams E, Dissing S, Fallon PG, Langer R, Cao Y.

Mass spectra of these metabolic features were identified by databases including Human metabolome database (HMDB) (http://www.hmdb.ca/) and Metlin database (https://metlin.scripps.edu/). For metabolites having MS/MS confirmation, only the ones with MS/MS fragments score above 30 were considered as confidently identified. Statistical analysis was performed using ropls&nbsp;v1.6.2 (http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ropls.html) R package from Bioconductor on Majorbio Cloud Platform (https://cloud.majorbio.com). Unsupervised principal component analysis (PCA), orthogonal partial least squares discriminate analysis (OPLS-DA), variable importance in the projection (VIP) and differential metabolites analysis were performed.&nbsp;Metabolites were further mapped into their biochemical pathways through metabolic enrichment and pathway analysis based on the KEGG database (http://www. genome.jp/kegg/).</p>",
