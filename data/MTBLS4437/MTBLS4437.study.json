                "description": "Metabolomics is a modern tool that aids in our understanding of the molecular changes in organisms. Archaeological science is a branch of archaeology that explores different archaeological materials using modern analytical tools. Human osteoarchaeological material are a frequent finding in archaeological contexts and have the potential to offer information about previous human populations, which can be illuminating about our current condition. Using a set of samples comprising different skeletal elements and bone structures, here we explore for the first time the possibility of extracting metabolites from osteoarchaeological material. Here, a protocol for extraction and measurement of extracted polar and less-polar/apolar metabolites by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography hyphenated to high resolution mass spectrometry is presented to measure the molecules separated after a reversed phase and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography column. Molecular information was obtained, showing that osteoarchaeological material is a viable source of molecular information for metabolomic studies.",

                        "description": "<p><strong>Osteoarchaeological samples:</strong></p><p>For the purposes of this research, we used 2 skeletal collections. The first was material from the Medieval Hospital of St John's the Evangelist in Cambridge. This institute was set up at the end of the 12th century to care for the poor and sick of the town. It closed in the 16th century when the buildings passed over to what is now St John\u2019s College, Cambridge. As such, all material predates the use of tobacco and tobacco pipes in the UK. From this collection, we used disarticulated humeri, femora, and tibiae. The second collection utilised consisted of 18th-19th century individuals buried at the former site of Coventry Cathedral (St Mary\u2019s). This establishment would have served the local community and can be regarded as a parish, although it is likely that people were better off than average. From this collection we sampled femora, ribs, and first and second metatarsals (see <strong>Figures S1, S2, and Table 1</strong> in the paper associated with this study). More detail and references on the sites can be found in the Supplementary Information of aforementioned paper.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Dry cleaning process for human osteoarchaeological samples:</strong></p><p>All bones were subject to a soft, dry cleaning to facilitate osteoarchaeological inspection and guarantee the non-introduction of possible non-biological material when sampling the bones. The dry-cleaning process was conducted in a clean fume-cabinet by polishing the bone\u2019s surface with a finishing abrasive-buffwheel adapted to a Dremel rotatory tool operated at 5.000 RPM. The process was performed until all non-biological material was imperceptible. The procedure was carried out without extra pressure on the surface of the bone, avoiding any damage. Detached residues\u2013soil/dust\u2013were collected and properly discarded.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Micro-sampling of cortical bone structures in human osteoarchaeological samples:</strong></p><p>The micro-sampling of cortical bone from the different skeletal elements was performed in a clean fume cabinet as follows: <strong>1)</strong> A circular mark to delineate the sampling area in the region of interest of each bone was made by using a 6.4 mm diameter glass drilling bit attached to a rotatory tool operated at 5000 RPM. Femora were sampled in a region located 10 mm below (inferior to) the midshaft on the anterior surface. This location was chosen to avoid the entheses and measurement points of the posterior area; other bones were sampled at the middle of the total length on the anterior surface. <strong>2)</strong> The periosteal bone surface of the marked area was micro-drilled using a high-speed cutter accessory of 4.8 mm diameter attached to a rotatory tool operated at a speed between 5000 to 10000 RPM. Drilling continued until the inner cortical bone (~1-2 mm in depth) was exposed. Removed bone was collected and properly discarded. <strong>3)</strong> Exposed cortical bone was drilled, as in step 2, until the mass required for the metabolomics experiments was obtained. Care was taken to avoid sampling the endosteal surface or drilling outside of the marked area. Cortical bone samples were collected and stored in an empty labelled 1.5 ml plastic tube. Biological replicates (triplicates) were extracted for a third of the individuals. Micro-sampling of cortical bone creates a perforation of 6 mm in diameter and variable depth in the skeletal element (see <strong>Figure S1</strong> in the paper associated with this study). As reference, a single area sampled in a femur will result in approximately 75 mg of cortical bone.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Micro-sampling of trabecular bone structures in human osteoarchaeological samples:</strong></p><p>Micro-sampling of trabecular bone for the different bones was performed in a clean fume-cabinet as follows: <strong>1)</strong> The medullary cavity of the bone was exposed in the region of interest. Tibiae, and first and second metatarsals were micro-drilled in the distal areas with a high-speed cutter accessory of 4.8 mm attached to a rotatory tool operated at 5000 RPM, removing the cortical layers, which were collected and properly discarded. Femora were micro-drilled with a glass drilling bit of 6.4 mm in diameter attached to a rotatory tool and operated at 10000 RPM, removing a complete transversal section of the bone (see <strong>Figure 2</strong> of the paper associated with this study) at the distal-posterior surface within the intercondylar fossa, i.e. over the planum popliteum. The trabecular area of the ribs was already exposed due to fragmentation, these bones being selected for post-excavation fractures. <strong>2)</strong> The exposed medullary cavity was carved with a spiral cutting bit attached to the rotatory tool operated at 5000 RPM. Gentle drilling was performed until the total mass required for the metabolomic measurements was achieved, taking care to not affect any other bone structure in the process. Resultant trabecular bone samples were collected and stored in empty labelled 1.5 m plastic tubes. Biological replicates (triplicates) were obtained for a third of the individuals by increasing the total amount of trabecular bone carved and splitting it later. Micro-sampling of trabecular bone leaves a hole of 6 mm diameter, with the marrow channel exposed (see <strong>Figure S1</strong> of the paper associated with this study). Total mass obtained by micro-sampling of trabecular bone varies depending on the individual, skeletal element sampled, and carving time. As reference, sampling of an average femur could lead to more than 100 mg of trabecular bone, with a carving time of less than 10 s.</p>",

The RP gradient elution program started running at 2% B, held for 1 min, then mobile phase B was linearly increased to 20% to min 5, 25% in min 6, 75% in min 7, and 98% in min 7.5, then held at 98% of B until min 8, going back to initial conditions of 98% of A in min 9, and equilibrated the column until min 10. The HILIC gradient elution program started running at 3% A and held for 1 min, then mobile phase A was linearly increased to 20% in 3 min, 25% in 1 min, 75% in 2 min, and 97% in 1 min, then was held for half a min, going back to initial conditions of 97% of B in 1.5 min to later be equilibrated for 4 min.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Untargeted metabolic fingerprinting by nano-UHPLC-Orbitrap-HRMS/MS:</strong></p><p>These analyses were performed using a Dionex Ultimate 3000 NCS-3500RS Nano Proflow UHPLC system hyphenated with a high-resolution tandem mass spectrometer (Q Exactive HF, Thermo Scientific). Sample extracts were stored in the autosampler at 8 \u00b0C and 1-\u03bcl loaded at 300 nl/min on a nanoflow UHPLC column (PepMap RSLC, C18, 2 \u03bcm, 100 A\u030a, 50 \u03bcm x 150 mm, Thermo Scientific). Chromatographic separation of metabolites was achieved at 40 \u00b0C and by applying a biphasic gradient consisting of mobile phase A (2% acetonitrile) and phase B (98% acetonitrile), both containing 0.1% formic acid. The RP gradient elution started at 10% B (0-2 min) and a shallow gradient to 95% B over the following 15 min. The high organic (95% B) was kept for 10 min with a 0.5 min return to starting conditions (10% B), followed by 12.5 min of equilibration time, leading to a total runtime of 40 min.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>MS quality assurance:</strong></p><p>To test and guarantee that the LC-MS instrument was cleaned and stable for the metabolomic studies, a series of 4-6 injections of pure solvent (injection blank sample) were run at the beginning of each sequence. To evaluate the quality of the extraction process and guarantee that only biological information from the different samples was obtained, extraction blank samples were injected 3x randomly during each sequence. To stabilize the MS instrument, pooled quality control (QC) samples, prepared individually for each chromatographic separation technique by mixing 5 \u03bcl of each extracted sampled after their reconstitution, were injected 6x at the beginning of each chromatographic sequence after the injections of instrumental blank samples. In addition, QC samples were injected after each 6-8 randomized samples to monitor the stability of the analytical platform, and after each extraction blank injection to preserve the stability of the MS instrument. To avoid instrumental and statistical bias, all biological samples were randomized before injection. To test the technical variability and possible carry over of the instrument during the injection of the different sequences, a quality control standard mixture (LC-MS QC STD Part number 186006963-1, Waters) was injected at the beginning and at the end of each sequence and r.t. and ions evaluated.</p>",

Pre-processing treatment was performed using <strong>Progenesis-QI</strong> (Nonlinear dynamics) software for the resultant data from the HF-UPLC-IM-TOF-HRMS instrument. <strong>Compound discoverer 3.3</strong> (Thermo Scientific) software was used for the resultant data from the nano flow-UHPLC-Orbitrap-HRMS platform, following the \u201cuntargeted metabolomics with statistics and detect unknowns with ID using online databases and mzlogic\u201d workflow. Workflows for both instruments were processed, including on each experiment the biological samples and quality assurance samples (i.e., pooled QC, extraction blanks, and injection blanks). Resultant data matrices containing the different samples and the total list of compounds detected for each experiment were inspected manually by using <strong>Microsoft Excel 2016</strong> to filtrate out the non-biological information (noise, instrumental signals, compounds from the extraction process, etc.). In short, the average value was calculated for each compound in the data matrix for the pooled QC, instrumental blank, and extraction blank samples, as well as the relative standard deviation (RSD) for the QC samples. Compounds with an injection or extraction blank contribution greater than 5% with respect to the average QC sample were removed. Compounds with a QC RSD value greater than 40% were removed. Before any further statistical analysis, data transformation was applied to the different data matrices; K-nearest neighbours based on similar features was employed to replace missing values; and mean sample normalization; log10 data transformation; and pareto data scaling applied to the different sets of data.</p>",
