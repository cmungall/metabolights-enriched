                "description": "<p>Left displaced abomasum (LDA) in postpartum dairy cows contributes to significant economic losses. LDA is characterized by excessive lipolysis and insulin resistance. Although gut dysbiosis is implicated, little is known about the role of the gut microbiota in the abnormal metabolic processes of LDA. To investigate the functional links among microbiota, metabolites, and disease phenotypes in LDA, we performed liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry of fecal samples from cows with LDA (n = 10) and healthy cows (n = 10) matched for parity and days in milk. Plasma marker profiling was synchronously analyzed. Compared with the healthy group, the LDA group showed increased alpha diversity and a shifted microbial community, accompanied by differences in the fecal metabolome and plasma amino acid pools. Based on integrated analysis with the plasma metabolome, eight genera and eight metabolites were associated with LDA. Akkermansia and Oscillospira abundances negatively correlated with 4-pyridoxic acid and tryptophan levels, and positively correlated with non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) and \u03b2-hydroxybutyric acid (BHBA) in amino acid deficit, indicating pyridoxal metabolism-associated gut dysbiosis and lipolysis. The level of salicylic acid derived from microbiota catabolism was decreased in LDA, which negatively correlated with Prevotella, NEFA, and BHBA levels. Conversely, levels of lithocholic acid and taurolithocholic acid were increased in cows with LDA. Changes in branched-chain amino acids implicated novel host\u2013microbial metabolic pathways involving lipolysis and insulin resistance in cows with LDA. Overall, these results suggest interplay between host and gut microbes contributing to LDA pathogenesis.</p>",

Briefly, identification of differential metabolites was carried out by searching an in-house standard MS/MS library and the online database METLIN using MS/MS spectra or exact mass data. The in-house library contains MS/MS spectra of approximately 800 compounds, which were obtained from standards. The MS/MS spectra matching score was calculated using the dot-product algorithm and the score cutoff was set as 0.8. The MS/MS spectra that could not be matched to any of those in the in-house library were searched in online databases. Mass error was set within 25 ppm.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Yong K, Luo ZZ, Luo Q, Yang QW, Huang YX, Zhao XX, Zhang Y, Cao SZ.
