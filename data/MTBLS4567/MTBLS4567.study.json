                "description": "<p><em>Pinus radiata</em> seedlings, the most widely planted pine species in the world, were exposed to temperatures within a range mimicking future scenarios based on current models of heat increase. The short-term heat response in <em>P. radiata</em> was studied in detail by exploring the metabolome, proteome and targeted transcriptome. The use of complementary mass spectrometry techniques, GC-MS and LC-Orbitrap-MS, together with novel bioinformatics tools allowed the reliable quantification of 2075 metabolites and 901 protein groups. Integrative analyses of different functional levels and plant physiological status revealed a complex molecular interaction network of positive and negative correlations between proteins and metabolites involved in short-term heat response, including three main physiological functions as: 1) A hormone subnetwork, where fatty acids, flavonoids and hormones presented a key role; 2) An oxidoreductase subnetwork, including several dehydrogenase and peroxidase proteins; and 3) A heat shock protein subnetwork, with numerous proteins that contain a HSP20 domain, all of which were overexpressed at the transcriptional level. Integrated analysis pinpointed the basic mechanisms underlying the short-term physiological reaction of <em>P. radiata</em> during heat response. This approach was feasible in forest species and unmasked two novel candidate biomarkers of heat resistance, PHO1 and TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR APFI, and a MITOCHONDRIAL SMALL HEAT SHOCK PROTEIN, for use in future breeding programs.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Data availability:</strong></p><p>The proteomics data have been deposited into the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository with the data set identifier <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD032754' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>PXD032754</a>.</p>",

Prior assays, plants were acclimatized for over a 1-mth period time inside the controlled chamber, watered at field capacity every day and fertilized weekly with nutritive solution (N:P:K 5:8:10).</p><p>For the first experiment<strong>, P. radiata seedlings</strong> were subjected to 40 \u00b0C heat stress assay as previously described<strong>[1]</strong>. Briefly, heat stress was applied during the central h of the day, employing a temperature ramp from 15 to 40 \u00b0C over 5 h. High temperature was hold for 6 h and then ramped down again to night values. The stress was applied for 3 consecutive days, and plants were sampled at the end of the 40 \u00b0C period on <strong>first (T1)</strong> and <strong>last day (T3</strong>) (<strong>Figure 1</strong> in the paper associated with this study).</p><p>On the other hand, in the second experiment <strong>P. radiata</strong> seedlings were subjected to 45 \u00b0C heat stress memory assay as described previously<strong>[2]</strong>. Summing up, to test long-lasting memory acquisition related to an acclimation process, assay was divided in 2 similar phases 6 mth apart from each other. In each phase, treatment was applied during the central h of the day, employing a temperature ramp from 15 to 45 \u00b0C over 5 h. High temperature was hold for 6 h and then ramped down again to night values. This procedure was repeated for 5 consecutive days, and plants were sampled at the end of the 45 \u00b0C period on day 1 (T1), day 3 (T3) and day 5 (T5). Thus, Phase I was stablished as the first 45 \u00b0C treatment and Phase II as the second treatment after 6 months (<strong>Figure 1</strong> in the paper associated with this study).</p><p><strong>Control samples (C) </strong>were collected the first day of each experiment at the same time before starting the heat exposure treatment. The 3 biological replicates of each treatment were pools of 3 plant each. The individuals conforming each pool were kept during the experiments. All samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 \u00b0C until RNA was extracted.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Needles</strong> within the range of 6-7 cm long from P. radiata seedlings were sampled (9 seedlings per sampling-point), cleaned with a moistened cloth and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen until metabolites were extracted.

For the high-performance liquid chromatography component, a Dionex Ultimate 3000 (ThermoFisher Scientific, USA) was used. Recordings from both the DAD. Detector and the high-resolution mass spectrometer were monitored and saved to check system functioning and evaluate later results.&nbsp;The resolution and sensitivity of the Orbitrap were controlled by the injection of a mixed standard after the analysis of each batch (30 samples), and the resolution was also checked with the aid of lock masses (phthalates). Blanks were also analyzed during the sequence<strong>[1]</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p>GC-MS measurements were carried out on a triple quad instrument (TSQ Quantum GC; Thermo, USA). The mass spectrometer was operated in electron-impact (EI) mode at 70 eV in a scan range of 40-600 m/z. The temperatures of the transfer line of GC-MS and the source of the mass spectrometer were 340 and 250 \u00b0C, respectively.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Meij\u00f3n M, Feito I, Oravec M, Delatorre C, Weckwerth W, Majada J, Valledor L.
