                "description": "<p>Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a systemic autoimmune disease with a remarkable predominance in female, suggesting that steroid hormones may be involved in the pathogenesis. Herein, more than 70 kinds of steroids in urine were detected by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) to reveal SLE-specific steroid alterations. Principle component analysis demonstrated that the steroid profile was obviously distinguished between SLE patients and controls. Lower level of total androgens was observed in patients, and 9 androgens (DHEA, testosterone, Etio, androsterone, \u03b2\u03b1\u03b2-Diol, Epi-An, Epi-DHT, 16\u03b1-OH-DHEA, A-Diol) underwent significant decrease. Besides, SLE patients exhibited slightly higher level of total estrogens than controls, and 3 estrogens (17-Epi-E3, 17\u03b1-E2, E3) were remarkably increased. Furthermore, we identified the elevation of 2 sterols (Lan, Chol), and the reduction of 1 corticoid (11-DeoxyF) and 2 progestins (5\u03b1-DHP, 11\u03b2-OH-Prog) in patients. In this study, metabolic signature of urinary steroids associated with SLE was comprehensively defined by GC/MS for the first time, and steroid metabolism disorders were found in SLE patients, especially the conversion of androgens to estrogens. Our findings will provide new insights for a deeper understanding of the mechanism of steroid hormones in the pathogenesis of SLE, and help to unravel the reason of sexual disparity in SLE.</p>",

All participants were females, from 26 to 55 years old, not pregnant at the time. They all completed a screening evaluation which included a detailed medical history. These SLE patients were diagnosed according to the 1997 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Classification criteria and are under anti-SLE treatment, while the healthy volunteers were absent of any clinical manifestations of SLE or any inflammatory or autoimmune diseases. This study was approved by the ethics committee of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University (No. AF- BG-006-1.0), and every subject has given informed consent. The analysis of urinary steroid profile was based on the protocol of Moon<strong>[1]</strong>. Briefly, 10 mL urine was collected from subjects between 6:00-8:00 in the morning, after fasting for 12 h. The samples centrifuged at 1300 rpm at 4 \u00b0C for 5 min and they stored at -80 \u00b0C. A total of 2 mL of urine was added into a microcentrifuge tube containing 20 \u03bcL of internal standard solution (10 \u03bcg/mL of d3-testosterone, 35 \u03bcg/mL of d4-cortisol, 35 \u03bcg/mL of d9-progesterone, 35 \u03bcg/mL of d7-cholesterol, 10 \u03bcg/mL of 13c3-androstene-3,17-dione and 10 \u03bcg/mL of 13c3-estrone).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Moon JY, Jung HJ, Moon MH, Chung BC, Choi MH.

In total 1 mL acetate buffer (0.2 M, pH 5.2), 100 \u03bcL 0.2% L-ascorbic acid and 50 \u03bcL glucosaldehydase/arylsulfatase was added, and then incubate at 55 \u00b0C for 3 h.

The upper layer were merged and concentrated to dry under nitrogen at 40 \u00b0C, and further dried in a vacuum dryer for 60 min. Before GC/MS analysis, 40 \u03bcL of MSTFA/NH4I/DTE mixture (500:4:2, v/w/w) was added for derivation, and reaction for 20 min at 60 \u00b0C in water bath.

Steroid hormones were separated using a 25 m x 0.2 mm x 0.33 \u03bcm Ultra-1 column (J&amp;W Scientific, Folsom, CA, USA; 19091A-102). The sample injection volume was 2 \u03bcL with a split ratio of 5:1. Helium (99.9996%) was used as the carrier gas and the flow rate was 1.0 mL/min. The oven temperature program was: the initial temperature was 215 \u00b0C, ramped to 260 \u00b0C at 1 \u00b0C/min, and then ramped to 320 \u00b0C at 15 \u00b0C/min, and held for 5 min. The injector and transfer line temperatures were both 280 \u00b0C. Full scan mode and selective ion scan was used for qualitative and quantitative analysis of urinary steroid hormones, respectively. During the analysis process, different groups of samples were interspersed and 1 QC samples were added into the analysis sequence for every 5 samples.</p>",

After normalized to the internal standard of corresponding hormone varieties, the data were subjected to a principal component analysis (PCA) using the SIMCA-P 11.0 version (Umetrics AB, Umea, Sweden) to display an overview of the difference of hormone profiles between groups. Further, orthogonal signal correction (OSC) partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) was performed to distinguish SLE patients and controls. Analysis of variance testing of the cross-validated residuals (CV-ANOVA) was used to measure the reliability of the OSC PLS-DA model. The variable importance of projection (VIP) reflects the importance of variables in interpreting the model, and those with VIP &gt; 1.0 were selected as potential discriminant steroids. SPSS 18.0 (International Business Machines Corp., Armonk, USA) was employed to conduct T-test for each steroid hormone. OSC PLS-DA (VIP&gt;1) and T-test (P&lt;0.05) were combined to find out the differential steroid hormones between two groups. Based on the screened steroids, the metabolic pathway was drawn by using Metscape 3.1.3. Further, Pearson analysis was carried out to measure the correlation between the discriminant steroids.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Moon JY, Ha YW, Moon MH, Chung BC, Choi MH.
