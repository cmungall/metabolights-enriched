                "description": "<p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> Perioperative neurocognitive disorder (PND) is a key complication affecting older individuals after anesthesia and surgery. Failure to translate multiple pharmacological therapies for PND from preclinical studies to clinical settings has necessitated the exploration of novel therapeutic strategies. Human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSCs) treatment has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for treating neurodegenerative diseases and has the potential to translate basic science into clinical practice. In this study, we investigated the effects and underlying mechanism of hUC-MSCs on PND in aged mice.</p><p><strong>METHODS:</strong> hUC-MSCs were isolated from an infant umbilical cord and identified using flow cytometry and differentiation assays. We established PND model by undergoing aseptic laparotomy under isoflurane anesthesia maintaining spontaneous ventilation in 18-month-old male C57BL/6 mice. hUC-MSCs were slowly injected into mice by coccygeal vein before anesthesia. Cognitive function, neuroinflammation, neuroplasticity, endogenous neurogenesis and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were assessed. To determine the mechanisms underlying by which hUC-MSCs mediate their neuroprotective effects in PND, K252a, an antagonist of BDNF receptor, was administered intraperitoneally before surgery. Hippocampal BDNF/TrkB/CREB signaling pathway and metabolomic signatures were evaluated.</p><p><strong>RESULTS:</strong> hUC-MSC treatment ameliorated the learning and memory impairment in aged mice with PND. The downstream effects were the suppression of neuroinflammatory responses and restoration of neurogenesis and neuroplasticity dysregulation. Interestingly, the level of mature BDNF, but not that of proBDNF, was increased in the hippocampus after hUC-MSC treatment. Further analysis revealed that the improved cognitive recovery and the restoration of neurogenesis and neuroplasticity dysregulation elicited by exposure to hUC-MSCs were, at least partially, mediated by the activation of the BDNF/TrkB/CREB signaling pathway. Untargeted metabolomic further identified lipid metabolism dysfunction as potential downstream of the BDNF/TrkB/CREB signaling pathway in hUC-MSC-mediated neuroprotection for PND.</p><p><strong>CONCLUSIONS:</strong> Our study highlights the beneficial effects of hUC-MSC treatment on PND and provides a justification to consider the potential use of hUC-MSCs in the perioperative period.</p>",

                        "description": "<p><strong>Animals and housing conditions</strong></p><p>Briefly, 18-month-old male C57BL/6 mice weighing 28-32 g were obtained from the Jinan Pengyue Animal Company. All animals were housed (5 mice per cage) in an air-conditioned room kept at 21 \u00b1 2 \u00b0C with a relative humidity of 45 \u00b1 5% and 12 h light/dark cycle. They were fed standard rodent food and water ad libitum and acclimated to the environment for a week before commencing the experimental procedures. This study was carried out in compliance with the ARRIVE guidelines. All efforts were made to minimize the number and suffering of the animals used in the study. A total of 200 aged mice were used. The number of mice that contributed data for analysis in each experiment was indicated in figure legends in the paper associated with this study. The experimental protocol was approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Qilu Hospital (Qingdao), Shandong University (approval no: KYDWLL-202221) and was conducted in accordance with the guidelines for experimental animal use established by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Shandong University.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>hUC-MSC preparation</strong></p><p>An umbilical cord for MSC isolation and culture was obtained at Qilu hospital from a full-term healthy infant delivered after a caesarean section, whose mother had signed an informed consent form and the procedure was approved by the Qilu hospital\u2019s human research ethics committee (approval no: KYLL-2021(KS)-086). The isolation and culture of the hUC-MSCs were conducted according to protocols published by our group and previously described procedures<strong>[1][2]</strong>. The isolated hUC-MSCs were cultured at 37 \u00b0C with a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. The medium was changed every 3-4 days. After reaching 90% confluence, the cells were trypsinized using 0.25% trypsin and passaged at 1 x 10^4 cells/cm^2 to passage 5 used in the study.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>hUC-MSC characterization</strong></p><p>The characteristics of hUC-MSCs were evaluated using flow cytometry. Passage 5 hUC-MSCs were trypsinized and centrifuged. Next, 1 x 10^6 cells were resuspended in 100 \u03bcL of cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) per sample and then stained with APC anti-human CD166 antibody (Biolegend, 343906), APC anti-human CD29 antibody (Biolegend, 303008), FITC anti-human CD90 (Thy1) antibody (Biolegend, 328108), FITC anti-human HLA-DR antibody (Biolegend,327006), FITC anti-human CD73 (Ecto-5\u2019-nucleotidase) antibody (Biolegend, 344016), FITC anti-human CD105 antibody (Biolegend, 323204), FITC anti-human CD45 antibody (Biolegend, 304006), respectively. After 15 min, the cells were washed and resuspended in 100 \u03bcL PBS. The cells were analyzed using a flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, FACSCelesta). In total, 50,000 events were collected per sample. The data were analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star Inc., Ashland, OR, USA).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>hUC-MSC differentiation</strong></p><p>The hUC-MSC differentiation potentials to adipocytes, osteocytes and chondrocytes were confirmed in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. For these assays, the cells were cultured and induced with adipogenic differentiation medium (Oricell, HUXUC-90031), osteogenic differentiation medium (Oricell, HUXUC-90031) and chondrogenic differentiation medium (Oricell, HUXUC-90031), and stained with Oil Red O, Alizarin Red and Alcian Blue.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>PND animal model and drug administration/hUC-MSC transplantation</strong></p><p>A modified aseptic exploratory laparotomy was performed under isoflurane anesthesia as described in our previous studies<strong>[3][4]</strong>. Mice were induced to lose the righting reflex with 3.5% isoflurane and 100% oxygen in a chamber while maintaining spontaneous ventilation. The mice were then placed in the right lateral position and maintained with 1.5% isoflurane for 20 min. The surgical procedure was performed under 1.5-2% isoflurane and 100% oxygen using a mouse anesthesia mask. A rectal temperature of 37 \u00b0C was maintained by using a heated blanket during the procedure. Abdominal entry was performed using a 1 cm midline vertical incision after shaving and cleaning the skin with an iodophor disinfectant. The operator vigorously manipulated the viscera and musculature by inserting a sterile probe into the peritoneal cavity and stretching the musculature without damaging the intraperitoneal organs. Subsequently, a 2-cm intestine was exteriorized and vigorously rubbed using 2 sterile swabs for 30 s and then placed back into the peritoneal cavity. The peritoneal lining and skin were closed and sutured using 4-0 sterile surgical sutures. The wound was covered with polysporin (Johnson &amp; Johnson Inc.) to relieve and prevent postoperative pain and infection. The procedure lasted approximately 15 min, and the total duration of anesthesia was 1.5 h. Surgery did not impair limb function, ensuring normal activities in behavioral tests.</p><p><br></p><p>On the day of establishment of the animal model, cultured hUC-MSCs were harvested and suspended in normal saline (0.9% NaCl). A total dose of 2.8 x 10^7 cells/kg in 100 \u03bcL normal saline per mouse was slowly injected into mice by coccygeal vein using a 31G needle 1 h before anesthesia. The number of hUC-MSCs tolerated by the mice in this study was determined to be the highest number that did not cause side effects. The same volume of normal saline was injected into mice in the other groups. In second experiment, K252a (an antagonist of the TrkB receptor, MCE, 99533-80-9) diluted in 0.1% methyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was intraperitoneally administered at 25 \u03bcg/kg per injection daily for 15 days before hUC-MSC transplantation. Based on previous reports, a low concentration of K252a was selected to avoid any unwanted effects<strong>[5]-[7]</strong>. The same amount of DMSO and normal saline were administered intraperitoneally to mice in other groups. Mice were randomly allocated into groups based on computer-generated randomization tables in each experiment.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Untargeted metabolomic experiments\ufeff</strong></p><p>The hippocampal tissue was harvested and weighed from MSC plus surgery group and MSC plus K252a plus surgery group at 15 days after surgery. Dried lyophilized were ground in a 2 mL Eppendorf tube, which contains a 5 mm tungsten bead for 1 min at 65 Hz in a Grinding Mill.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Can A, Balci D.
