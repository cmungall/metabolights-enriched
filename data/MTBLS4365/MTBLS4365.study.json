                "description": "<p>Late blight is one of the main biological stresses limiting the potato yield; however, the biochemical mechanisms underlying the infection process of <em>Phytophthora infestans</em> remain unrevealed. In this study, the late blight-resistant potato cultivar Ziyun No.1 (R) and the susceptible cultivar Favorita (S) were inoculated with <em>P. infestans</em>. Untargeted metabolomics was used to study the changes of metabolites in the compatible and incompatible interactions of the two cultivars and the pathogen at 0, 48 and 96 h postinoculation (hpi). A total of 819 metabolites were identified, and the metabolic differences mainly emerged after 48 hpi. There were 198 and 115 differentially expressed metabolites (DEMs) in the compatible and incompatible interactions. These included 147 and 100 upregulated metabolites during the compatible and incompatible interactions, respectively. Among them, 73 metabolites were identified as the <em>P. infestans</em>-responsive DEMs. Furthermore, the comparisons between the two cultivars identified 57 resistance-related metabolites. Resistant potato cultivar had higher levels of salicylic acid and several upstream phenylpropanoid biosynthesis metabolites, triterpenoids and hydroxycinnamic acids and their derivatives, such as sakuranetin, ferulic acid, ganoderic acid Mi, lucidenic acid D2 and caffeoylmalic acid. These metabolites play crucial roles in cell wall thickening and have antibacterial and antifungal activities. This study reports the time-course metabolomic responses of potatoes to <em>P. infestans</em>. The findings reveal the responses involved in the compatible and incompatible interactions of potatoes and <em>P. infestans</em>.</p>",

Growth conditions included a light intensity of 2000 lux, day/night temperature of 25/22 \u00b0C, and relative humidity of 70%. Thereafter, the seedlings were transplanted into plastic pots (with a diameter of 7 cm and a height of 7.5 cm) containing TS1 fine matrix (Klasmann-Deilmann, Germany) and placed in a light incubator under the similar growth conditions described above.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Pathogen Infection and Sample Collection</strong></p><p>The <em>P. infestans</em> (SCPZ16-3-1) used in this study was isolated from infected potato leaves without any genetic modification and stored them on the Rye agar medium until use. A 1 cm^2 fungus block was cut from the Rye agar medium and transferred under a sterilized potato chip and then cultured at 18 \u00b0C in dark for 5 days. Later, the mycelia were collected into 5 mL of sterile water, homogenized and filtered using a single-layer gauze to sporangia suspension. The suspension was then incubated at 7 \u00b0C for 2-4 h to stimulate the release of zoospores whose concentration was adjusted to 5 x 10^4 zoospores per mL. After the virus-free seedlings grew to about 10 cm high, 60 plantlets with healthy growth vigor were selected and sprayed with zoospore suspension (50 mL). The plantlets were then placed in sealed boxes with moist tissue to maintain humidity and incubated in the dark for 12 h to reduce ultraviolet (UV) degradation of the inoculum. Subsequently, they were moved to a 16/8 h day/night photoperiod chamber with a light intensity of 2000 lux, day/night temperature of 25/22 \u00b0C, and relative humidity of 100%. All equipment, materials and facilities used in this study (including the cubicle greenhouse, pots and steam-sterilized nutrient soil) were sterilized by UV irradiation or autoclaving before and after the experiment.</p><p><br></p><p>Leaf samples were collected at 0 h before inoculation (0 hbi) and at 48 and 96 h postinoculation (hpi) from both the cultivars, Ziyun No.1 (R) and Favorita (S), corresponding to 6 sample groups (R1, R2 and R3 for Ziyun No.1, and S1, S2 and S3 for Favorita). Each sample group consisted of 6 biological replicates, and each replicate contained at least 10 leaves from 3 plants. The leaf samples were immediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and then submitted to Shanghai Majorbio Biopharm Technology Co., Ltd, for the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) non-targeted metabolomic analysis.</p>",

The data matrix of the preprocessed results consisted of the retention time (RT), mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) values and peak intensity. At least 80% of the metabolic features detected in any set of samples were retained. After filtering, the minimum metabolite values were imputed for specific samples with the metabolite levels below the lower quantitation limit, and each metabolic feature was normalized by summation. The internal standard was used for data QC (reproducibility), and the metabolic features with the relative standard deviation (RSD) of QC &gt; 30% were discarded. Following normalization and imputation processes, statistical analysis was performed on the log-transformed data to identify the significant differences in the metabolite levels between the comparable groups.</p><p><br></p><p>A multivariate statistical analysis was performed on the free online platform of <strong>Majorbio Cloud Platform</strong> (<a href='https://cloud.majorbio.com' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>https://cloud.majorbio.com</a>). Partial Least Squares - Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) was used to determine the global metabolic changes between the comparable groups after the metabolite variables were subjected to Pareto Scaling, with a confidence level of 0.95. Variable importance in projection (VIP) was also calculated using the OPLS-DA model. Furthermore, p values were estimated using the one-way paired t-test. A total of 5945 and 5644 peaks were selected for the electrospray ionized (ESI+) and non-electrospray ionized (ESI-) metabolites, respectively. Metabolites with the threshold of |log2FC| &gt;1, p &lt; 0.05, VIP value\uff1e1 were considered differential and mapped to the <strong>KEGG</strong> pathway database through metabolic enrichment pathway analysis (<strong>KEGG</strong>) (<a href='http://www. genome.jp/kegg/' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>http://www. genome.jp/kegg/</a>). These metabolites were then classified according to <strong>KEGG</strong> annotation.</p>",
