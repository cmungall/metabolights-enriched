                "description": "Staphylococcus aureus is a human pathogen that can cause a wide range of diseases. Although formerly regarded as extracellular pathogen, it has been shown that S. aureus can also be internalized by host cells and persist within these cells. In the present study, we comparatively analyzed survival and physiological adaptation of S. aureus HG001 after internalization by two human lung epithelial cell lines (S9 and A549), and human embryonic kidney cells (HEK 293). Combining enrichment of bacteria from host-pathogen assays by cell sorting and quantitation of the pathogen's proteome by mass spectrometry we characterized S. aureus adaptation during the initial phase between 2.5 h and 6.5 h post-infection. Starting with about 2 \u00d7 10^6 bacteria, roughly 1450 S. aureus proteins, including virulence factors and metabolic enzymes were identified by spectral comparison and classical database searches. Most of the bacterial adaptation reactions, such as decreased levels of ribosomal proteins and metabolic enzymes or increased amounts of proteins involved in arginine and lysine biosynthesis, enzymes coding for terminal oxidases and stress responsive proteins or activation of the sigma factor SigB were observed after internalization into any of the three cell lines studied. However, differences were noted in central carbon metabolism including regulation of fermentation and threonine degradation. Since these differences coincided with different intracellular growth behavior, complementary profiling of the metabolome of the different non-infected host cell types was performed. This revealed similar levels of intracellular glucose but host cell specific differences in the amounts of amino acids such as glycine, threonine or glutamate. With this comparative study we provide an impression of the common and specific features of the adaptation of S. aureus HG001 to specific host cell environments as a starting point for follow-up studies with different strain isolates and regulatory mutants. Metabolome analysis, by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, was performed for the infection medium (extracellular medium, mock infection of 1 h).",

Bacteria were cultivated in prokaryotic minimal essential medium (pMEM) until the exponential growth phase (OD600 0.4) as described previously [3]. The number of bacterial cells present in the culture at OD600 was determined by flow cytometry with a Guava easyCyte\u2122 flow cytometer (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) using GFP constitutively expressed from pMV158GFP.\n</p>\nCell lines and cultivation conditions:</br>\nS9 cells [adeno 12 SV40 hybrid virus-transformed human bronchial epithelial cells, ATCC\u00ae number CRL-2778 and A549 cells [human lung cancer-derived alveolar epithelial cells, ATCC\u00ae number CCL-185, were cultivated in eukaryotic minimal essential medium (eMEM) as described previously (Pf\u00f6rtner et al., 2013). HEK 293 cells [adenovirus type 5-transformed human embryonic kidney cells were cultivated in modified eMEM for HEK 293 cells (HEK-eMEM; 1\u00d7MEM [Biochrom AG), supplemented with additional 10% (v/v) dialyzed fetal bovine serum (FBS, Invitrogen), 2% (v/v) L-glutamine (PAA), 1% (v/v) sodium pyruvate (PAA), and 1% (v/v) non-essential amino acids (PAA)]. Cells were cultured in 10-cm-diameter tissue culture plates at 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO2 in a humid atmosphere. Prior to infection experiments, host cells were seeded in 24-well tissue culture plates 3 days in advance and cultivated until confluence.\n</p>\nInternalization settings:</br>\nS. aureus HG001 pMV158GFP was cultivated in pMEM until OD600 0.4. Based on a calibration curve, an infection mix of bacterial culture was prepared in host cell medium buffered with 2.2 g/l sodium hydrogen carbonate. Bacterial cultures were diluted in this mix to infect host cells with a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 25. Afterwards, the cell culture medium of confluent host cells was replaced by this infection mix, and bacteria could sediment, attach to and be internalized by host cells in an incubator at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2 for 1 h. Subsequently, one ml of host cell supernatant containing non-internalized bacteria was collected to represent the non-adherent control. The remaining infection mix was replaced by host cell medium containing 10 \u03bcg/ml lysostaphin (AMBI PRODUCTS LLC, Lawrence, NY, USA). Non-internalized S. aureus cells were killed efficiently in this step within 30 min [4]. After 2.5 h and 6.5 h supernatant was removed and cell layers were washed twice with PBS. Host cells were lysed with 0.1% Triton X-100 in water for 5 min at 37 \u00b0C and rinsed afterwards with PBS. Bacterial cell counts were again determined with a Guava easyCyte\u2122 flow cytometer (Millipore).\n</p>\nRef: </br>\n[1] Herbert S., Ziebandt A.
