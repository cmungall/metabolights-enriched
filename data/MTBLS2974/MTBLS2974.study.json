                "description": "Overactive immune response is a critical factor triggering host death upon bacterial infection. However, the mechanism behind the regulation of excessive immune responses is still largely unknown, and the corresponding control and preventive measures are also to be explored. In this study, we find that the Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus, died from Edwardsiella tarda infection had higher level of immune responses than those survived. Such immune responses are strongly associated with the metabolism that was altered at 6 h post-infection. By GC-MS-based metabolome profiling, we identify glycine, serine and threonine metabolism as the top three of the most impacted pathways, which were not properly activated in the fish died out of infection. Serine is one of the crucial biomarkers. Exogenous serine can promote O. niloticus survival both as prophylactic and therapeutic upon E. tarda infection. Our further analysis revealed that exogenous serine flux into the glycine, serine and threonine metabolism, and more importantly, to the glutathione metabolism via glycine. The increased glutathione synthesis could downregulate reactive oxygen species. Therefore, these data together suggest that metabolic modulation of immune responses could be a potential preventive strategy to control overactive immune responses.",

Animals were maintained according to standard protocols. All experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Sun Yat-sen University (approval no. SYSU-IACUC-2020-B126716).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Fish and rearing conditions</strong></p><p><strong>Nile tilapia</strong> (<strong><em>Oreochromis niloticus</em></strong>), hatched from the same batch of fertilized eggs and collected at 65 \u00b1 5 days postfertilization with a weight of 100 \u00b1 2 g, were obtained from Guangdong Tilapia Breeding Farm (Guangzhou, China) with equal numbers of <strong>males </strong>and <strong>females</strong>. <strong><em>O. niloticus</em></strong> was maintained in 25-Liter tanks equipped with closed recirculating aquaculture systems, and the maintenance physicochemical parameters were the following: water temperature, 28 \u00b0C; dissolved oxygen, 6 to 7 mg/Liter; carbon dioxide content, ,10 mg/Liter; pH value, 7.0 to 7.5; nitrogen content, 1 to 2 mg/Liter; and nitrite content, 0.1 to 0.3 mg/Liter. These animals were acclimated under this condition for 2 wks before the experiment and were fed twice daily with commercial fish feed on a 12-h/12-h rhythm of light and dark photoperiods. The tank was cleaned twice a day by siphoning up the food debris and feces.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Bacterial strains and infection dose</strong></p><p><strong><em>E. tarda</em></strong> EIB202 (CCTCC no. M208068) was a generous gift from X. H. Zhang, Ocean University of China. A single colony of <strong>E. tarda </strong>EIB202 was picked up from a tryptic soy broth (TSB) plate and propagated overnight in 100 ml TSB medium at 200 rpm at 30 \u00b0C. The culture was diluted 1:100 into fresh TSB medium until the optical density at 600 nm was 1.0. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation at 6,000 x g for 5 min. The cells were washed 3 times with saline solution and finally resuspended in saline solution for infection. To determine the lethal dose, <strong><em>O. niloticus </em></strong>fish were intraperitoneally infected with 3 different <strong>doses </strong>of bacteria, including <strong>0.8 x 10^8</strong> , <strong>1.6 x 10^8</strong> , and <strong>3.2 x 10^8</strong> CFU/fish. There were 20 <em>O. niloticus</em> fish at each <strong>dose</strong>. The <strong>mortality </strong>was monitored twice a day for a total of 14 days.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Isolation of monocytes/macrophages from head kidney and sample preparation for GC-MS</strong></p><p>To identify metabolic signature associated with <strong><em>O. niloticus</em></strong> upon <strong><em>E. tarda </em></strong>infection, <strong>monocytes/macrophages </strong>isolated from <strong><em>O. niloticus</em></strong> challenged with the LD50 of <strong><em>E. tarda</em></strong> were analyzed. 40 <strong><em>O. niloticus </em></strong>fish were randomly divided into two groups with 20 animals in each group. As shown in<strong> Fig. S1A</strong> in the paper associated with this study, animals in 1 group were sacrificed at <strong>6 h postinfection</strong>, and animals in the other group were considered <strong>surviving fish 5 days postinfection</strong>, after which no more fish would die. Isolation of monocytes/macrophages was performed as previously described<strong>[2]</strong>. Briefly, <strong>head kidneys</strong> were aseptically removed and pressed through an 80-mm sterile steel mesh to exclude unhomogenized tissues. The filtrates were then resuspended in L-15 medium (Gibco, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco, USA) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Sigma, USA). The cell suspensions were layered onto a 54%/31% discontinuous Percoll (Sigma, USA) density gradient and centrifuged at 400 x g at 4\u00b0C for 40 min. The cells were washed 3 times with serum-free medium at 400 x g and used immediately for GS-MS preparation.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Retention index</strong></p><p>Retention index (RI) was performed with alkane standards (alkane mix 34, CDAA-M-690038-HD-1ml; ANPEL Laboratory Technologies [Shanghai] Inc., Shanghai, China), which includes n-octane (CAS: 111-65- 9), n-decane (CAS: 124-18-5), n-dodecane (CAS: 112-40-3), n-tetradecane (CAS: 629-59-4), n-hexadecane (CAS: 544-76-3), n-octadecane (CAS: 593-45-3), n-eicosane (CAS: 112-95-8), n-docosane (CAS: 629-97-0), n-tetracosane (CAS: 646-31-1), n-hexacosane (CAS: 630-01-3), n-octacosane (CAS: 630-02-4), n-triacontane (CAS: 638-68-6), n-dotriacontane (CAS: 544-85-4, n-tetratriacontane (CAS: 14167-59-0), n-hexatriacontane (CAS: 630-06-8), n-octatriacontane (CAS: 7194-85-6, n-tetracontane (CAS: 4181-95-7), n-heptane (CAS: 142-82-5), n-nonane (CAS: 111-84-2), n-undecane (CAS: 1120-21-4), n-tridecane (CAS: 629-50- 5), n-pentadecane (CAS: 629-62-9), n-heptadecane (CAS: 629-78-7), n-nonadecane (CAS: 629-92-5), n-heneicosane (CAS: 629-94-7), n-tricosane (CAS: 638-67-5), n-pentacosane (cas: 629-99-2), n-heptacosane (CAS: 593-49-7), n-nonacosane (CAS: 630-03-5), n-hentriacontane (CAS: 630-04-6), n-tritriacontane (CAS: 630-05-7), n-pentatriacontane (CAS: 630-07-9), n-heptatriacontane (CAS: 7194-84-5), n-nonatriacontane (CAS: 7194-86-7).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong>&nbsp;National Research Council. 2011.

                        "description": "<p>Date processing was performed as previously described<strong>[1]</strong>. GC-MS chromatograms were analyzed using <strong>ChemiStation</strong> (<strong>ChemiStation C.01.01</strong>), and each peak was integrated individually. The deconvolution and calibration of <strong>raw </strong>data mass spectra were performed with <strong>AMDIS</strong> (Agilent OpenLAB CDS). </p><p><br></p><p>Metabolites were identified by retrieving their mass spectra in the <strong>NIST 2011</strong> library (National Institute of Standards and Technology, USA) and <strong>GMD 2011</strong> (Golm Metabolome Database, Germany) according to the following criteria: match value of $750, reverse match value of $800, and a probability of $60%<strong>[2]</strong>. Peaks with a signal-to-noise ratio greater than 30 were reserved to avoid false positives<strong>[3]</strong>. The <strong>raw </strong>data of mixed alkanes are automatically imported into <strong>AMDIS</strong>, and the retention index of each substance is generated by <strong>AMDIS</strong>. The combined normalization processing consisted of the following options<strong>[4]</strong>: quantile normalization row-wise procedures and center scaling (the variable is centered but not scaled [ws = 1]). The 0's or missing values were assessed by the singular value decomposition (SVD) method to impute the missing values<strong>[5]</strong>. The data matrix was used for the subsequent multivariate statistical analysis. For the spectra that were not identified as described above, ion fragments were manually extracted from the extracted ion chromatography (EIC) and searched against <strong>GOLM </strong>(<a href='http://gmd.mpimp-golm.mpg .de/' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>http://gmd.mpimp-golm.mpg .de/</a>) and <strong>MassBank </strong>(<a href='https://massbank.eu/MassBank/Search' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>https://massbank.eu/MassBank/Search</a>)<strong>[7]</strong> for metabolite retrieval and identification, and RI was used to confirm identity. <strong>Metabolomic standards initiative</strong> (<strong>MSI</strong>) level of the reported metabolites was determined as described previously<strong>[8]</strong>. In level 1, identified metabolites are confirmed with authentic compound standards with at least two ortholog parameters; in level 2, identified metabolites are similar to the spectrum in public or commercial databases; in level 3, metabolites were identified to a class or similar known compounds. Level 4 is unidentified metabolites. Two methodologies were adopted to minimize batch variation. First, the internal standard ribitol was used to monitor the quality control from batch to batch. Second, the instrument was calibrated with GC-MS tuning standard PFTBA (05971-60571l; Agilent Technologies, USA) after instrument maintenance. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Statistical analysis, multivariate data analysis, and pathway enrichment analysis</strong></p><p>Statistical analysis was performed with <strong>SPSS 13.0</strong>. The difference among metabolites was determined with Mann-Whitney U test and Kruskal-Wallis test as described previously, where a P value of ,0.05 was considered statistically significant<strong>[9]</strong>. Z-score was used to analyze normalized area of differential metabolites. Z-score analysis scaled each metabolite according to a reference distribution<strong>[10]</strong>. The mean and standard deviation from each metabolite were determined in these samples. <strong><em>O. niloticus</em></strong> was incubated with <strong><em>E. tarda</em></strong> EIB202. The first day of survival (<strong>1S</strong>) and the first day of dying (<strong>1D</strong>) were centered by the 5 days of survival (<strong>5S</strong>) mean and scaled by the preinfection standard deviation. PLS-DA and orthologous PLS-DA (OPLS-DA) were performed by <strong>SIMCA 14.0</strong> (Umetrics, Ume\u00e5, Sweden) to identify patterns associated with infection and minimize influence of the interindividual variation. To exclude the possible overfit of the model, a 10-fold cross-validation and permutation test (999 times) were adopted. The overfit was monitored by the intercept on the y axis, wherein a value of Q2 Y of less than 0.05 indicates a good model<strong>[11]</strong>. In addition, the pattern recognition model was assessed based on the values of R2 and Q2 , both of which together indicate the quality of the model. Therefore, the model is robust when R2 . 0.5 and Q2 . 0.4<strong>[12]</strong>. Data were log transformed prior to data import. Center scaling was selected before fitting. All variables were mean centered and scaled to standard deviation of each metabolite. Enrichment of significant pathways was conducted with<strong> MetaboAnalyst 5.0[13]</strong>. The input data were limited to metabolites with significant differential. The 2log(p) value and a value reflecting the impact of each metabolic pathway were calculated using a hypergeometric test, and the metabolic pathways with a P value of ,0.05 were considered significant. Comparative metabolic pathway analysis between the 2 groups was performed with <strong>iPath 3.0 </strong>(<a href='https://pathways.embl.de/' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>https://pathways.embl.de/</a>).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1] </strong>Liu SR, Peng XX, Li H.
