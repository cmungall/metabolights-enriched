                "description": "<p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> Traditional Chinese medicine has used <em>Peucedanum praeruptorum</em> Dunn (Apiaceae) for a long time. Various coumarins, including the significant root constituents Praeruptorin (A-E), are the active constituents of the dried roots of P. praeruptorum. Previous transcriptomic and metabolomic studies attempted to elucidate the distribution and biosynthetic network of these medicinal-valuable compounds. However, the lack of a high-quality reference genome impedes an in-depth understanding of genetic traits and, thus, the development of better breeding strategies.</p><p><strong>RESULTS:</strong> The authors assembled a telomere-to-telomere genome by combining PacBio HiFi, ONT ultra- long and Hi-C data. The final genome assembly was approximately 1.798 Gb, assigned to 11 chromosomes and genome completeness &gt;98%. Comparative genomic analysis suggested that <em>P. praeruptorum</em> experienced two WGD events like the ones in the Apiaceae family. By the transcriptomic and metabolomic analysis of the coumarin metabolic pathway, we presented coumarins' spatial and temporal distribution and the expression patterns of critical genes for its biosynthesis. Notably, the <em>COSY</em> and cytochrome <em>P450</em> genes showed tandem duplications on several chromosomes, which may be responsible for the high accumulation of coumarins.</p><p><strong>CONCLUSIONS:</strong> The authors obtained a T2T genome for <em>P. praeruptorum</em>, which provides molecular insights into the chromosomal distribution of the coumarin biosynthetic genes. This high-quality genome is an essential resource for designing engineering strategies for improving the production of these valuable compounds.</p>",

The plant growth site was situated amidst the Huai and Yangtze Rivers, commonly called the Jianghuai area. Fresh, young and healthy leaves were harvested for the extraction of high-molecular-weight genomic DNA using a modified cetyltri-methylammonium bromide (CTAB) method and nuclei method, respectively, for short reads and long reads (PacBio and Nanopore ultra-long) sequencing. Samples from leaves, stems, roots, flowers and fruit tissues at 3 different growth stages were utilized for RNA extraction employing a RNeasy PowerWater Kit (Qiagen, Carlsbad, CA, USA).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Metabolic analysis</strong></p><p>A total of 66 tissues were collected for metabolic analysis. Per the transcriptome samples, each tissue was represented by 6 biological replicates. The metabolite profiling from each tissue was performed using a nontargeted metabolomics approach, following an established protocol<strong>[1]</strong>. High-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) was conducted using an ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) system followed by The Q Exactive Plus Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap Mass Spectrometer (MS).</p><p><br></p><p>The experiment involved a total of 33 samples, including 3 different tissue types at different growth stages: Vegetative growth stage (VP) - root, stem, leaf; Flowering stage (AP) - root, stem, leaf, flower; Fruiting stage (FP) - root, stem, leaf, fruit. Altogether 3 biological replicates represented each tissue type.</p><p><br></p><p>Select representative stems for collection. The collection position can be determined based on the plant's growth form and the desired research part. Choose fully opened and undamaged flowers for collection. On the premise of ensuring the integrity of the plant root system, try to collect the complete root system and preserve the stem connected to the root system.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Tohge T, Fernie AR.
