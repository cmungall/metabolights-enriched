                "description": "This dataset reports the UPLC-QTof MS untargeted analysis of Vitis vinifera L. leaves, collected from Italy (Trentino) and Germany (Mecklenburg West-Pomerania), from two fungus-resistant grape varieties (PIWI), Regent and Phoenix. For each variety, 40 leaves were sampled from 10 plants (4 leaves/plant) in Italy, and other 40 with the same process in Germany. The leaves from each plant were homogenized and extracted separately, in the same day, under a randomized order. A quality control (QC) sample was prepared by pooling a small aliquot from each sample. </p> The aim of the project, was to use this sample/data set as an illustrative example for the use the pipeline MetaDB (https://github.com/rmylonas/MetaDB). MetaDB has been developed in order to combine, with a user-friendly web based, different bioinformatic tools used in metabolomics, which takes care a) metadata organization, b) creation of randomized sequences including QC sample, c) data quality evaluation, d) data storage organization, e) data analysis and f) submission to public repositories.",

For each variety/country condition, 4 leaves (not growing any more) per plant were collected, from 10 plants, from the same insertion level. The leaves from each plant were pooled together, frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 \u00b0C, until analysis. The sampling was made for both countries in July 2012, and German samples were packed in dry ice and shipped to Italy within 24 hr.",

The extraction mixture was vortexed for 1 min, sonicated for 10 min, shaken for 15 min at room temperature using an orbital shaker (Grant-Bio Rotator PTR-60) and centrifuged at 4 \u00b0C and 1000 x g for 10 min. 1.5 ml of the upper aqueous methanolic phase was filtered into LC-MS certificated vials through a 0.2 \u00b5m filter and analyzed. To avoid bias, the extractions were performed according to a randomized sequence using the sequence calculation platform \u201cwww.randomization.org\u201d [1]. QC samples were obtained by mixing an aliquot of the powder obtained from the different samples.\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Ehrhardt C, Arapitsas P, Stefanini M, Flick G, Mattivi F.

Mass spectrometric data were collected in positive ESI mode over a mass range of 50 to 2000 amu with scan duration of 0.3 s in centroid mode. The transfer collision energy and trap collision energy were set at 6 V and 4 V respectively. The source parameters were set as follows: capillary 3 kV, sampling cone 25 V, extraction cone 3 V, source temperature 150 \u00baC, desolvation temperature 500 \u00baC, desolvation gas flow 1000 l/h and nebulizer gas 50 l/h. External calibration of the instrument was performed at the beginning of each batch of analysis by direct infusion of a sodium formate solution (10% formic acid/0.1 M NaOH/Acetonitrile at a ratio of 1/1/8), controlling the mass accuracy from 40 to 2000 m/z (less than 5 ppm) and mass resolution (over 14000 FWHM). LockMass calibration was applied using a solution of leucine enkephaline (0.5 mg/l, m/z 556.2771) at 0.1 ml/min [1].\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Arapitsas P, Speri G, Angeli A, Perenzoni D, Mattivi F.
