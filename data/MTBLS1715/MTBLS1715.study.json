                "description": "<p>High-affinity iron (Fe) scavenging compounds, or siderophores, are widely employed by soil bacteria to survive scarcity in bioavailable Fe. Siderophore biosynthesis relies on cellular carbon metabolism, despite reported decrease in both carbon uptake and Fe-containing metabolic proteins in Fe-deficient cells. Given this paradox, the metabolic network required to sustain the Fe-scavenging strategy is poorly understood. Here, through multiple <sup>13</sup>C-metabolomics experiments with Fe-replete and Fe-limited cells, we uncover how soil <em>Pseudomonas</em> species reprogram their metabolic pathways to prioritize siderophore biosynthesis. Across the three species investigated (<em>Pseudomonas putida</em> KT2440, <em>Pseudomonas protegens</em> Pf-5, and <em>Pseudomonas putida</em> S12), siderophore secretion is higher during growth on gluconeogenic substrates than during growth on glycolytic substrates. In response to Fe limitation, we capture decreased flux toward the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle during the metabolism of glycolytic substrates but, due to carbon recycling to the TCA cycle via enhanced anaplerosis, the metabolism of gluconeogenic substrates results in an increase in both siderophore secretion (up to threefold) and Fe extraction (up to sixfold) from soil minerals. During simultaneous feeding on the different substrate types, Fe deficiency triggers a hierarchy in substrate utilization, which is facilitated by changes in protein abundances for substrate uptake and initial catabolism. Rerouted metabolism further promotes favorable fluxes in the TCA cycle and the gluconeogenesis-anaplerosis nodes, despite decrease in several proteins in these pathways, to meet carbon and energy demands for siderophore precursors in accordance with increased proteins for siderophore biosynthesis. Hierarchical carbon metabolism thus serves as a critical survival strategy during the metal nutrient deficiency.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Data availability:</strong></p><p>The proteomics data have been deposited into the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository with the data set identifier <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD013605' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>PXD013605</a>.</p>",

Liquid cell cultures, which were prepared using individual colonies selected from the plates and resuspended in LB medium in 20 mL glass tubes and 125 mL baffled flasks inside of a G24 incubator shaker (New Brunswick Scientific, Edison, NJ) at 220 rpm and 30\u00b0C. The volume of the suspended cells did not exceed one-fifth of the culturing vessels, which were covered with sponge caps to enable gas exchange and prevent contamination. The growth medium, which was filter-sterilized and pH-adjusted (pH 7.0), contained major salts and trace metal salts as detailed previously (Wushensky et al., 2018). Disodium ethylene-diamine-tetra-acetic-acid (EDTA) was added as a Fe chelator; dissolved Fe concentrations were determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES, Spectro Analytical) and the EDTA concentration to be used was determined using the software Visual MINTEQ (version 3.1) to simulate metal speciation in the growth medium composition [1]. The cells were grown under intermediate Fe-limited condition with 650 nM total dissolved unchelated Fe, or Fe-limited with 38 nM total dissolved unchelated Fe\u2014unchelated here means unchelated by EDTA.&nbsp;Total carbon-equivalent substrate concentrations (100 mM C or 300 mM C total) were provided as glucose (16.67 mM or 50 mM), succinate (25 mM or 75 mM), or 1:1 mixture with glucose and benzoate (respectively, 8.33 mM and 7.14 mM).</p><p>For each growth condition, the cells (three biological replicates) were transferred twice in the growth medium to ensure the cells were acclimated in the specific medium composition. Biomass growth was monitored by measuring the optical density at 600 nm (OD600) using an Agilent Cary UV-visible spectrophotometer (Santa Clara, California). An exponential growth rate (h-1) was determined via regression analysis. Measurement of cell dry weight in grams (gCDW) as a function of exponential OD600 was obtained following lyophilization of sample aliquots (1.5 mL) using a Labconco (Kansas City, MO, USA) Freeze-Dryer System.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p>[1] Kim, B.

The supernatants were stored at 4\u00b0C until analysis for simultaneous quantification of glucose and benzoate by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) using a Varian Unity INOVA 600-MHz NMR spectrometer at 25\u00b0C, as described previously [1]. Substrate assimilation was confirmed by metabolite labeling of substrate-derived carbons. For monitoring extracellular metabolic excretion, samples (three biological replicates) were harvested at several time points throughout the growth phase. Filtered supernatants (50-\u00b5L) were diluted 1:10 during the growth phase and 1:100 during stationary phase with LC-MS grade water (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) before analysis via LC-MS. Adjusted dilution ratios were used to account for higher concentrations of extracellular metabolites. The samples were stored at 4\u00b0C prior to processing via LC\u2013 MS.

Briefly, filtered aliquots (3-mL) of liquid cultures grown on medium with unlabeled substrates were first transferred to plates with the same agar-solidified medium composition, and the cell-containing filters were transferred subsequently during exponential growth to plates containing labeled substrates as [U- 13C6]-glucose or [U-13C4]-succinate. At specific time points (5, 10, or 15 min), metabolism was quenched, and the cellular metabolites were analyzed via LC\u2013MS. Prior to LCMS analysis, 100-\u00b5L aliquots of the supernatant was dried under N2 gas followed by re-suspension in 100-\u00b5L LC\u2013MS water.</p><p>We also monitored long-term intracellular incorporation of substrates by growing liquid cultures for at least two doubling times in media solutions containing [1,4-13C2]-succinate alone, [U13C4]-succinate with unlabeled glucose, [U-13C6]-glucose with unlabeled succinate, [U-13C6]-glucose with unlabeled citrate, or [U-13C6]-glucose with unlabeled benzoate. Additionally, for the cells grown on [U-13C6]-glucose with unlabeled benzoate, the 13C-labeling patterns and the metabolite levels were determined at 4.5 hours for the intermediate Fe-limited condition and 3.5, 5 and 6.5 hours for the Fe-limited condition.</p><p><br></p><p>Long-term intracellular data for [U-13C6]-glucose with unlabeled benzoate under Fe-limited&nbsp;conditions or intermediate Fe-limited conditions have been deposited as derived data files (.mzXml) and kinetic data with [U-13C6]-glucose or [U-13C4]-succinate, and long-term intracellular data with [1,4-13C2]-succinate alone, [U13C4]-succinate with unlabeled glucose, [U-13C6]-glucose with unlabeled succinate, [U-13C6]-glucose with unlabeled citrate have been deposited as derived (.xlsx) files.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p>[1] Kukurugya, M.

A Waters Acquity UPLC BEH C18 1.7\u00b5m with a column size of 2.1 \u00d7 100 mm) (Waters Corporation, Massachusetts) was used. Solvent A contained 97:3 (v:v) LC-MS grade H2O: methanol with acetic acid (15mM) and tributylamine (10mM). Solvent B contained 100% methanol. The flow rate was 180\u00b5L min\u22121 during the entire sample run (25 min). The solvent gradient with respect to solvent Awas the following: 0min, 100%; 2.5 min, 100%; 5 min, 80%; 7.5 min, 80%; 10 min, 45%; 12 min, 45%; 14 min, 5%; 17 min, 5%; 18 min, 0%; 25 min, 0% was run. All metabolite identification and isotopic enrichment were determined using the Metabolomics Analysis and Visualization Engine (MAVEN) software package. Corrections for natural abundance of 13C were conducted on the 13C-labeled fractions. The following metabolites and amino acids were monitored: gluconate, glucose-6-phosphoate, fructose-6-phosphoate, 6-phosphogluconate, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, dihydroxy-acetone-phosphate, 3-phosphoglycerate, phosphoenolpyruvate, pyruvate, aspartate, malate, fumarate, succinate, a-ketoglutarate and citrate. Metabolite levels and 13C labeling patterns were retrieved using the Metabolomics Analysis and Visualization Engine (MAVEN) software package. For the labeled data, 13C-labeled fractions were corrected for natural 13C abundance. Aspartate labeling was taken as a surrogate for oxaloacetate (OAA) labeling due to the direct synthesis of aspartate from OAA. Reference standards were a mixture of monitored metabolites purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.</p>",
