                "description": "White tea is considered the least processed form of tea and is reported to have a series of potent bioactivities, such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-mutagenic, and anti-cancer activities. However, the chemical composition of white tea and the dynamic changes of the metabolites during the manufacturing process are far from clear. In this study, we applied a nontargeted metabolomics approach based on ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry to comprehensively profile the characteristic metabolites of white tea. There were significant differences in the content of amino acids, catechins, dimeric catechins, flavonol and flavone glycosides, and aroma precursors in white tea compared with green and black teas that were manufactured from the same fresh tea leaves. Furthermore, the dynamic changes of the metabolites in the tea samples with various withering durations of 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, and 36 h were also profiled. To the best of our knowledge, this study offers the most comprehensive characterization of the metabolites and their changes in white tea.",

The manufacturing process was as described below. For the sampling, one part of the tea sample was collected. The sampling was repeated 6 times for the manufactured teas (green, white, and black teas) and was repeated 3 times for the tea samples with various withering times (0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, and 28 hr).\n</p>\nWhite tea:</br>\n40 kg fresh tea leaves were withered at 30 \u00baC and a relative humidity of 47% for 36 hr, and then dried at 120 \u00baC for 20 min and 80 \u00baC for 20-30 min to a moisture content of approximately 5%.\n</p>\nGreen tea:</br>\nThe manufacturing process of green tea was modified from a previous work. Briefly, after withering for 2 hr, the tea leaves were fixed using a rotary continuous fixation machine to terminate the activities of the endogenous enzymes. Then, the leaves were rolled for 1 hr before they were dried at 120 \u00b0C for 20 min and then at 80 \u00b0C for 20\u221230 min to a moisture content of approximately 5%.\n</p>\nBlack tea:</br>\nThe manufacturing process of black tea was modified from another previous work. After 12 hr of withering at 30 \u00baC and a relative humidity of 47%, a roller was used to roll the tea leaves for 80 min. Then, the tea leaves were fermented at 30 \u00b0C with a relative humidity of 90% in an environment-controlled cabinet with a fermentation duration of 4 hr, and then immediately dried to a moisture content of approximately 5% to terminate the fermentation using a hot air dryer at 120 \u00b0C for 20 min and then at 80 \u00b0C for 20\u221230 min.",
