                "description": "<p>Characterizing the mode of action of antimalarial compounds that emerge from high-throughput phenotypic screens is central to understanding how parasite resistance to these drugs can emerge. Here, we have employed untargeted metabolomics to inform on the mechanism of action of antimalarial leads with different speed of kill profiles being developed by the Novartis Institute of Tropical Diseases (NITD). Time-resolved global changes in malaria parasite metabolite profiles upon drug treatment were quantified using liquid chromatography-based mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and compared to untreated controls. Using this approach, we confirmed previously reported metabolomics profiles of the fast-killing (2.5 h) drug dihydroartemisinin (DHA) and the slower killing atovaquone (ATQ). A slow acting antimalarial lead from NITD of imidazolopiperazine (IZP) class, GNF179, elicited little or no discernable metabolic change in malaria parasites in the same 2.5 h window of drug exposure. In contrast, fast killing drugs, DHA and the spiroindolone (NITD246) elicited similar metabolomic profiles both in terms of kinetics and content. DHA and NITD246 induced peptide losses consistent with disruption of haemoglobin catabolism and also interfered with the pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway. Two members of the recently described novel class of antimalarial agents of the 5-aryl-2-amino-imidazothiadiazole (ITD) class also exhibited a fast-acting profile that also featured peptide losses indicative of disrupted haemoglobin catabolism. Our screen demonstrates that structurally unrelated, fast acting antimalarial compounds generate similar biochemical signatures in <em>Plasmodium</em> pointing to a common mechanism associated with rapid parasite death. These profiles may be used to identify and possibly predict the mode of action of other fast-acting drug candidates.</p>",

To enrich for \u223c24-30 h old trophozoites, a magnetic separation was employed as previously described<strong>[2]</strong>. Custom 3D printed magnet stands were assembled based on previously reported designs<strong>[2]</strong> and used to assemble a magnetic apparatus which was used to enrich for mature trophozoites in conjunction with cell separation LD columns (Miltenyi Biotech). Briefly, synchronized cultures at 5-7% parasitaemia (\u223c24-30 h old) were re-suspended to 8% haematocrit following which 5 mL was loaded into the LD columns on the magnetic stands and allowed to flow through. Uninfected and early-stage parasites were washed off by loading the LD column with 5 mL of clean complete media which allows for removal of all unbound RBCs. Bound parasites were then eluted in 5 mL of fresh complete media after removal of the LD columns from the magnetic stands. Eluted parasites were pooled into a single falcon tube from which cell counts (haemocytometer counting) were performed and adjusted to a concentration of \u223c1 x 10^8&nbsp;cells/mL. Purified parasites, containing &gt;90% purified trophozoites were allowed to recover for \u223c1 h at 37 \u00b0C at \u223c0.5% haematocrit before the start of experiments. Further quality and purity of the enriched trophozoites was assessed by microscopy analysis of methanol fixed Giemsa-stained smears.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Metabolite sample preparation</strong></p><p>Magnetically purified trophozoites as described above were exposed to DHA, NITD246 and inactive analogue (NITD246i); GNF179; Cpd 9 and inactive analogue Cpd 9_ia; Cpd 55 and inactive analogue Cpd 55_ia at 10X IC50. ATQ was used as a positive control while DMSO (0.1%) was used in untreated controls. In total 1 mL of purified trophozoites (1 x 10 cells) was mixed with 4 mL of complete media containing spiroindolones, KAF156, ITDs and ATQ at 10&nbsp;8x IC50&nbsp;in 6-well plates for 2.5 h initially. The concentration used and the time of exposure was based on our time kill kinetics of these compounds as well as previously validated drug concentration and corresponding timepoints which are known to achieve a better metabolic signal resolution<strong>[1][3][4]</strong>. To resolve the metabolic profiles of fast acting compounds at earlier timepoints, a similar approach as described above was used for DHA, NITD246 and Cpd 55 albeit with a dynamic drug exposure for 0.5, 1 and 2 h. Incubations at all timepoints were performed in triplicate over 2 biological repeats. After drug incubation, 4 mL of media was aspirated from the 6-well plates and cells were resuspended in 1 mL volume and centrifuged to pellet the cells. Metabolism was immediately quenched by aspirating the supernatant and resuspending the cells in ice cold 1X PBS. All experiments were performed on ice onwards.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Allman EL, Painter HJ, Samra J, Carrasquilla M, Llin\u00e1s M.

Samples were eluted on a linear gradient, starting with 20% A and 80% B for 15 min, followed by a 2 min wash with 95% A and 5% B, and 8 min re-equilibration with 20% A and 80% B, where solvent A is 20 mM ammonium carbonate in water while solvent B is acetonitrile. The LC-MS method was based on previously published protocols<strong>[1]</strong>. Mass spectrometry was operated in polarity switching mode at a resolution of 70,000, 106&nbsp;cts AGC target, spray voltages +3.8 and -3.8 kV, capillary temperature of 320 \u00b0C, heater temperature of 150 \u00b0C, sheath gas flow rate of 40 a.u., auxiliary gas flow rate of 5 a.u., sweep gas flow rate of 5 a.u., and a full scan mass window of 70-1050 m/z. m/z 83.0604, 149.0233 and 445.1200 were used as lock masses in the positive mode while m/z 89.0244 was used as a lock mass in the negative mode.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Mass spectrometry fragmentation</strong></p><p>Samples were also subjected to a fragmentation mass spectrometry analysis (LC-MS/MS) to allow for additional structural information on detected mass features. Fragmentation of the samples was carried out in either the positive or negative ionisation modes or both using duty cycles (1 full scan event and 1 top 5 or top 10 fragmentation event) as previously described<strong>[2]</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Data acquisition</strong></p><p>Control runs consisting of blank runs and standardised internal controls were run in accordance with standard procedures at the Glasgow Polyomics to monitor the performance of the mass spectrometer in terms of chromatography and mass intensities. A mixture of standards containing 150 reference compounds available from Glasgow Polyomics were also run to assess the quality of the mass spectrometer and to aid in metabolite annotation and identification<strong>[1]</strong>. Pooled samples containing fractional representation of samples were run prior to and across the batch every 6th&nbsp;sample to monitor the stability and quality of the LC-MS run, whereas the actual samples were run in a randomised manner to minimise batch effects. Thermo Xcalibur Tune software was used for instrument control and data acquisition.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Creek DJ, Jankevics A, Breitling R, Watson DG, Barrett MP, Burgess KE.
