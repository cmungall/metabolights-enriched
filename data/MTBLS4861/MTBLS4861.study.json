                "description": "<p>Ovarian cancer (OC) causes high mortality in women because of ineffective biomarkers for early diagnosis. Here, we perform metabolomics analysis on an initial training set of uterine fluid from 96 gynecological patients. A seven-metabolite-marker panel consisting of vanillylmandelic acid, norepinephrine, phenylalanine, beta-alanine, tyrosine, 12-S-hydroxy-5,8,10-heptadecatrienoic acid and crithmumdiol is established for detecting early-stage OC. The panel is further validated in an independent sample set from 123 patients, discriminating early OC from controls with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.957 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.894-1.000). Interestingly, we find elevated norepinephrine and decreased vanillylmandelic acid in most OC cells, resulting from excess 4-hydroxyestradiol that antagonizes the catabolism of norepinephrine by catechol-O-methyltransferase. Moreover, exposure to 4-hydroxyestradiol induces cellular DNA damage and genomic instability that could lead to tumorigenesis. Thus, this study not only reveals metabolic features in uterine fluid of gynecological patients but also establishes a noninvasive approach for the early diagnosis of OC. </p>",

Because of the absence of specific early symptoms, most patients are diagnosed at their late stages. Although a few biomarkers such as cancer antigen 125 and human epididymis protein 4 are used for ovarian cancer diagnosis, their low sensitivity and specificity cannot meet the demand of early detection. Neighboring ovarian surface and fallopian tube, uterine cavity pools secreted fluid enriched with amino acids, lipids, proteins, etc, potentially reflecting the status of adjacent organs with minimal interference from abdominal viscera. This study not only reveals metabolic features in uterine fluid of gynecological patients, but also establishes a newly noninvasive approach for early diagnosis of ovarian cancer.</p><p><br></p><p>Uterine flushing was performed according to previous protocols with minor modification<strong>[1][2]</strong>. With patients in the lithotomy position, the cervix was exposed by a sterile speculum and cleansed with sterile normal saline solution. A size 10 Foley catheter was placed in uterine cavity through the cervix and secured in place by inflating the balloon with 1 mL normal saline, followed by applying gentle traction to seal off the junction between uterine cavity and the cervical canal. Then 2 mL normal saline was slowly infused into uterine cavity through the catheter, left for 30 s before using gentle suction to harvest the fluid, and this procedure was repeated 5x times to ensure a thorough sampling of uterine cavity. The fluid collected each time was pooled together, subsequently aliquoted into 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes and stored at -80 \u00b0C. For each patient, multiple aliquots of equal amount (100 mL) of uterine fluid were used for metabolomics experiments and targeted tests.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Li TC, Ling E, Dalton C, Bolton AE, Cooke ID.

The aim of aqueous methanol extraction was to remove protein fractions while maximizing small molecule recovery. Samples from each patient were prepared in triplicate using the above method, as the resulting extracts were analyzed using reverse-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC)-mass spectrometry (MS) with electrospray ionization (ESI) positive and ESI negative modes, hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC)-MS with ESI positive mode.
