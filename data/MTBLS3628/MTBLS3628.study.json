                "description": "<p>Germline or somatic loss-of-function of fumarate hydratase (FH) predisposes patients to an aggressive form of renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Since other than tumor resection, there is no effective therapy for FH-deficient RCC, a competent method for early diagnosis and for early detection of recurrent and metastatic disease is an unmet clinical need. Currently, at best, an annual MRI scan is offered, though typically, MRI is used for symptomatic patients only. Therefore, finding specific and sensitive biomarkers suitable for routine and simple screens is crucial for improving the clinical outcome of these patients. Taking advantage of the robust metabolic rewiring that occurs in FH-deficient cells, we performed a large-scale study of plasma metabolomics comparing FH-deficient RCC patients to no-tumor control individuals or to wildtype FH RCC patients. Our results indicated two fumarate-derived metabolites, succinyl-adenosine and succinic-cysteine, to be outstanding plasma biomarkers for early diagnosis, with a positive predictive value of more than 90%. Furthermore, using pre-clinical and biochemical studies, we identified the enzymatic mechanisms by which these biomarkers are produced in and around the tumors.&nbsp;</p>",

IHC and DNA genetic sequencing were performed to confirm the wild type FH. The FH-deficient (FH-MT) renal cell carcinoma (RCC) included 77 patients from 15 centers were selected from our established cohort<strong>[1]</strong>. Total 77 patients covered 70 germline tumor and 7 sporadic, spanning all stages of tumors. They were confirmed by IHC and DNA genetic sequencing. Finally, 87 age and gender matched normal individuals were recruited as no-tumor controls (NC). Collectively 252 individuals from 16 centers, comprised the SHJTUCMRJ cohort.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Sample Inclusion</strong></p><p>Blood samples were collected from participants from each center. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant. The study was approved by the ethics committee in RENJI Hospital and abided by the ethical guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki. The samples were collected requiring neither the specific timing (morning or afternoon) nor restriction on fasting, sporting, alcohol consumption, etc. Quality control criteria for exclusion of samples was the hemolysis. Two from 270 samples were excluded due to hemolysis. Finally a total 268 human plasma samples were included in the study.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Study Design</strong></p><p>A total of 93 samples were enrolled as FH-deficient (FH-MT) RCC group. 10 samples from different patients covering stage I, II, III and IV at the collection time were selected as the discovery set and the rest 83 samples were selected as the validation set. A total of 88 samples were enrolled as FH-wildtype RCC (FH-WT) group. 10 samples from different patients covering stage I II III IV at the collection time were selected as the discovery set and the rest 78 samples covering different stage were selected as the validation set. A total of 87 samples were enrolled as Normal Control no tumor (NC) group. 10 samples from different individuals were randomly selected as the discovery set and the rest 77 samples were selected as the validation set.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Clinical Outcomes</strong></p><p>Patients came to visit the urologists for regular assessments (pathological examinations, radiologic examinations and laboratory tests) every 6-10 weeks. Treatment response and outcome was defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 guidelines. All imaging studies for tumor burden development on local lesion or metastatic lesion were performed, with RECIST 1.1 criteria assessed for all patients by a single radiologist.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Xu Y, Huang Y, Zhang J.

Metabolomics analysis (untargeted)</strong></p><p>First, we used self-built standard reference library, which contains accurate mass (m/z \u00b1 5 ppm), retention time (RT \u00b1 1.0 min) and MS/MS spectral patterns. Second, further remaining metabolites were identified based on accurate mass, isotope pattern and MS/MS spectra against public databases, including <strong>HMDB</strong>, <strong>KEGG</strong>, <strong>mzCloud</strong> and <strong>MassBank</strong>. In practice, the mass of metabolites was matched against the public database: <strong>HMDB</strong> and <strong>KEGG</strong>, using the cutoff value of 5 ppm. Next, for MS/MS data, if one metabolite feature matched multiple MS/MS spectra, then all matched MS/MS spectra were used for the identification. In the rare cases, when a given metabolic feature was matched differently between different matching methods, we chose the matching based on the identification level: Standards (accurate mass + retention time + MS/MS &gt; MS/MS (accurate mass + MS/MS) &gt; HMDB/KEGG (accurate mass)).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. Lipidomic analysis (untargeted)</strong></p><p><strong>LipidSearch</strong> database contains more than 30 lipid classes, with more than 1,700,000 fragments. Adducts of M+H, M+NH4 were selected for positive mode searches, while M-H, M-CH3COO were selected for negative mode searches since ammonium acetate was used in the mobile phases. The identification of lipids were mainly carried out in 4 steps. First, the parental ions and fragment ions were matched with the <strong>LipidSearch</strong> (mass tolerance = \u00b15 ppm). Second, the matched peaks were grouped based on the same molecular formula and retention time. Third, grades A, B, C, D were used to score each grouped peak (A=10, B=5, C=1, D=0.5; No ID = 0). Grade A indicates the full information including the head group, the carbon number of fatty acid chains, the degree of unsaturation and the position of the double bond. Grade B indicates the partial information including the head group, the carbon number of fatty acid chains and the degree of unsaturation. Grades C and D indicates the limited information including the head group of the lipid and the carbon number of the chain. Finally, the scores from highest to lowest were sorted and groups with lower scores will be eliminated.</p>",
