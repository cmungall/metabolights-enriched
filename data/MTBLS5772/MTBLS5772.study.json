                "description": "Trace elements are the result of natural and anthropogenic sources. Some of them are toxic causing alterations in the properties of membranes and produce lipid peroxidation. The dataset presented here is associated with the research article paper entitled \u201cTrace element and lipidomic analysis of bottlenose dolphin blubber from the Yucatan coast: Lipid composition relationships\u201d. In this article, we presented the trace element concentrations found in blubber and their comparison with other studies. Lipidomic characterization of bottlenose dolphin blubber and their association with trace elements and the differences related to biological characteristics. This data provides a correlation analysis between trace element concentrations and lipid species related to biological characteristics. We used Spearman correlation analysis to identify the association with body length and Wicolxon rank-sum test to determine differences in lipids related to stranding code, growth stage and stomach content. The data indicates that Cr, Cd and Zn concentrations were higher compared to other studies. Cr, Co, As and Cd were found in higher concentration in larger organisms. A decrease in some ceramides, sterols, glycerolipids and phosphatydilglyceros related to higher dolphins were found. Decomposition causes a decrease in phosphoethanolamines. Organisms with empty stomachs showed higher concentrations of phosphoethanolamines suggesting a preferential metabolism of energy-rich lipids over structural lipids. The information in these datasets may contribute to understanding the potential associations of trace element, lipid and their associations with biological characteristics.",

Biological data are presented in Table 1 in the paper associated with this study. The dolphins used in the present study had a mean body length of 218.36 \u00b1 47.20 cm. The strandings were attended by the Program of Investigation and Conservation of Marine Mammals of Yucatan (PICMMY-UADY) from Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Yucat\u00e1n. The samples were collected <em>in situ</em> from the lateral area, below the dorsal fin of dolphins, on the flank; except for dolphins Tt3, Tt6, Tt10 and Tt12, for which samples were collected from the lowest region of the dorsal fin. All the collected samples were authorized by the Secretary of Environmental and Natural Resources of Mexico (SEMARNAT) with permits No. SGPA/DGVS/02797/16, SGPA/DGVS/00403/17, SGPA/DGVS/007603/18 and SGPA/DGVS/06727/19. The samples were dissected, frozen and stored at -20 \u00b0C; later, they were lyophilized before analysis. Dolphins with assigned decomposition codes of 2 (recently dead) to 4 (advanced decomposition) were considered in this study.</p>",

First, 10 mg of blubber was homogenized with 1 mL of HPLC-grade water and 2 mL of methanol. Then, 0.9 mL of methylene chloride was added to the mixture in a glass screw-tube and stirred for 30 s. If a distinct phase appeared, 100 \u03bcL of methanol was added to obtain a monophasic solution. Next, 50 \u03bcL of the 5x diluted internal standard EquiSPLASH LIPIDOMIX (Avanti Polar Lipids, AL, USA) solution was added and the sample was vortexed and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Subsequently, 1 mL of water and 0.9 mL of methylene chloride were added. Samples were gently inverted 10x and then centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 10 min. The organic lower phase was carefully collected using a glass Pasteur pipette and concentrated to dryness under a N2 stream. Meanwhile, 2 mL of methylene chloride were added to the remaining solution and then centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 10 min. The organic lower phase was collected again, pooled, dried and reconstituted into 50 \u03bcL of 96% ethanol before analysis.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Bligh EG, Dyer WJ.

Chromatographic separation was carried out using a XBridge Amide column 3.5 \u03bcm, 4.6 x 150 mm (Waters, Ireland). Acetonitrile:water with a ratio of 95:5 (v/v) and 50:50 (v/v) were employed as mobile phases (A and B, respectively). Both solvents contained 1 mM/L ammonium acetate and the pH was adjusted to 8.2. The linear gradient of solvent B increased to 6% in 6 min, and then reached 25% within 4 min, 98% within 1 min, and finally 100% within 2 min. The flow rate was 0.7 mL/min and the injection volume was 5 \u03bcL. After each separation, the column was flushed using mobile phase B at a flow rate of 1.5 mL/min for 3 min, the needle was washed using 500 \u03bcL isopropanol and blanks were run in sample intervals. The effluent was transferred to the ion source using nanoViper fittings and tubing with 100 \u03bcM ID (nanoViper capillary IDXL, ThermoScientific).</p>",
