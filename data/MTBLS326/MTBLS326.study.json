                "description": "1H NMR is used to detect alterations in metabolites and their linkage to metabolic processes in a number of pathological conditions including breast cancer. Inositol 1, 4, 5 trisphosphate (IP3R) receptor is an intracellular calcium channel known to regulate metabolism and cellular bioenergetics. Its expression is up regulated in a number of cancers. However, its linkage to metabolism in disease conditions has not been evaluated. This study was designed to determine the association if any, of these metabolites with altered expression of IP3R in breast cancer. We used 1H NMR to identify metabolites in the serum of breast cancer patients (n = 27) and performed Real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction analysis for quantifying the expression of IP3R type 3 and type 2 in tissues from breast cancer patients (n = 40). Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Partial Least Square-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) clearly distinguished patients with high/low IP3R expression from healthy subjects. The present study revealed high expression of IP3R type 2 and type 3 in human breast tumor tissue compared to adjacent non-tumorous tissue. Moreover, patients with = 2-fold increase in IP3R (high IP3R group) had significantly higher concentration of metabolic intermediates compared to those with < 2-fold increase in IP3R (low IP3R group). We observed an increase in lipoprotein content and the levels of metabolites like lactate, lysine and alanine and a decrease in the levels of pyruvate and glucose in serum of high IP3R group patients when compared to those in healthy subjects. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to show the clinical utility of metabolites. In addition to the human studies, functional relevance of IP3Rs in causing metabolic disruption was observed in MCF-7 and MDA MB-231 cells. Results from our studies bring forth the importance of metabolic (or metabolomics) profiling of serum by 1H NMR in conjunction with tissue expression studies for characterizing breast cancer patients. The results from this study provide new insights into relationship of breast cancer metabolites with IP3R.",

Blood was also obtained from healthy volunteers for use in metabolomics studies. The study recruited 40 breast cancer patients from whom tissue samples were obtained post-operatively. Out of these subjects only 27 blood samples were available for analysis. Tissues were collected from the tumor zone (tissue within the tumor boundary) and the normal zone (distal normal tissue at least 10 mm from the outer tumor boundary). A fraction of each tissue was fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin for routine histopathological analysis. The remaining tissue samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored at -80 \u00b0C for RNA analysis. The study also recruited 15 age matched healthy controls who volunteered to provide blood sample for the study. Serum samples obtained after centrifugation (at 3000 rpm, 4 \u00b0C for 10 min) of the blood samples were stored at -80 \u00b0C for subsequent NMR experiments.",
