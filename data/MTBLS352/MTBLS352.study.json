                "description": "<p>The relationship between dyslipidemia and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) has been extensively reported, but the global lipid profiles, especially in the East Asia population, associated with the development of T2D remain to be characterized. Liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry was applied to detect the global lipidome in the fasting plasma of 293 Chinese individuals, including 114 T2D patients, 81 prediabetic subjects and 98 individuals with normal glucose tolerance (NGT). Both qualitative and quantitative analyses revealed a gradual change in plasma lipid features with T2D patients exhibiting characteristics close to those of prediabetic individuals, whereas they differed significantly from individuals with NGT. We constructed and validated a random forest classifier with 28 lipidomic features that effectively discriminated T2D from NGT or prediabetes. Most of the selected features significantly correlated with diabetic clinical indices. Hydroxybutyrylcarnitine was positively correlated with fasting plasma glucose, 2-hour postprandial glucose, glycated hemoglobin and insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR). Lysophosphatidylcholines such as lysophosphatidylcholine (18:0), lysophosphatidylcholine (18:1) and lysophosphatidylcholine (18:2) were all negatively correlated with HOMA-IR. The altered plasma lipidome in Chinese T2D and prediabetic subjects suggests that lipid features may play a role in the pathogenesis of T2D and that such features may provide a basis for evaluating risk and monitoring disease development.</p>",

Intensity of each peak was normalized with all compounds, and produce peak intensities for retention time and m/z data pairs. Further data preprocessing was performed with the normalized peak intensities using in-house software metaX. To reduce redundant and produce comparable peaks, retention time (0.5-9.0 min) and peak width (1-30 s) tolerance were configured with Progenesis QI. To further improve the data quality, the number of zeros being &lt;50% of QC samples or &lt;80% of real samples were removed, the remaining zero values were replaced with kNN algorithm (k-Nearest Neighbor). Principal components analysis (PCA) for outlier detection was also performed with MetaX on the pre-processed dataset. To minimize the signal intensity drift over time, the QC-RLSC (Quality control-based robust LOESS signal correction), which is fitted to the QC data with respect to the order of injection, was conducted. In addition, relative standard deviations (RSD) for metabolic features were calculated across all QC samples. Those features with RSDs &gt;30% were then removed.</p>",

The metabolites which could be matched to LIPID MAPS, LipidBlast or aliphatic compounds of HMDB at level of Molecular Framework were considered as lipids and lipid-like features. DDA analysis which covered the desired mass scan range of interested m/z was performed to further aid in metabolite identification. The reported molecules were classified to Metabolomics Standards Initiative (MSI) levels according to the reporting guidelines.",
