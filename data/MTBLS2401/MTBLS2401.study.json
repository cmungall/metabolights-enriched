                "description": "<p>Grape juice is a major source of potential health-promoting bioactive polyphenols, especially for children and those who do not consume wine. Since the subtropical climate may negatively affect the concentrations of grape polyphenols, especially anthocyanins, elicitors such as methyl jasmonate (MeJa) could be used to promote polyphenol biosynthesis. This work aimed at investigating the impact of MeJa treatment on grape juice produced <em>via</em> a traditional low-cost process from two <em>Vitis labrusca</em> cultivars and in two Brazilian regions. The untargeted LC-MS analytical protocol demonstrated that Isabel Precoce juices strongly benefited from MeJa treatment, especially regarding their anthocyanic profile, regardless of the cultivation region. Known MeJa markers in wine and <em>V. vinifera</em> grapes (flavanols, flavonols and stilbenes) in this experiment had mixed behaviours depending on the region/variety/cultivation. Moreover, it was found that all the detected hydroxycinnamates were influenced by the treatment, especially the concentration of their glucosides, which was increased. Glutathione, 2-S-glutathionyl caftaric acid and indole lactic acid glucoside were identified for the first time as MeJa treatment biomarkers in grape products, indicating a possible positive effect on juice antioxidant properties.</p>",

In the southeast, the experiment was performed in Caldas (21\u00b0 55\u2032 23\u2033 S and 46\u00b0 23\u2032 15\u2033 W, 1.131 m altitude), in a 7-year-old vineyard of Isabel Precoce and Concord trained on a vertical shoot positioning system with a between-row and within-row spacing of 2.5 x 1.5 m. In the south, the experiments were performed in Bento Gon\u00e7alves (29\u00b0 10\u2032 26\u2033 S and 51\u00b0 31\u2032 7\u2033 W, 671 m altitude) in a 5-year-old commercial vineyard of Isabel Precoce grapes and a 20-year-old vineyard of Concord trained on a tendone system with a between-row and within-row spacing of 2.8 x 1.5 m. For each region/cultivar 2 blocks were used, control versus treatment. For the south region, each block comprised 10 vines and 18 vines for the southeast (<strong>Figure S1A</strong>).</p><p><br></p><p>The MeJa solution was prepared and applied (<strong>Figure S1B</strong>), as described previously<strong>[1]</strong>, at a concentration of 10 mM of MeJa dissolved in water. While pure water was used for control group. Approximately 50 mL of treated solution were applied directly into the cluster by spraying at veraison with 3 applications (on days 1, 3 and 6), plus a single application approximately 2 weeks before harvest (approximately 15,5\u00b0 Brix). The treatments were applied at least 2 h before rain.</p><p><br></p><p>The cultivar was manually destemmed and processed separately. The juice was extracted with a steam juicer, as described previously<strong>[2]</strong>. For each cultivar, 10 kg of berries were placed in the extraction chamber, and the juice extraction was accomplished with water vapor for 75 min. Followed by hot bottling in sterilized glass bottles closed with screw caps (<strong>Figure S1C</strong>). The juice samples were produced from the fruits of treated (MeJa) and control groups, processing in triplicate, generating 3 lots for each block. Juice samples were stored for 6 months at -20 \u00b0C, transported to Italy at -20 \u00b0C and kept at -80 \u00b0C until analysis.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Moro L, Da Ros A, da Mota RV, Purgatto E, Mattivi F, Arapitsas P.

Mass spectrometric data were collected by different runs in positive and negative ESI mode over a mass range 50-2000 amu with scan duration of 0.3 s in centroid mode. The transfer collision energy and trap collision energy were set at 6 and 4 V, respectively. The source parameters were set as follows: capillary 3 kV for positive scan and 2.5 kV for negative scan, sampling cone 25 V, extraction cone 3 V, source temperature 150 \u00baC, desolvation temperature 500 \u00baC, desolvation gas flow 1000 L/h and nebulizer gas 50 L/h. External calibration of the instrument was performed at the beginning of each batch of analysis by direct infusion of a sodium formate solution (10% formic acid/0.1 M NaOH/Acetonitrile at a ratio of 1/1/8) by controlling the mass accuracy from 40 to 2000 m/z (less than 5 ppm) and mass resolution (over 14000 FWHM). LockMass calibration was applied using a solution of leucine enkephaline (0.5 mg/L, m/z 556.2771 for positive and m/z 554.2620 for negative ion mode) at 0.1 mL/min.&nbsp;</p>",
