                "description": "<p>Gut microbiota can modulate nutrient metabolism, considerably affecting host growth and development. However, mechanisms by which gut microbiota regulate large yellow croaker (LYC; Larimichthys crocea) growth remain unclear. We assessed gut contents of fast-growing male (IWHM) and female (IWHF) LYCs and slow-growing male (IWLM) and female (IWLF) LYCs and subjected the data to metagenomic and metabolomic analyses. Gut microbiota composition significantly differed among LYCs with different growth rates: Vibrio abundance was considerably lower in IWHM LYCs (2.53%) than in IWLM LYCs (41.47%); Arthrobacter D abundance was the highest in IWHF LYCs (8.19%) but the lowest in IWLF LYCs (1.52%). Moreover, 124 and 483 differential metabolites were noted in IWHM-IWLM and IWHF-IWLF LYC pairs, respectively. Finally, we established a model for gut microbiota-metabolite relationship in LYCs to understand molecular mechanisms by which gut microbiota regulates nutrient metabolism. Our results highlight differences in gut microbiota between LYCs with high and low growth rates and provide comprehensive insights into molecular mechanisms underlying LYC growth regulation by gut microbiota.</p>",

Mobile phase composition A: water + 25 mM ammonium acetate + 25 mM ammonia water, B: acetonitrile; The gradient elution procedure was as follows: 0.0-0.5 min, 95% B; B changed linearly from 95% to 65% in 0.5-7.0 min; At 7.0-8.0 min, B changed linearly from 65% to 40%; B was maintained at 40% for 8.0-9.0 min; B changed linearly from 40% to 95% in 9.0-9.1 min; 9.1-12.0 min, B was maintained at 95%; The samples were placed in an autosampler at 4 \u00b0C throughout the analysis. In order to avoid the influence caused by the fluctuation of the instrument detection signal, the samples were consecutively analyzed in random order. QC samples were inserted into the sample cohort to monitor and evaluate the stability of the system and the reliability of the experimental data.</p>",
