                "description": "<p>Arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) is known to be a mutually beneficial plant-fungal symbiosis; however, the effect of mycorrhization is heavily dependent on multiple biotic and abiotic factors. Therefore, for the proper employment of such plant-fungal symbiotic systems in agriculture, a detailed understanding of the molecular basis of the plant developmental response to mycorrhization is needed. The aim of this work was to uncover the physiological and metabolic alterations in pea (<em>Pisum sativum L.</em>) leaves associated with mycorrhization at key plant developmental stages. Plants of pea cv. Finale were grown in constant environmental conditions under phosphate deficiency. The plants were analyzed at six distinct time points, which corresponded to certain developmental stages of the pea: I: 7 days post inoculation (DPI) when the second leaf is fully unfolded with one pair of leaflets and a simple tendril; II: 21 DPI at first leaf with two pairs of leaflets and a complex tendril; III: 32 DPI when the floral bud is enclosed; IV: 42 DPI at the first open flower; V: 56 DPI when the pod is filled with green seeds; and VI: 90-110 DPI at the dry harvest stage. Inoculation with <em>Rhizophagus irregularis</em> had no effect on the fresh or dry shoot weight, the leaf photochemical activity, accumulation of chlorophyll a, b or carotenoids. However, at stage III (corresponding to the most active phase of mycorrhiza development), the number of internodes between cotyledons and the youngest completely developed leaf was lower in the inoculated plants than in those without inoculation. Moreover, inoculation extended the vegetation period of the host plants, and resulted in increase of the average dry weight per seed at stage VI. The leaf metabolome, as analyzed with GC-MS, included about three hundred distinct metabolites and showed a strong correlation with plant age, and, to a lesser extent, was influenced by mycorrhization. Metabolic shifts influenced the levels of sugars, amino acids and other intermediates of nitrogen and phosphorus metabolism. The use of unsupervised dimension reduction methods showed that (i) at stage II, the metabolite spectra of inoculated plants were similar to those of the control, and (ii) at stages IV and V, the leaf metabolic profiles of inoculated plants shifted towards the profiles of the control plants at earlier developmental stages. At stage IV the inoculated plants exhibited a higher level of metabolism of nitrogen, organic acids, and lipophilic compounds in comparison to control plants. Thus, mycorrhization led to the retardation of plant development, which was also associated with higher seed biomass accumulation in plants with an extended vegetation period. The symbiotic crosstalk between host plant and AM fungi leads to alterations in several biochemical pathways the details of which need to be elucidated in further studies.</p>",

Finale</em> (Cebeco, Rotterdam, The Netherlands) with dark green leaves, white flowers and round green seeds<strong>[1]</strong> was used to study Arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) mediated metabolic alterations in leaves. This cultivar was used because of its stable yields and wide adaptation<strong>[1]</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p>The fungal isolate <em>Rhizophagus irregularis</em> BEG144 used in the study was previously characterized as forming highly effective AM symbioses with many agricultural crops.</p><p><br></p><p>Pea seeds were surface-disinfected as follows: 1 min in 96% ethanol, a rinse with sterile water, 8 min in a 5% NaClO aqueous solution, and a thorough rinse with sterile water. Disinfected pea seeds were germinated on sterile humid vermiculite in Petri dishes for 3 days at 27 \u00b0C in the dark. 2 pea seedlings of equal size were planted into a 300-ml ceramic flower pot with the growth substrate consisting of sterile soil and quartz sand mixture (1:2 v/v), supplemented with 1 g/l Ca3PO4 as a source of phosphate. Half of the pots were supplemented with 15 g/l <em>R. irregularis</em> inoculum before planting; the other half was left as control.</p><p><br></p><p>The plants were analyzed at 6 points in time, which corresponded to specific developmental stages for the growth of this species. I (7 days post inoculation, DPI); II (21 DPI); III (32 DPI); IV (42 DPI); V (56 DPI); and VI (90\u2013110 DPI).</p><p><br></p><p>At stages II, IV and V, 10 or more plants per treatment were taken at random at each stage. The plants were removed from the soil and their root systems thoroughly washed. The total fresh weight, the fresh weight of the aerial part of the plants and the number of internodes were determined. After measuring the growth parameters, the youngest fully-developed leaf from each analyzed plant was cut off. Leaves from 3 to 5 plants were allocated to a single biological replicate, weighed and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen in 2 ml Eppendorf Safe-Lock tube, and then stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. At least 3 biological replicates for each time point were collected. At stage VI, the aerial parts of all remaining plants were collected and their dry weight was measured after drying at room temperature for 3 months.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Engvild KC.

In addition, the AMDIS (Automated Mass Spectral Deconvolution and Identification System, NIST, USA) were used. The following mass-spectrometer libraries were applied: NIST2010, the library of the Resource Center of the Science Park 'Center for Molecular and Cell Technologies' (St. Petersburg University), the Golm Metabolome Database (GMD) and MoNA (Massbank of North America). Retention index (RI) was determined by calibration with standard alkanes.</p>",
