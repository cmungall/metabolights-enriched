                "description": "Hypoxia represents a major physiological challenge for prawns and is a problem in aquaculture. Therefore, an understanding of the metabolic response mechanism of economically important prawn species to hypoxia and re-oxygenation is essential. However, little is known about the intrinsic mechanisms by which the oriental river prawn Macrobrachium nipponense copes with hypoxia at the metabolic level. In this study, we conducted gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-based metabolomics studies and assays of energy metabolism-related parameters to investigate the metabolic mechanisms in the hepatopancreas of M. nipponense in response to 2.0 O2/L hypoxia for 6 and 24 h, and reoxygenation for 6 h following hypoxia for 24 h. Prawns under hypoxic stress displayed higher glycolysis-related enzyme activities and lower mRNA expression levels of aerobic respiratory enzymes than those in the normoxic control group, and those parameters returned to control levels in the reoxygenated group. Our results showed that hypoxia induced significant metabolomic alterations in the prawn hepatopancreas within 24 h. The main metabolic alterations were depletion of amino acids and 2-hydroxybutanoic acid and accumulation of lactate. Further, the findings indicated that hypoxia disturbed energy metabolism and induced antioxidant defense regulation in prawns. Surprisingly, recovery from hypoxia (i.e., reoxygenation) significantly affected 25 metabolites. Some amino acids (valine, leucine, isoleucine, lysine, glutamate, and methionine) were markedly decreased compared to the control group, suggesting that increased degradation of amino acids occurred to provide energy in prawns at reoxygenation conditions. This study describes the acute metabolomic alterations that occur in prawns in response to hypoxia and demonstrates the potential of the altered metabolites as biomarkers of hypoxia.",

The hypoxic dissolved oxygen (DO) value was chosen based on previous observations of juvenile oriental river prawn. DO and temperature were measured using a water-quality instrument (YSI Inc., Yellow Springs, OH, USA). 600 prawns were randomly allocated to 12 tanks (4 treatments were conducted in triplicate): <strong>hypoxia for 0 h (control)</strong>, <strong>severe hypoxia for 6 h</strong>, <strong>severe hypoxia for 24 h</strong>, or <strong>severe hypoxia for 24 h followed by recovery in normoxic conditions for 6 h</strong>. The mortality rate was 10% during experiment period. The hepatopancreas samples in each group (in triplicate) were also collected for the biochemical and gene expression assays (n = 9), and the other hepatopancreas samples in each group (in triplicate) were also stored at -80 \u00b0C until the metabolomics assays were conducted (n = 8).

A 1 \u03bcl aliquot of the analyte was injected in a splitless mode. Helium was used as the carrier gas. The front inlet purge flow was 3 ml/min, and the gas flow rate through the column was 1 ml/min. The initial temperature was kept at 50 \u00b0C for 1 min, then raised to 290 \u00b0C at a rate of 20 \u00b0C/min, then kept for 12 min at 290 \u00b0C. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Li T, Li E, Suo Y, Xu Z, Jia Y, Qin JG, Chen L, Gu Z.

We refined this analysis by obtaining the first principal component of variable importance projection values, with values &gt;1.0 selected as changed metabolites. In step 2, the remaining variables were then assessed using <strong>Student's t-test</strong> (P &lt; 0.05)<strong>[1]-[3]</strong>.
