                "description": "Xenobiotics are ubiquitous in the environment and modified abundantly in the human body by phase I and II metabolism. Liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry is a powerful tool to investigate these biotransformation products. Here, we present a workflow based on stable isotope-assisted metabolomics and the bioinformatics tool MetExtract II for deciphering all measureable xenobiotic metabolites produced by human cells in vitro in an untargeted manner. The value of this workflow is demonstrated by the detailed investigation of the metabolism of deoxynivalenol (DON), an abundant food contaminant, in two cell models (HepG2, HT29). Detected known metabolites included DON-3-sulfate, DON-10-sulfonate, and DON-10-glutathione as well as DON-cysteine. Conjugation with amino acids and antibiotics was observed and confirmed for the first time. The approach allows for the generic and untargeted elucidation of human xenobiotic products in tissue culture. It may be easily applied to other fields of research including drug metabolism, personalized medicine and systems biology and serves to better understand the relevance of in vitro experiments.",

Cells were grown in 6-well plates and incubated with 1 \u03bcM of unlabelled Deoxynivalenol (DON).

HT29 cells were cultivated in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Medium, and HepG2 cells were cultivated in RPMI 1640 Medium. Both basal media were supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal calf serum and 1% (v/v) of a solution containing penicillin G at 60 \u03bcg/ml and streptomycin at 100 \u03bcg/ml in the final medium. Cell culture media and supplements were purchased from GIBCO Invitrogen, Lonza Group Ltd., Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH, and Sarstedt AG &amp; Co. For cell cultivation and treatments humidified incubators at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2 were used. Cells were routinely tested for the absence of mycoplasma contamination and used for experiments at passages 10\u201314. Cells were seeded in 10 cm cell culture dishes (1,500,000 cells/Petri dish) from Sarstedt AG &amp; Co with TC-treated surface, grown for 72 h, and incubated for 3 h after adding fresh medium containing 10 \u03bcM of DON, consisting of 5 \u03bcM of 12C-DON and 5 \u03bcM 13C-DON. 3 individual biological experiments were performed. In addition, 2 control experiments were executed under identical incubation conditions as during the main experiment. For this purpose, medium without DON was added to the cells ( 1) and medium containing 5 \u03bcM of 12C-DON and 5 \u03bcM 13C-DON was added to Petri dishes without cells ( 2) (both in triplicates).</p>",

Cells were rinsed twice with 2.5 ml of prewarmed PBS. Subsequently, 0.7 ml of ice-cold quenching solution (ACN/MeOH/water; 40/40/20; v/v/v) was added. Cells were scraped off and transferred into reaction tubes, before 3 cycles of freeze\u2013thaw cycles and sonication were performed for cell lysis and metabolite extraction as follows: a) vortex for 30 s, b) liquid nitrogen for 1 min, c) thawing, and d) ultrasonication in ice bath for 10 min. To aid protein precipitation, the samples were incubated at \u221220 \u00b0C for 1 h after extraction, followed by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm and 4 \u00b0C. Supernatants were transferred into a new reaction tube and evaporated to dryness. Thereafter, the dried extracts were reconstituted in 240 \u03bcl of dilution solvent (MeOH/water; 10/90; v/v), sonicated for 10 min, and centrifuged for 15 min at 15,000 rpm and 4 \u00b0C.

Moreover, a spiking experiment was performed to estimate matrix effects during electrospray ionization. For this purpose, cell lysate samples and extracellular medium from HepG2 and HT29 incubations in which no DON was added to the medium (control experiment  1) were fortified in triplicate with native DON only.</p>",

The resolution (fwhm) was set to 60,000 (@ m/z 200) for full scan and 30,000 (@ m/z 200) for ddMS2 experiments. The automatic gain control (AGC) was set to 1 x 10^6 with a maximum injection time of 100 ms in full scan, whereas for the acquisition of ddMS2 2 x 10^5 with a maximum injection time of 60 ms was applied. The isolation window for the ddMS2 scans was 1 m/z. The 10 most abundant ions (top 10) were selected for MS2 analysis. A stepped normalized collision energy (NCE) at 20 and 50 eV was applied. A minimum AGC of 1 x 10^3 and an intensity threshold of 1.7 x 10^4 were chosen. The apex trigger was set to 2\u20135 s. Dynamic exclusion was activated for 8 s. For generating MS2 spectra of suspected DON conjugates, the settings were adapted as follows: scan range, m/z 100\u2013900; apex trigger, 3\u20138 s; dynamic exclusion, 10 s. Furthermore, an inclusion list consisting of all masses of interest was created (see Table S1 in the paper associated with this study). Specific m/z values for which MS2 spectra were already acquired in the initial run and the most abundant peaks in a solvent blank were suspended from MS2 triggering by an exclusion list. The injection volume was increased up to 20 \u03bcl in remeasurements in order to record spectra of higher quality for low abundance metabolites. The analysis of the samples obtained within the preliminary experiments was carried out according to previously published work<strong>[1]</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Warth B, Del Favero G, Wiesenberger G, Puntscher H, Woelflingseder L, Fruhmann P, Sarkanj B, Krska R, Schuhmacher R, Adam G, Marko D.

To find all detectable biotransformation products of DON\u2013known as well as putative novel ones\u2013the MetExtract II software (module TracExtract) was employed<strong>[2]</strong>. Briefly summarized, the software searched the LC-HRMS data for pairs of 2 chromatographic peaks from biotransformation products of DON that incorporated either the native or the uniformly 13C-labeled DON tracer. Such pairs showed complete chromatographic coelution as well as an m/z difference corresponding to the number of carbon atoms from the 13C-labeled DON. Any metabolite or chromatographic peak in the LC-HRMS data that was only present as a single form (i.e. native, non-13C-labeled form) was ignored by the software as it could be concluded that this peak was not derived from a biotransformation product of DON but rather an endogenous metabolite of the cells or any other unspecific compound (e.g. contamination, extraction artifact) present in the sample. Parameter settings for MetExtract II were as follows: module: TracExtract; intensity threshold (M and M\u2032): 1.104 cps; ratio of native and 13C-labeled tracer form: 0.75\u20131.25; number of carbon atoms searched for: 10\u201315 and 30 (for dimer ions); number of isotopologs checked: 2; maximum isotopolog deviation from expected relative abundance: 25%; XIC (ppm): 5; maximum mass deviation (ppm): 5; Pearson correlation threshold (minimum): 0.85.

Known metabolites included in the multi-component standard and other metabolites described in literature like the plant metabolites DONGSH, DON-cysteine and DON-cysteinylglycine<strong>[1-3]</strong> were annotated automatically by MetExtract II in case they were present. According to a previous study<strong>[4]</strong> other potential metabolites, namely the DON-sulfonates, were included in the analysis. The next step was the annotation of unknown biotransformation products. For ion pairs with a mass difference of 15,0503 between the 13C-labeled and the unlabeled compound an intact carbon scaffold of the DON-molecule was assumed. This applies to nearly all feature pairs not identified by authentic standards or reference MS2 spectra. Based on the known metabolites, thiols are conjugated to DON either via Michael addition at position C-10 or at position C-13, opening the epoxidemoiety. Another possible reaction is the conjugation of DON at ahydroxy group, mainly at position C-3 and C-15, by enzymatic reaction with activated co-substrates (UDP-glucuronic acid, acetyl-CoA or 3\u2032-phosphoadenosin-5\u2032-phosphosulfat) and elimination of water. With this knowledge the exact mass of molecules possibly conjugated to DON were calculated and databases like HMDB<strong>[5]</strong>, METLIN<strong>[6]</strong> and MassBank<strong>[7]</strong> were explored to see if matching molecules, potentially conjugated to DON could be found. In order to further characterize annotated conjugates, MS2 spectra were recorded and compared to reference spectra from mzCloud. As no reference spectra for the intact conjugates were available, reference spectra of the binding molecules were considered.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Kluger B, Bueschl C, Lemmens M, Michlmayr H, Malachova A, Koutnik A, Maloku I, Berthiller F, Adam G, Krska R, Schuhmacher R.
