                "description": "<p>Multidrug-resistant bacteria present a major threat to public health. Therefore, new drugs or approaches are urgently needed to manage and mitigate this threat. Here, we screen the molecular candidates that allow the survival of mice upon <em>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</em> infection by integrated proteomic and metabolomics analysis, where L-Alanine metabolism and phagocytosis are highly correlated. The role of L-Alanine on boosting mouse survival is further confirmed with <em>in vivo</em> bacterial challenge studies on bacteria including <em>V. parahaemolyticus</em>, <em>Escherichia coli</em>, <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> and <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em>. Functional studies demonstrate that exogenous L-Alanine promotes phagocytosis to these different species of multidrug-resistant pathogens. The underlying mechanism involves two events that are L-Alanine-dependently increased TLR4 expression and L-Alanine-enhanced TLR4 signaling via increasing the biosynthesis and secretion of fatty acids such as palmitate. Palmitate enhances the binding of LPS to TLR4 and thereby promotes TLR4 dimmer formation and endocytosis for the subsequent activation of PI3K/Akt and NF-\u03baB pathways and phagocytosis of bacteria. These results suggest that modulation of metabolic environment is a plausible approach for combating infection with multidrug-resistant bacteria.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>L-Alanine-treated macrophage metabolomics</strong> is reported in the current study <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS7986' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS7986</strong></a>.</p><p><strong>V. parahaemolyticus-infected</strong> <strong>spleen metabolomics </strong>is reported in <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS7996' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS7996</strong></a>.</p>",

We adopted the integrated metabolomic and proteomic approach to profile spleens after being infected with <em>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</em>. The crucial biomarker was identified through multivariate analysis. Metabolites that could potentiate phagocytosis was investigated in primary macrophage, macrophage cell lines and in mouse model. Using biochemical, immunological and cell biology approaches, we revealed the mechanism of metabolite action on phagocytosis.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ethics statement</strong></p><p>This study was conducted in accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health and maintained according to the standard protocols.

Subsequently, cells were incubated with 5 mM L-Alanine and 5mM [U-13C]-L-Alanine in serum-starved medium (DMEM/0.5% serum). Additionally, fresh media containing L-Alanine and [U-13C]-L-Alanine were exchanged 2 h before metabolite extraction for metabolic analysis. The quantity of the metabolite fraction was adjusted to the corresponding protein concentration. Metabolites were extracted from cells and cell medium, and then analyzed by GC-MS. Carbon-13 mass isotopomer analysis of metabolites was carried out using GC-MS according to the protocol described previously<strong>[1][2]</strong>. To remove all possible contributions of natural occurring isotopes within a molecular fragment (2H, 3H, 13C, 14C, 15N, 17O, etc.), isotopomer analysis of metabolites in cell and medium treated by some amount of non-isotope labeled L-Alanine were used as control. This procedure is essential to assess the specific contribution of exogenous 13C on a metabolite labeling. Mass isotopomer distribution was calculated by combining the peak area of each isotope by the sum of the peak area for all detected isotopes.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Peng B, Su YB, Li H, Han Y, Guo C, Tian YM, Peng XX.

Samples were centrifuged at 15,000 x g at 4 \u00b0C for 10 min to remove particulate matter. Metabolomic analyses were conducted in positive ion mode using a hybrid 7-T Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer (LTQ FT Ultra, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) with a chip-based direct infusion nanoelectrospray ion source (Triversa, Advion Biosciences, Ithaca, NY). Nanoelectrospray conditions comprised of a 200 nL/min flow rate, 0.3 psi backing pressure and +1.7 kV electrospray voltage controlled by ChipSoft software (version 8.1.0). Mass spectrometry conditions included an automatic gain control setting of 1 x 10^6 and a mass resolution of 100,000 (at 400 m/z). Analysis time was 2.25 min (per technical replicate), controlled using Xcalibur software (version 2.0, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Spectra were collected using the SIM stitching method, i.e. acquisition of seven overlapping selected ion monitoring (SIM) mass ranges between 70 and 590 Da in 100 Da windows, each with a 30 Da overlap with its neighbouring window<strong>[1]</strong>. This SIM stitching method has previously been shown to increase metabolome coverage compared to a traditional wide-scan approach, while providing high mass accuracy and a rapid sample throughput.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Weber RJ, Southam AD, Sommer U, Viant MR.

A retention time (RT) correction was performed for all the samples, and then the RT was used as reference against which the remaining spectra were queried and a file containing the abundance information for each metabolite in all the samples was assembled. Metabolites from the GC-MS spectra were identified by searching in National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) library used the NIST MS search 2.0. The resulting data matrix was normalized using the concentrations of added internal standards which were subsequently removed so that the data could be used for modeling consisted of extracted compound. The resulting normalized peak intensities form a single matrix with Rt-m/z pairs for each file in the dataset. To reduce between-sample variation we centered the imputed metabolic measures for each tissue sample on its median value and scaled it by its inter-quartile range (IQR)<strong>[2]</strong>. In the integration of proteomic and metabolomic data set, the z-score analysis scaled each protein or metabolite according to a reference distribution. The control samples were designated as the reference distribution. Thus, the mean and standard deviation of the control samples was determined for each metabolite or protein. Then each sample was centered by the control mean and scaled by the control standard deviation, per molecule. In this way, we can know how the molecule expressions deviate from the control state.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Jiang M, Gong QY, Lai SS, Cheng ZX, Chen ZG, Zheng J, Peng B.
