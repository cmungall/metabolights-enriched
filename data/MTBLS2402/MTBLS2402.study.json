                "description": "There is a current need to monitor human exposure to a large number of pesticides and other chemicals of emerging concern (CECs). This requires screening analysis with high confidence for these compounds and their metabolites in complex matrices, which is hampered by the fact that no reference standards are available for most metabolites. We address this challenge by a high-throughput workflow based on incubation of pesticides (or other CECs) with human liver S9, followed by solid-phase extraction, liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) analysis, and automated data processing to generate a database (retention time, precursor <i>m</i>/<i>z</i>, and MS<sup>2</sup> spectral library) for the annotation in human samples. The metabolite prioritization consists of statistical comparisons and mass defect and <i>m</i>/<i>z</i> range filtering to obtain a subset of probable phase I metabolites, for which molecular formulas and likely metabolic transformation are retrieved. We tested the workflow on 22 pesticides, for which we could determine 91 metabolite molecular formulas which are only partly covered by the literature and/or predicted by <i>in silico</i> metabolization. Our workflow allows for an efficient generation of metabolite reference information, which can be used directly for annotating LC-HRMS data from human samples. A full structure elucidation of individual metabolites can be limited to those being actually present in human samples.",

The selection consisted of pesticides from a broad range of classes, including the herbicide classes phenoxyacetic acids (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid), pyridines (picolinafen), triazines (atrazine, terbuthylazine, and terbutryn), chloroacetanilides (metolachlor and metazachlor), chloroacetamides (dimethenamid), dinitroanilines (pendimethalin), diphenylethers (bifenox), triazinones (metamitron), oxyacetanilides (flufenacet), carboxamides (diflufenican), and phenylurea derivatives (chlorotoluron and isoproturon); the fungicide classes morpholines (fenpropimorph) and strobilurins (azoxystrobin); and the insecticide classes neonicotinoides (imidacloprid), organophosphates (chlorpyrifos-ethyl and dimethoate), phenylpyrazoles (fipronil), and pyrethroids (cypermethrin). All standards were at least of 97% purity; the vendors are given in <strong>Table S1 </strong>in the paper associated with this study.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Human Liver S9 Incubation</strong></p><p>We adapted the method for generating phase I metabolites from previous studies in drug discovery<strong>[1]</strong> and kinetic profiling of metabolic reactions.<strong>[2]</strong> The experiment was performed in 96-well plates, 1 plate containing 3 replicates of the incubation of<strong> 22 pesticides</strong>, 6 negative <strong>control replicates (</strong>i.e., S9 and the coenzyme without the addition of a pesticide), aqueous solutions of each <strong>pesticide standard</strong>, and 2 sample <strong>blanks </strong>(for setup, see the Figure S1 in the paper associated with this study). A working solution with a concentration of 1 mg/mL in methanol was prepared for each pesticide. On each well of the plate representing an incubation or a standard control, 2.1 \u03bcL of each standard working solution were spiked into 200 \u03bcL of 0.05 M TRIS buffer (pH 7.4). Subsequently, 20 \u03bcL of the pooled <strong>human liver S9 </strong>mix (Sekisui Xenotech Xtreme, LLC, Kansas City, USA; containing 200 pooled human liver S9 fractions of mixed gender at a concentration of 20 mg/mL) were added to the wells. The well plate was placed into an incubator (neoLab neoMix 7- 0921, Heidelberg, Germany) and incubated for 5 min, after which 15 \u03bcL of 20 mM reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) solution was added. The incubation was performed for 3 h at 37.5\u00b0C under constant shaking and stopped by the addition of ice-cold methanol (1:1 incubation volume).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Hu M, M\u00fcller E, Schymanski EL, Ruttkies C, Schulze T, Brack W, Krauss M.

A polar embedded C18 column (Synergi Polar-RP, 100 mm \u00d7 3 mm, \u00d72.5 \u03bcm, 100 \u00c5 particle size, Phenomenex) held at a temperature of 40 \u00b0C and a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min was used. A ternary gradient of water, methanol, acetonitrile, and a mixture of isopropanol and acetone (50:50) for the final rinsing step was used. The full gradient program can be found in Figure S2. All samples were injected with a volume of 50 \u03bcL. For generating a complete spectral library of all metabolic features, a second measurement of one replicate of each pesticide was performed, applying an inclusion list for dd-MS2 acquisition. For better chromatographic separation of isomeric metabolites, we used a BEH C18 column (1.7 \u03bcm 2.1 mm \u00d7 100 mm, Waters) at 50\u00b0C and a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min. We applied a water/methanol gradient with 100/0 at 0 min, 0/100 at 15 min, 0/100 at 21 min, 100/0 at 22 min, and100/0 at 30 min. For positive mode analysis, we added 0.1% formic acid and 0.2% of 1 M ammonium formate, and for negative mode, we added 1% of 1 M ammonium carbonate to the eluents.</p>",

Full scan analysis was performed with a nominal resolving power of 70,000 (at m/z 200) in the profile mode combined with a dd-MS2 acquisition (nominal resolving power of 35,000) of the 3 most intense ions of each scan, including a dynamic exclusion of 6 s. The isolation window was set to 1.0 m/z, and stepped normalized collision energies of 30 and 55 were used. Further MS2 information was generated by a second measurement with an inclusion list containing all ions of interest for which no MS2 spectra had been acquired in the previous run. Here, two separate experiments with the collision energies of 30 and 55 were used. For quality assurance and control of the LC\u2212HRMS analyses, see <strong>Section S3 </strong>in the paper associated with this study. For testing the detection rate of a spectral library match with samples containing human matrices, reference standards of five known human metabolites, also observed in the S9 approach (carboxy-fenpropimorph, imidacloprid-urea, 2-hydroxy-atrazine, 2-hydroxy-terbuthylazine, and desethyl-terbuthylazine) were spiked into a pooled human urine sample at 10 and 100 ng/mL. The sample was analyzed with the same method as the one used for the S9 incubation.</p>",
