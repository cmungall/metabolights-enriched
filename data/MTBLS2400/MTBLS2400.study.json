                "description": "<p><strong>BACKGROUND: </strong>Therapeutic management of epilepsy remains a challenge, since optimal systemic antiseizure medication (ASM) concentrations do not always correlate with improved clinical outcome and minimal side effects. We tested the feasibility of non-invasive real-time breath metabolomics as an extension of traditional therapeutic drug monitoring for patient-stratification by simultaneously monitoring drug-related and drug-modulated metabolites.</p><p><strong>METHODS: </strong>This proof-of-principle observational study involved 93 breath measurements of 54 paediatric patients monitored over a period of 2.5 years, along with an adults\u2019 cohort of 37 patients measured in two different hospitals. Exhaled breath metabolome of epileptic patients was measured in real-time using secondary electrospray ionization-high resolution mass spectrometry (SESI-HRMS).</p><p><strong>RESULTS: </strong>We show that systemic ASM concentrations could be predicted by the breath test. Total and free valproic acid (VPA; an ASM) is predicted with concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) of 0.63 and 0.66, respectively. We also find i) high between- and within-subject heterogeneity in VPA metabolism; ii) several amino acid metabolic pathways are significantly enriched (p &lt; 0.01) in patients suffering from side effects and iii) tyrosine metabolism is significantly enriched (p &lt; 0.001), with downregulated pathway compounds in non-responders.</p><p><strong>CONCLUSIONS: </strong>These results show that real-time breath analysis of epileptic patients provides reliable estimations of systemic drug concentrations along with risk estimates for drug response and side effects.</p>",

Furthermore, we also used real-time breath data of 41 adult epileptic patients (mean \u00b1 SD age, 51.6 \u00b1 17.1 years; 29 male and 12 females, see<strong> Supplementary Data 1 </strong>in the paper associated with this study) from the University Hospital Zurich (USZ) to predict blood concentrations of total and free VPA. All subjects were under steady-state of their ASMs at the time of measurements.</p><p><br></p><p>In paediatric dataset (from UKBB) out of 123 attempted breath measurements (from 66 patients), 30 failed (see <strong>Supplementary Data 1</strong> in the paper associated with this study), whereas in adult dataset (from USZ) out of 41 attempted measurements (from 41 patients; in USZ there were no multiple visits from same patient during study duration), 4 failed (see <strong>Supplementary Data 1</strong> in the paper associated with this study). The reasons being either: i) patients suffered from severe neurological impairment, preventing them to understand the instructions of the exhalation manoeuvre, or that the side effects would not allow them to perform the breath test (hence they are unable), ii) some technical issue with instrument during patient visit, or iii) in rare cases clinical laboratories could not return blood concentration of (any) ASMs (see<strong> Supplementary Fig. 1 </strong>in the paper associated with this study). This means our final dataset used in the study contained 93 paediatric measurements (from 54 subjects) and 37 adult measurements (from 37 subjects).</p><p><br></p><p>Paediatric measurements/patients were further annotated as follows, no such annotations were made for adult dataset as it was only used to predict blood concentrations of total and free VPA.</p><p>Following the etiologic classification of epilepsy by the international league against epilepsy (ILAE)<strong>[1] </strong>paediatric patients were divided into three groups. Group 1 consisted of patients with <strong>epilepsies of structural origin</strong>, group 2 consisted of patients suffering from <strong>genetic epilepsies</strong>, as well as epilepsies of unknown origin and, finally, in order to differentiate them from genetic epileptic encephalopathies, group 3 consisted of <strong>developmental and epileptic encephalopathies</strong> was created. None of the enrolled paediatric patients were suffering from epilepsies of metabolic, immune or infectious origin.</p><p><br></p><p>In order to assess the clinical outcome of ASMs, we further classified each data point for three categories: <strong>side effects</strong>, <strong>response to medication and electroencephalography </strong>(EEG). Patients were labelled for each of these categories as <strong>classes I</strong>,<strong> II </strong>or<strong> III</strong> (see <strong>Supplementary Table 1 </strong>in the paper associated with this study for classes definitions). Side effects questionnaire PESQ<strong>[2]</strong> (see <strong>Supplementary Table 2</strong> in the paper associated with this study) was used to facilitate the side effect comparison for epilepsies of different origins.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class='ql-align-justify'>Subjects performed prolonged exhalations directly into SESI-HRMS system following <strong>blood </strong>draw for TDM (median = 21.2 min; IQR = 38.6 min). <strong>Fig. 1a </strong>in the paper associated with this study shows a representation of a child exhaling into the device (see <strong>Supplementary Fig. 2</strong> for bigger image in the paper associated with this study).

This resulted in a data matrix of 75 \u00d7 3,252 (measurements \u00d7 mass spectral features; see <strong>Fig. 1d </strong>in the paper associated with this study). This data matrix was then used to develop models i) to predict drug concentrations (see<strong> Fig. 1e</strong> in the paper associated with this study) and ii) to predict side effect and drug-response scores (see<strong> Fig. 1f </strong>in the paper associated with this study).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For VPA concentration prediction (see <strong>Fig.1e</strong> in the paper associated with this study), First, the full training-set was reduced to 240 features, which were present in at least 80% of the measurements whereby the patients were receiving VPA (i.e. drug-related features). Later features in the training-set were further reduced to only 11 VPA-related features (see<strong> Supplementary Table 4 </strong>in the paper associated with this study). Afterwards, extracted ion chromatograms (XICs) for these 11 features were directly extracted from all paediatric and adult measurements using <strong>inhouse C  console app</strong> based on <strong>RawFileReader</strong> (<strong>version 5.0.0.38</strong>) an open source .Net assembly from Thermo Fisher Scientific. These XICs were then used to generate nAUC and three different matrices (UKBB training-set, UKBB test-set, and USZ test-set). The ComBat function from <strong>sva </strong>(<strong>version 3.34.0</strong>)<strong>[2] </strong>was then use to remove known batch effect from these matrices (see <strong>Supplementary Fig. 4</strong> and <strong>Supplementary Data 2</strong> in the paper associated with this study). This reduced training-set was finally used to screen for the best regression model (see <strong>Supplementary Fig. 5</strong> and <strong>6 </strong>in the paper associated with this study). Finally, we found Gaussian process regression using exponential kernel (i.e. eGPR) to be best performing on the training-set and hence it was used on independent test-set containing paediatric and adult patients for final predictions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In order to gain further insights into the rest of the metabolic signature captured in breath (see <strong>Fig. 1f </strong>in the paper associated with this study), firstly, the full training-set was reduced to 1005 features present in at least 50% of total measurements and with a CV greater than 30% (i.e. drug-regulated features). Later two sample t-test was performed followed by false discovery rate (see <strong>Supplementary Fig. 7</strong> in the paper associated with this study). Afterwards, <strong>MetaboAnalystR </strong>(<strong>version 2.0.4</strong>)<strong>[3] </strong>was used to add more biological insights into differentially abundant ions, by translating ions to metabolic pathways. The prediction of side effects vs no side effects and non-responders vs responders in training-set was conducted using significant metabolites identified by the enrichment analysis using first principle-component (PC1) score. On this score, using only training-set data, a cut-off was assigned (based on Youden's index) to separate predicted classes (see <strong>Supplementary Fig. 8</strong> in the paper associated with this study). Later, we projected UKBB test-set data on the training-set PC1 score to complete this analysis.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1] </strong>Wong JW, Durante C, Cartwright HM.

The SESI ion source was fed with 0.1% ammonium formate in water solution, flowing (solution driving pressure 1.3 bar) through a 20 \u00b5m ID non-coated TaperTip silica capillary emitter (New Objective, USA) to generate electrospray. The settings of the SESI source were as follows: sheath gas flow rate 60, auxiliary gas flow rate 2, spray voltage 3.5 kV, capillary temperature 275 \u00b0C, and S-lens RF level 55.0. Under these conditions, the nano-electrospray currents were typically in the order of 130 nA. SESI temperatures were set at 130 \u00b0C for the sampling line and 90 \u00b0C for the ion source core.&nbsp;</p>",
