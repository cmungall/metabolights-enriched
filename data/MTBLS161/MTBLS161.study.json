                "description": "Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a debilitating long-term multisystem disorder with a central and inexplicably persistent fatigue symptom that is unable to be relieved by rest. Energy metabolism and oxidative stress have been recent focal points of ME/CFS research and in this study we were able to elucidate metabolic pathways that were indicative of their dysfunction. Blood and urine samples were collected from 34 females with ME/CFS (34.9 \u00b1 1.8 SE years old) and 25 non-ME/CFS female participants (33.0 \u00b1 1.6 SE years old). All samples underwent metabolic profiling via 1D 1H Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and quantitated metabolites were assessed for significance. Blood glucose was elevated while blood lactate, urine pyruvate, and urine alanine were reduced indicating an inhibition of glycolysis that may potentially reduce the provision of adequate acetyl-CoA for the citric acid cycle. We propose that amino acids are being increasingly used to provide an adequate carbohydrate source for the citric acid cycle. We suggest that this is via glutamate forming 2-oxoglutarate through an enzyme that deaminates it and subsequently elevates blood aspartate. Dysfunctional energy metabolism appears to have impacted creatinine and its elevation in urine suggests that it may be used as an alternative for anaerobic ATP production within muscle. A decrease in blood hypoxanthine and an increase in urine allantoin further suggest the elevation of reactive oxygen species in ME/CFS patients. These findings bring new information to the research of energy metabolism, chronic immune activation and oxidative stress issues within ME/CFS.",

Diagnosis of ME/CFS was made on the nature of the clinical history, in association with the Canadian criteria, having excluded other illnesses. The same clinician also verified that subjects within the non-ME/CFS cohort were not suffering from ME/CFS or any other illness. All subjects were asked to list their current medications and oral supplements. None of the subjects were related to one another nor were they ever living together and none of the subjects were obese or nicotine dependent.\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Carruthers, B. M. (2007).

All 72 blood samples were prepared simultaneously and all 72 urine samples were prepared simultaneously.  A 250 \u00b5l sample of each serum/urine sample was added to 250 \u00b5l ice-cold deuterated chloroform and 250 \u00b5l ice-cold deuterated methanol and mixed by vortexing before being left to sit on ice for 15 minutes.  Samples were then centrifuged (16,100 x g) at 4 \u00baC for 10 minutes to produce a biphasic mixture with a hydrophilic phase of water/deuterated methanol and lipophilic phase of deuterated chloroform. A 297 \u00b5l sample of the top hydrophilic layer was added to an equal volume of 200 mM sodium phosphate in deuterium oxide (pH 7) and 66 \u00b5l of deuterium oxide containing 5 mM DSS and 0.2% (w/v) sodium azide to make a total volume of 660 \u00b5l.  The sample was then mixed by vortex, centrifuged for 1 min at 13,000 rpm and 550 \u00b5l of supernatant was transferred to a 7-inch 5-mm 507-grade NMR tube for NMR analysis.\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Sheedy, J.

Metabolite identities were confirmed using 2D TOCSY experiments with TOPSPIN 1.3 software. Twenty-nine metabolites per blood serum sample and thirty metabolites per urine sample were identified.",
