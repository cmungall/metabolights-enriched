                "description": "Diatoms and copepods are main actors in marine food webs. The prey-predator interactions between them affect bloom dynamics, shape marine ecosystems and impact the energy transfer to higher trophic levels. Recently it has been demonstrated that the presence of grazers may affect the diatom prey beyond the direct effect of grazing. Here, we investigated the response of the chain-forming centric diatom Skeletonema marinoi to grazer cues, including changes in morphology, gene expression and metabolic profile. S. marinoi cells were incubated with Calanus finmarchicus or with Centropages typicus and in both cases responded by reducing the chain length, whereas changes in gene expression indicated an activation of stress response, changes in the lipid and nitrogen metabolism, in cell cycle regulation and in frustule formation. Transcripts linked to G protein-coupled receptors and to nitric oxide synthesis were differentially expressed suggesting involvement of these signalling transduction pathways in the response. Downregulation of a lipoxygenase in the transcriptomic data and of its products in the metabolomic data also indicate an involvement of oxylipins. Our data contribute to a better understanding of the gene function in diatoms, providing information on the nature of genes implicated in the interaction with grazers, a crucial process in marine ecosystems.",

The algorithm is divided into 2 parts and first groups of co-variant ions are located, each group representing a unique feature. The features are defined as time-aligned ions (i.e. isotopes, adducts and/or dimers) summarized to the calculated neutral mass, possess an abundance and a retention time (RT), and are treated as compounds. We allowed for \u2013H and CH3COO adducts, and a neutral loss of H2O. Compounds with absolute peak heights of 20000 or higher and occurring in at least 3 of 5 samples within at least 1 treatment were selected for compound alignment (RT window = 0.3 min, mass tolerance = 5 ppm + 2 mD). The second part of the algorithm creates a composite list of ions for the aligned compounds and performs a recursive, targeted analysis of raw data. This step reduces false-positive and false-negative detection rates generated in the first untargeted feature extraction. The settings for adduct ions, neutral mass, and aggregates (i.e. dimers) were the same as for the first extraction. The chromatograms of the resulted aligned compounds were visually inspected in MH Profinder and reintegrated when needed (e.g. double peaks were occasionally aligned wrongly). As a final filter only compounds occurring in all samples within at least 1 treatment were considered and the final peak list was exported as a text file for statistical analysis. For calculations of elemental compositions of specific metabolites, the molecular formula generator (MFG) algorithm included in the Agilent MassHunter Workstation software was used. MFG uses a wide range of MS information including accurate mass measurements, isotope abundances, and spacing between isotope peaks to produce a list of candidate molecular formulas that are ranked according to their relative probabilities. Data was normalised to biovolume from coultercounts before multivariate analysis to avoid confounding effects of grazing.",

The metabolic response of Skeletonema to copepod grazing was analysed with multivariate data analysis, using the software SIMCA (version 13.0.0.0, Umetrics, Sweden). Principal component analysis was used to generate an overview and to analyse for systematic differences in metabolite content between treatments.",
