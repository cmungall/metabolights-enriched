                "description": "<p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> Secondary metabolism contributes to the adaptation of a plant to its environment. In wine grapes, fruit secondary metabolism largely determines wine quality. Climate change is predicted to exacerbate drought events in several viticultural areas, potentially affecting the wine quality. In red grapes, water deficit modulates flavonoid accumulation, leading to major quantitative and compositional changes in the profile of the anthocyanin pigments; in white grapes, the effect of water deficit on secondary metabolism is still largely unknown.</p><p><strong>RESULTS:</strong> In this study we investigated the impact of water deficit on the secondary metabolism of white grapes using a large scale metabolite and transcript profiling approach in a season characterized by prolonged drought. Irrigated grapevines were compared to non-irrigated grapevines that suffered from water deficit from early stages of berry development to harvest. A large effect of water deficit on fruit secondary metabolism was observed. Increased concentrations of phenylpropanoids, monoterpenes, and tocopherols were detected, while carotenoid and flavonoid accumulations were differentially modulated by water deficit according to the berry developmental stage. The RNA-sequencing analysis carried out on berries collected at three developmental stages-before, at the onset, and at late ripening-indicated that water deficit affected the expression of 4,889 genes. The Gene Ontology category secondary metabolic process was overrepresented within up-regulated genes at all the stages of fruit development considered, and within down-regulated genes before ripening. 18 phenylpropanoid, 16 flavonoid, 9 carotenoid, and 16 terpenoid structural genes were modulated by water deficit, indicating the transcriptional regulation of these metabolic pathways in fruit exposed to water deficit. An integrated network and promoter analyses identified a transcriptional regulatory module that encompasses terpenoid genes, transcription factors, and enriched drought-responsive elements in the promoter regions of those genes as part of the grapes response to drought.</p><p><strong>CONCLUSION:</strong> Our study reveals that grapevine berries respond to drought by modulating several secondary metabolic pathways, and particularly, by stimulating the production of phenylpropanoids, the carotenoid zeaxanthin, and of volatile organic compounds such as monoterpenes, with potential effects on grape and wine antioxidant potential, composition, and sensory features.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>UPLC-MS/MS assay of Phenolics</strong> is reported in the current study <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS897' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS897</strong></a>.</p><p><strong>SPME-GC-MS assay of Volatile organic compounds</strong> is reported in <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS892' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS892</strong></a>.</p><p><strong>UPLC-DAD assay of Carotenoids</strong> is reported in <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS889' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS889</strong></a>.</p>",

Spectra components and elution profiles were previously determined<strong>[1]</strong>. Briefly, a flow rate of 0.21 ml/min and an injection volume of 3 \u00b5l were adopted. The mobile phases consisted of methanol (A) and tert-methyl butyl ether (B), both containing 5% of a mixture of water/methanol (20/80 by volume) and 0.2% (w/v) ammonium acetate. The gradient elution consisted of 100% A isocratically for 6 min, a step to 82.5% A at 7 min, maintained isocratically for 5 min, followed by a linear gradient to 32.5% A by 30 min, these conditions were maintained for 14 min. A conditioning phase (48\u201360 min) was then used to return the column the initial concentration of A. The DAD signal was acquired from 200 to 600 nm (step 1.2 nm) with a slit width of 1 nm, at a frequency of 2.5 Hz.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Wehrens R, Carvalho E, Masuero D, de Juan A, Martens S.

The field experiment was conducted in accordance with local legislation and no specific permission was required for the study.</p><p><br></p><p>Climatological data were recorded during the experiment by an automated weather station located 100 m from the experimental site. Monthly mean temperatures and amount of rainfalls measured in 2012, as well as the averages of the 2000\u20132012 period, are shown in <strong>Table S1</strong> in the paper associated with this study. 7 year old Tocai Friulano (also known as Sauvignon vert and Sauvignonasse in Chile and France, respectively) grapevines grafted onto SO4 were planted at 2.5 m x 1.0 m spacing in north\u2013south oriented rows, and trained to a cane-pruned 'Guyot' system. 2 irrigation treatments were established. <strong>Control (C)</strong> vines were irrigated in order to maintain midday stem water potential (\u03c8Stem) above \u22120.8 MPa. <strong>Deficit irrigated (D)</strong> vines were not irrigated unless the \u03c8Stem was measured lower than \u22121.5 MPa. Plant water status was monitored weekly by measuring \u03c8Stem using a Scholander pressure chamber<strong>[1]</strong>. Irrigation was supplied when rainfall in the preceding week was below 100% ETc. or \u03c8Stem was measured lower than \u22121.5 MPa, as discussed above. A surface drip irrigation system with emitters (0.5 m x 2.5 m) set to an 8 l/h application rate was used. At the maximum rate, water was supplied at approximately 40 l per vine per week. Due to a prolonged drought, irrigation (20 l per vine) was applied to D vines at 67, 70, 76 days after anthesis (DAA) in order to mitigate the extreme water deficit. Each irrigation treatment was replicated on 4 plots of 6 vines each, arranged in a completely randomized design. No effect of the irrigation treatments was observed on the number of shoots and clusters per vine.</p><p><br></p><p>Berry samplings were carried out at 27, 41, 54, 68, 82, and 93 DAA. A set of 40 berries were carefully trimmed off the cluster at the pedicel with a pair of scissors, quickly brought to the laboratory, and immediately frozen at \u221280 \u00b0C for metabolite analysis. Before metabolite extractions, pedicel was removed with a scalpel and berries were ground to a fine powder under liquid nitrogen using an analytical mill (IKA-Werke GMbH &amp; CO). 1 quality control (QC) sample was prepared by pooling an aliquot of all the samples and was used for QC runs in the metabolite analysis.</p><p><br></p><p>Grapes were harvested for commercial wine production at 93 DAA, when titratable acidity reached approximately 5 mg/l in both treatments; yield per vine, number of clusters per vine, and cluster weight were recorded.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Herrera JC, Bucchetti B, Sabbatini P, Comuzzo P, Zulini L, Vecchione A, et al.
