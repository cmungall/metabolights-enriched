                "description": "<p>Microalgae are important primary producers and form the basis for the marine food web. As global climate changes, so do salinity levels that algae are exposed to. A metabolic response of algal cells partly alleviates the resulting osmotic stress. Some metabolites involved in the response are well studied, but the full metabolic implications of adaptation remain unclear. Improved analytical methodology provides an opportunity for additional insight. We can now follow responses to stress in major parts of the metabolome and derive comprehensive charts of the resulting metabolic re-wiring. In this study, we subjected three species of diatoms to high salinity conditions and compared their metabolome to controls in an untargeted manner. The three well-investigated species with sequenced genomes <em>Phaeodactylum tricornutum</em>, <em>Thalassiosira pseudonana</em> and <em>Skeletonema marinoi</em> were selected for our survey. The microalgae react to salinity stress with common adaptations in the metabolome by amino acid up-regulation, production of saccharides and inositols. But also species-specific dysregulation of metabolites is common. Several metabolites previously not connected with osmotic stress reactions are identified, including 4-hydroxyproline, pipecolinic acid, myo-inositol, threonic acid and acylcarnitines. This expands our knowledge about osmoadaptation and calls for further functional characterization of metabolites and pathways in algal stress physiology.</p>",

                        "description": "<p><strong>GC-MS</strong></p><p>GC-MS measurements were performed on a Q-Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer connected to a Trace 1310 Gas Chromatograph with a TriPlus RSH Autosampler (Thermo Scientific, Bremen, Germany). The gas chromatograph was equipped with a Zebron ZB-SemiVolatiles column (30 m x 0.25 mm x 0.25 \u03bcm, Phenomenex, USA). Helium was used as a carrier gas with a flow rate of 1 mL/min.</p><p><br></p><p>Due to the high intensity of the proline peak at the beginning of the GC chromatogram, split ratios had to be high enough to not overload column and detector. However, detection of low concentrated metabolites was limited at those split ratios. To circumvent this, all samples were injected twice and measured with 2 different methods. The first method ('Proline method') was run at a sufficiently high split rate to detect proline without overloading the system and MS-acquisition was terminated after elution of proline. The second method ('After proline method') was run with a lower split ratio, the same temperature gradient, but acquisition started after the elution of proline. For data analysis, preprocessed data for both measurements were combined, with data up to retention time of proline taken from the first measurement and data after retention time of proline taken from the second one.</p><p><br></p><p>Altogether 2 different programs were applied for measurement of the samples, program 1 was used in the 'Proline method': The initial temperature 80 \u00b0C was maintained for 2 min, rose to 120 \u00b0C at a rate of 20 \u00b0C/min, maintained for 1 min, rose to 135 \u00b0C at a rate of 5 \u00b0C/min, rose to 320 \u00b0C at a rate of 125 \u00b0C/min and maintained for 7 min. Program 2 was used for 'After proline method' and 'QC method': The initial temperature 80 \u00b0C was maintained for 2 min, rose to 120 \u00b0C at a rate of 20 \u00b0C/min, maintained for 1 min, rose to 250 \u00b0C at a rate of 5 \u00b0C/min, rose to 320 \u00b0C at a rate of 10 \u00b0C/min and maintained for 2 min. The difference between the two temperature programs is due to the fact that the program for 'Proline method' is used to acquire data only until RT of proline, and is then followed by a post-run bakeout. Method 'After proline method' and 'QC method' follow the same temperature gradient since data acquisition for 'QC method' continues beyond RT of proline and for 'After proline method' starts at this point, temperature gradients for both methods continue until 40 min.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>LC-MS</strong></p><p>Samples for LC-MS analysis were measured with a Dionex Ultimate 3000 system coupled to a Q-Exactive Plus Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, Bremen, Germany). The duration of the method was 14.5 min with an MS runtime from 0.5 to 9.0 min. Separation of the samples was performed on a SeQuant ZIC-HILIC column (5 \u00b5m, 200 \u00c5, 150 x 2.1 mm, Merck, Germany), equipped with SeQuant ZIC-HILIC guard column (20 x 2.1 mm, Merck, Germany). Eluent A consisted of water with 2% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid, eluent B of 90% acetonitrile with 10% water and 1 mmol/L ammonium acetate. The flow rate was set to 0.6 mL/min, the gradient started with 85% solvent B which was held for 4.0 min, gradient to 0% of solvent B (4.0-5.0 min), hold 0% B (5.0-9.0 min), gradient to 100% B (9.0-10.0 min), hold 100% B (10.0-12.0 min), gradient to 85% B (12.0-12.5 min), hold 85% B (12.5-14.5 min).</p>",

For the chemical ionization (CI) mode temperature of the ion source was 180 \u00b0C, methane was used as an ionization gas with a flow rate of 1.5 mL/min. The injected volume of samples was 1 \u00b5L, for EI mode split ratio varied (Table S1 in the paper associated with this study), for CI mode split was changed to splitless mode. Data were recorded in full scan profile mode across a mass range from 50 to 600 m/z in EI mode. Full scan profile mode with a mass range from 80 to 1000 m/z was used for the CI mode, the ionization energy was 70 eV.</p><p><br></p><p>All samples were injected twice and measured with 2 different methods. The first method ('Proline method') was run at a sufficiently high split rate to detect proline without overloading the system. The second method ('After proline method') was run with a lower split ratio, the same temperature gradient, but acquisition starting after the elution of the proline peak. Retention time of proline was 7.6 min for P. tricornutum samples and 7.9 min for T. pseudonana and S. marinoi samples (RT of proline). QC samples were used to trace reproducibility of metabolite response over the whole measurement sequence and to establish normalized retention times via retention time standards. For this reason, QC samples were measured in a single run at a fixed split ratio ('QC method'). The third method was applied to measure entire sample. The first and second methods were applied for single samples. QC samples with retention time standards in both EI and CI modes were measured in a single run.</p><p><br></p><p>The order of the samples\u2019 measurements was randomized within samples from one extraction timepoint. Pooled QC samples were measured at the beginning and every 5 samples for the purpose of signal drift correction. For samples measured twice, the 'After proline method' was run before the 'Proline method'.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>LC-MS</strong></p><p>MS and MS/MS measurements were conducted within the scan range from 80 to 1200 m/z with resolution 70,000. MS measurements were performed in positive and negative modes (polarity switching) with resolution 70,000. MS/MS measurements were performed separately for positive and negative modes using parallel reaction monitoring, 3-stepped normalized collision energy 15, 30 and 45 were applied.</p><p><br></p><p>MS1 measurements were conducted with the following settings: automatic gain control target 3E6, the maximum ion injection time 200 ms, and scan range from 80 to 1200 m/z. Single samples and QC samples for relative standard deviation correction were measured simultaneously with positive and negative modes with resolution 70,000. Moreover, QC samples were measured with higher resolution 280,000, in positive and negative mode separately.</p><p><br></p><p>The order of measurement for samples from 2 timepoints was randomized, QC samples for relative standard deviation correction were measured every 5 samples for signal drift correction.</p><p><br></p><p>MS2 measurements were performed for compounds detected in the MS1 data with Compound Discoverer version 3.1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) applying standard workflow (Untargeted Metabolomics with Statistics Detect Unknowns with ID Using Online Databases and mzLogic) with default settings.
