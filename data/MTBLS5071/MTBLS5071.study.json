                "description": "<p>Alcohol dependence is a chronic, relapsing encephalopathy characterized by compulsive craving for alcohol, loss of control over alcohol use, and the presence of negative emotions and physical discomfort when alcohol is unavailable. Harmful use of alcohol is one of the greatest risk factors for death, illness and disability. Rho kinase inhibitors have neuroprotective effects. This study used metabonomics analysis to assess untreated astrocytes, astrocytes exposed to 75 mmol/L of alcohol, and astrocytes exposed to 75 mmol/L of alcohol and treated with 15 \u00b5g/mL fasudil for 24 h. One of the clearest differences between the alcohol-exposed and fasudil-treated alcohol-exposed groups was the abundance of lipids and lipid-like molecules, although glycerophospholipid metabolism was comparable in both groups. Our findings show that fasudil may alleviate alcohol-induced astrocyte damage by modifying lipid metabolism, providing a new approach for preventing and treating alcohol dependence.</p>",

The sample was then cooled at -20 \u00b0C for 0.5 h, followed by centrifugation at 4 \u00b0C for 15 min at 125 x g. Next, the supernatant was discarded, the pellet was blown dry with nitrogen, and 120 \u00b5L of the extraction solution prepared above was added and mixed thoroughly to redissolve the pellet. Subsequently, another round of low-temperature ultrasonic extraction and centrifugation was performed at 4 \u00b0C for 5 min at 125 x g. The resulting supernatants were then moved to fresh tubes for later use. To ensure the stability and repeatability of the experiment, a quality control sample was prepared by combining equal volumes of all samples and mixing thoroughly.</p>",
