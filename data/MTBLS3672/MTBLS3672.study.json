                "description": "<p>Temperature, water and light are 3 abiotic stress factors that have major influences on plant growth, development and reproduction. Plants can be primed by a prior mild stress to enhance their resistance to future stress. We used an untargeted metabolomics approach to examine <em>Arabidopsis thaliana</em> 11-day-old seedling\u2019s abiotic stress responses including heat (with and without priming), cold (with and without priming), water-deficit and high-light before and after a 2-day recovery period. Analysis of the physiological phenotypes showed that seedlings with stress treatment resulted in a reduction in fresh weight, hypocotyl and root length but remained viable. Several stress responsive metabolites were identified, confirmed with reference standards, quantified and clustered. We identified shared and specific stress signatures for cold, heat, water-deficit and high-light treatments. Central metabolism including amino acid metabolism, sugar metabolism, glycolysis, TCA cycle, GABA shunt, glutathione metabolism, purine metabolism and urea cycle were found to undergo changes that are fundamentally different, although some shared commonalities in response to different treatments. Large increases in cysteine abundance and decreases in reduced glutathione were observed following multiple stress treatments highlighting the importance of oxidative stress as a general phenomenon in abiotic stress. Large fold increases in low-turnover amino acids and maltose demonstrate the critical role of protein and starch autolysis in early abiotic stress responses.</p>",

Seedlings were germinated on 1/2 x Murashige and Skoog media made from Murashige and Skoog salts (PhytoTechnology Laboratories, M524 Murashige and Skoog Basal Salt Mixture, 4.33\u2009g/L for 1 x MS) with 1.5% agar. Plants were grown prior to stress, during recovery, and as unstressed controls, vertically, at 22\u2009\u00b0C under a 16 h light/8 h dark photoperiod, with \u223c80\u2009\u03bcmol/m^2/s illumination from cool-white fluorescent tube lights (control conditions). And 11-day-old seedlings were treated with abiotic stress conditions including <strong>basal cold</strong> (<strong>BC</strong>): 4 \u00b0C for 3 h; <strong>cold pretreatment</strong> (<strong>CP</strong>): 4 \u00b0C for 3 h, 22 \u00b0C for 1 h, then -15 \u00b0C for 1 h; <strong>basal heat</strong> (<strong>BH</strong>): 45 \u00b0C for 5 h; <strong>heat pretreatment</strong> (<strong>HP</strong>): 38 \u00b0C for 1.5 h, 22 \u00b0C for 2 h, then 45 \u00b0C for 5 h; <strong>water deficit</strong> (<strong>WD</strong>) / <strong>drought</strong>: remove seedling grown on nylon membrane from medium and desiccate in air for 2 h; <strong>high light</strong> (<strong>HL</strong>): 902 \u03bcmol/m^2/s metal halide light for 1 h (<strong>Table 1</strong> in the paper associated with this study). After the stress treatments, plants were removed back to the \u2018control conditions\u2019 for 2 days. Whole seedlings were harvested for the <strong>stress</strong> and <strong>recovery</strong> groups, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80\u2009\u00b0C. Experiments were performed using 3 biological replicates, and each replicate consisted of 25 seedlings grown together on a single plate and pooled. The recovery group for water-deficit stress was obtained by moving the desiccated seedlings back to the agar medium under \u2018control conditions\u2019 for 2\u2009days prior to harvest. Seedling hypocotyl length and root length were measured using <em>ImageJ</em> software<strong>[1]</strong>. ANOVA was used for calculating statistical differences.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Schneider CA, Rasband WS, Eliceiri KW.

Full scan MS (range 50-750\u2009m/z) were acquired with 35\u2009K resolution for both positive and negative mode in polarity switching. The target value based on predictive automatic gain control was 1.0 x 10^6 with 200\u2009ms of maximum injection time. The flow rate for sheath gas, aux gas and sweep gas was 50, 20 and 1 separately. The capillary temperature was 350\u2009\u00b0C. The S-lens RF was set to 55. The Aux gas heater temperature was 300\u2009\u00b0C. Targeted MS/MS acquisition was used during metabolite identification. The precursor ions were sequentially fragmented in the HCD collision cell with normalized collision energy of 10%, 20%, 40%. MS/MS scans were acquired with 17.5\u2009K resolution and the target value was 2.0 x 10^5 with 100\u2009ms of maximum injection time. An isolation width of 2.0\u2009m/z was used for precursor ion selection in MS/MS mode. GSH and GSSG were quantified by LC-HRMS using an external standard curve with 5, 50, 500\u2009nM of each standard. The LC-HRMS analysis was carried out using the same method described above. The final concentration of GSH and GSSG in the injected solutions was calculated using peak areas and response factors calculated from the standard curves.</p>",
