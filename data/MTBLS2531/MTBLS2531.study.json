                "description": "Longitudinal studies of gut microbiota following specific interventions are vital for understanding how they influence host health. However, robust longitudinal sampling of gut microbial communities is a major challenge, which can be addressed using in vitro fermenters hosting complex microbial communities. Here, by employing 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, we investigated the adaptation and succession of human fecal microbial communities in an automated in vitro fermenter. We performed two independent experiments each using a different human donor fecal sample \u2013 the first experiment was configured with two units of three colon compartments each studied for 22 days, and the second experiment with one unit of two colon compartments studied for 31 days. In both experiments, the fermenter maintained a trend of increasing microbial alpha-diversity along colon compartments, mimicking that of the human gastrointestinal tract. Within each experiment, microbial compositions followed compartment-specific trajectories over time and reached compartment-specific stable configurations. Microbial compositions were highly similar between the replicate units in the first experiment, thus showing reproducibility. Yet, microbial compositions and their trajectories were clearly separated between the two experiments, showing that these in vitro communities maintained the individuality of fecal inocula rather than converging on a fermenter-specific composition. Using longitudinal relative abundance profiles, we identified different dynamics exhibited by individual amplicon sequence variants (ASVs). While we could not detect some fecal ASVs in the in vitro communities, we observed that many ASVs undetected in the fecal sample flourished under in vitro conditions, which we named bloomers. In both experiments, bloomer ASVs accounted for significant proportions of ASV relative abundance after stabilization \u2013 69% and 43% in the descending compartments in the two experiments. Bloomer ASVs included clinically relevant microbes associated with human health such as Bacteroides fragilis and Akkermansia muciniphila. This turnover in community compositions is likely explained by feed composition and pH, suggesting that these communities can be modulated. We characterized the exometabolites in the first experiment, derived a microbe-exometabolite bipartite network for its descending colon compartment, and identified 6 coherent groups based on the exometabolites. Our results suggest that in vitro fermenters are promising tools to study complex microbial communities harboring important members of human gut microbiota.",

Labeled standards were acquired from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc. (Tewksbury, MA, USA). Electrospray ionization low-concentration tuning mix was purchased from Agilent Technologies (Santa Clara, CA, USA). Formic acid (&gt;=99.5%), Optima liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) grade, was purchased from Fisher Chemical (Pittsburgh, PA, USA).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>SHIME setup design, inoculation, and sample collection:</strong></p><p>All experiments were carried out using the <em>in vitro</em> digestion model SHIME, specifically the luminal SHIME (L-SHIME). The setups in our experiment were adapted from the TwinSHIME and QuadSHIME models (see <strong>Fig. S1</strong>&nbsp;in the paper associated with this study)<strong>[1]</strong>. Each unit in <strong>Exp1</strong> comprised a succession of 5 compartments (reactors) that simulated stomach (<strong>ST</strong>), small intestine (<strong>SI</strong>), ascending colon (<strong>AC</strong>), transverse colon (<strong>TC</strong>), and descending colon (<strong>DC</strong>), while the <strong>Exp2</strong> was performed with a combined stomach and small intestine (<strong>ST1SI</strong>) compartment, an <strong>AC</strong> compartment and a <strong>DC</strong> compartment<strong>[2]</strong>. All compartments were continuously stirred at 300 rpm, and the temperature was kept constant at 37 \u00b0C. Anaerobic conditions were maintained by flushing all compartments with 100% N2. The first 2 compartments of <strong>Exp1</strong> and the first compartment of <strong>Exp2</strong> were based on the fill-and-draw principle simulating stomach and small intestine, with a peristaltic pump adding 140 ml SHIME nutritional medium (ProDigest BVBA, Ghent, Belgium) and 60 ml pancreatic and bile liquid (ProDigest BVBA, Ghent, Belgium) in 3 cycles/day with an 8-h interval between cycles. The SHIME nutritional medium comprised arabinogalactan (1.2 g/l), pectin (2 g/l), xylan (0.5 g/l), glucose (0.4 g/l), yeast extract (3 g/l), special peptone (1 g/l), mucin (3 g/l), L-cysteine-HCl (0.5 g/l), and starch (4 g/ l). The pancreatic and bile liquid contained NaHCO3 (12.5 g/l), oxgall (6g/l), and pancreatin (0.9 g/l). The last 3 compartments of <strong>Exp1</strong> and the last 2 compartments of <strong>Exp2</strong> were continuously stirred compartments simulating colonic conditions. In <strong>Exp1</strong> and <strong>Exp2</strong>, for the colon compartments, the volume (V) and the pH were maintained as follows: for <strong>Exp1</strong>, the AC pH was 5.6 to 5.9 and V was 500 ml, the TC pH was 6.15 to 6.4 and V was 800 ml, and the DC pH was 6.6 to 6.9 and V was 600ml; for <strong>Exp2</strong>, the AC pH was 5.6 to 5.9 and V was 500 ml and the DC pH was 6.6 to 6.9 and V was 800 ml.</p><p><br></p><p>For the inoculation of colon compartments, the fecal inoculum was prepared from feces obtained from 2 anonymous human donors with no history of antibiotic use 6 months prior to the study. For this purpose, we used fresh fecal samples (less than 1 h after voiding). Fecal materials were mixed with anaerobic phosphate buffer in a 20% (wt/vol) proportion. The anaerobic phosphate buffer contained K2HPO4 (8.8 g/l), KH2PO4 (6.8 g/l), sodium thioglycolate (0.1 g/l), with the pH adjusted to 7, and was boiled to make it anaerobic. Prior to use, sodium dithionite (15 mg/l) was added to the buffer and stored at room temperature. The fecal suspension was then homogenized using the Stomacher 400 circulator (Seward, UK) at 300 rpm for 10 min. Upon homogenization, the suspension was centrifuged for 2 min at 500 x g to separate the inoculum (supernatant) from the debris. The inoculation was performed with the resulting fecal inoculum in 5% (vol/vol) proportions in all colon compartments.</p><p><br></p><p>For <strong>Exp1</strong>, samples (1 ml) were collected from <strong>AC</strong>, <strong>TC</strong>, and <strong>DC</strong> compartments in both units on days 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 20, 21, and 22, and for <strong>Exp2</strong>, samples were collected every second day for <strong>AC</strong> and <strong>DC</strong> compartments from day 1 until day 31. All collected samples were centrifuged at 6,000 rpm for 5 min to separate bacterial cells from the culture. In <strong>Exp1</strong>, for days 2, 7, 12, 17, and 22 as well as for fecal samples, triplicate sampling was performed. Upon centrifugation, both the bacterial pellet and culture supernatants were stored at 280 \u00b0C for further analysis.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Please note:</strong> there is <strong>no</strong> metabolomics data deposited for <strong>Exp2</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> de Wiele T, den Abbeele P, Ossieur W, Possemiers S, Marzorati M, 2015.

The ESI was set at a 3,500 V capillary voltage and a 300 kPa nebulizer pressure. Detection of the mass/charge ratio (m/z) of ions was set from 50 to 1,000 over 10 min. To facilitate the compound identifications, QC samples were analyzed by auto-MS/MS in positive and negative electrospray ionization modes. The absolute threshold was set to 1,000 counts. MS and MS/MS spectrum acquisition rates were set to 4 Hz, with a total cycle time of 1 s for precursor ion collection. The collision energy varied between 10 eV and 60 eV.</p>",
