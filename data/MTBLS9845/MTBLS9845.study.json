                "description": "Temperature is the primary environmental factor that restricts the growth and distribution of mangrove plants. With the escalating severity of global climate change, Kandelia obovata has gained widespread recognition as an ideal species for investigating the response mechanisms of mangroves to cold stress. Although previous studies have explored the genetic and molecular aspects of cold response in K. obovata, there is a paucity of reports focusing on its response to freezing stress and its adaptive mechanisms during recovery periods. In this study, we subjected two cultivars of K. obovata, namely southern F-J (Fu-Jian) and northern Z-J (Zhe-Jiang), located in the southeast coastal area of China, to controlled temperature drops below freezing point followed by recovery periods simulating typical cold waves. We conducted phenotype analyses along with comparative transcriptomics and metabolomics investigations on these two cultivars, which exhibited differential tolerance towards lethal freezing challenges. Our findings revealed stronger transcriptional and metabolic induction in both cultivars during recovery stages compared to freezing processes, highlighting candidate genes and metabolites that may enhance adaptability and survival capacity of K. obovata when exposed to cold waves. Furthermore, significant differences were observed between these two cultivars in various pathways related to cold responses such as photosynthesis and jasmonic acid synthesis/transduction; while F-J cultivar failed to resume growth due to irreversibly damaged photosystems/cell structures after exposure to extreme low temperatures, Z-J cultivar demonstrated resistance by adjusting JA synthesis as well as accumulating soluble amino acids during their respective recovery periods. This study provides novel insights into understanding the survival mechanisms employed by K. obovata against cold waves, which are crucial for introducing mangroves into more northern coastal areas.",

After filtering, minimum metabolite values were imputed for specific samples in which the metabolite levels fell below the lower limit of quantitation and each Metabolic features were normalized by sum. In order to reduce the errors caused by sample preparation and instrument instability, the response intensity of the sample mass spectrum peaks was normalized by the sum normalization method, and the normalized data matrix was obtained. At the same time, variables with relative standard deviation (RSD) &gt; 30% of QC samples were removed, and log10 logarithmization was performed to obtain the final data matrix for subsequent analysis.</p>",
