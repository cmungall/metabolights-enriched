                "description": "<p>Horticulturists are interested in evaluating how cultivar, environment, or production system inputs can affect postharvest quality. Ambient mass spectrometry approaches enable analysis of minimally processed samples under ambient conditions and offer an attractive high-throughput alternative for assessing quality characteristics in plant products. Here, we evaluate direct analysis in real time (DART-MS) mass spectrometry and rapid evaporative ionization-mass spectrometry (REIMS) to assess quality characteristics in various pepper (<em>Capsicum annuum L.</em>) cultivars. DART-MS exhibited the ability to discriminate between pod colors and pungency based on chemical fingerprints, while REIMS could distinguish pepper market class (e.g., bell, lunchbox, and popper). Furthermore, DART-MS analysis resulted in the putative detection of important bioactive compounds in human diet such as vitamin C, p-coumaric acid, and capsaicin. The results of this study demonstrate the potential for these approaches as accessible and reliable tools for high throughput screening of pepper quality.</p>",

The average daily temperature in the greenhouse was 25 \u00b0C and the relative humidity was 50%. The transplants were hardened by placing them outside under an insect-netting covered high tunnel with the east and west end walls removed for 7 d prior to transplanting. Pepper plants were grown between 5 June and 3 Oct. 2019 in a field at the Agricultural Research, Development and Education Center (ARDEC) South in Fort Collins, CO (lat. 40\u00b036\u2019N., long. 104\u00b059\u2019W.) elevation 1,524 m. The pepper cultivars were planted 0.5 m apart in black plastic mulched beds, which were spaced 1.8 m apart. Macronutrient needs (57 kg/acre nitrogen) were met with monthly applications of Drammatic 'One' (4-4-0.5) fertilizer (Dramm Corporation, Manitowoc, WI) through the drip irrigation system. Black plastic drip tape emitting water at a rate of 500 L/h/100 m with emitters spaced 20 cm apart was used to irrigate the crop. Using an irrigation controller, we provided 15-30 min of irrigation once or twice daily. The crop was scouted for pests in the field on a weekly basis. Fully mature pepper pods were harvested on 9 and 23 Sept. as well as on 3 Oct. 2019. The pods were stored in 7 \u00b0C walk-in cooler until quality characteristics could be evaluated via DART-MS. Fresh pods were taken to the lab where they were stored in a 7 \u00b0C refrigerator until they could be rinsed with deionized water and dried with disposable paper towels. Pepper pungency was determined by the cultivar description in grower seed catalogs or by speaking with the pepper breeder. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>REIMS:</strong></p><p>Approximately 24 pepper samples were purchased for each of the 2 market classes, bell and popper (see <strong>Table S3</strong> in the paper associated with this study) from Whole Foods Market (Fort Collins, CO) on 12 Feb. 2018. On the same day, 5 bags of ~24 tri-color (red, yellow, orange) sweet mini lunchbox pepper phenotypes were purchased from King Soopers (Kroger supermarket, Fort Collins, CO). </p><p><br></p>",

The y-axis indicates statistical significance using -log10 FDR adjusted p values (\u03b1 = 0.05) for 333 metabolites. Sphere colors, red and green, indicate metabolite class. The vertical dashed lines are the threshold for red/green [log2(red/green) &lt; -1.0 or &gt; 1.0]. The volcano plot for the sweet and pungent pepper metabolite comparison was constructed using a similar approach where sweet was divided by pungent for 368 metabolites. The heat map, which is based on z-scores for each pepper pod color and putatively annotated mass bins, was generated using the pheatmap function in R.

From this piece, 2 mm thick cross-sectional cuts were made to expose the <strong>exocarp</strong>, <strong>mesocarp</strong>, and <strong>endocarp</strong> tissue. The sliced pepper samples were laid sideways on the tablet carrier adapter for the sample introduction rail system (IonSense, Inc., Saugus, MA).</p><p><br></p><p>The DART-MS analysis was conducted using the DART-Standardized Voltage and Pressure (DART-SVP) model ion source (IonSense, Inc., Saugus, MA). It was coupled to a single quadrupole mass spectrometer (ACQUITY QDa; Waters Corporation, Manchester, UK) via a VAPUR interface (IonSense, Inc., Saugus, MA). The DART-SVP was equipped with a motorized linear rail where the tablet carrier was mounted. The helium flow rate for the ion source was set to ~3 L/min heated to 350 \u00b0C. The cone voltage was set to 20 V. The speed of the motorized linear rail system holding the tablet carrier adapter was set to 1.0 mm/s. The standby temperature was held at 245 \u00b0C. The samples were arranged on the 10 Tablet module (metal rail) such that 3 pepper sub-samples from the same pod were placed in every other tablet location. This allowed the signal from each sample to return to the baseline before the next acquisition could be started.</p><p><br></p><p>Authentic analytical standards for <strong>p-coumaric acid,</strong> <strong>capsaicin</strong>, and <strong>L-ascorbic acid</strong> were analyzed using the same instrument conditions with the exception of the sample introduction (\u226598% purity) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). A 10 mg/ml solution was made for <strong>L-ascorbic acid</strong> using HPLC grade water. Solutions (10 mg/ml) were made for <strong>p-coumaric acid</strong>, <strong>trans-p-coumaric acid</strong>, and <strong>capsaicin</strong> using 100% ethanol. 12 replicates of each sample were run through the DART using the DIP-IT method. This involved dipping individual 10 \u00b5l glass capillary rods into each solution and placing the rods into the DIP IT module holder, which allowed the analytical standards to pass directly in front of the ionizing source.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>REIMS:</strong></p><p>Analysis was performed as a randomized complete block design with 16 replicates. The individual pepper phenotypes were cut into thirds. The <strong>exocarp</strong> of the pod was placed flat on the conduction pad so that the <strong>mesocarp</strong> was exposed. The 'iKnife' was held perpendicular to the <strong>mesocarp</strong> tissue so the vacuum component could draw in the smoke generated by the ionizing source.</p><p><br></p><p>The chemical fingerprint was detected using the protocol described<strong>[1]</strong>. Briefly, the samples were analyzed using a Synapt G2 Si Q-ToF, fitted with a REIMS ionization source attached to a monopolar electrosurgical hand piece called an 'iKnife' (Waters Corporation, Manchester, UK). It was powered with an Erbotom ICC 300 electrosurgical generator (Erbe Elektromedizin GmbH, Turbingen, Germany) using the 'liquid coagulation' mode at a power of 40 W. A solution of 2 ng/ml leucine-enkephalin at a continual flow rate of 200 \u00b5l/min was directed to the REIMS source during sampling. The heater bias was set to 80 V and the cone voltage was set to 20 V. At least 3 'burns' were collected from each sample within a 3 cm X 3 cm square from the centre of the pod. Each burn lasted approximately 3 s.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Gredell DA, Schroeder AR, Belk KE, Broeckling CD, Heuberger AL, Kim SY, King DA, Shackelford SD, Sharp JL, Wheeler TL, Woerner DR, Prenni JE.
