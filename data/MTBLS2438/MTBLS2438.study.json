                "description": "<p>Synbiotics may modulate gut microbiota and prevent infections. In a randomized controlled trial (NCT01625273) infants weaned from breast milk were fed formula with prebiotics (fructo- and galactooligosaccharides) or the same prebiotic formula with <em>Lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei</em> strain F19 (synbiotics) from 1 until 6 months of age. The objective was to examine synbiotic effects on gut microbiota maturation. Fecal samples collected at ages 1, 4, 6 and 12 months (324 samples for microbial and 197 samples for metabolic characterization) were analyzed. We demonstrate enrichment of Bifidobacterium and increases in antimicrobial metabolites derived from microbial fermentation of phenylalanine and pectins in the synbiotic group. The gut microbiota of infants with lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) were depleted of Lactobacillales but enriched in Klebsiella species and associated antimicrobial resistance genes. These compositional and functional changes of the gut microbiota may be linked to the previously reported reduction of LRTI in the synbiotic group.</p>",

Exclusion criteria were any malformation, handicap or congenital disease that could impact growth, antibiotic treatment, or previous intake of infant formula with pre- and/or probiotics. 4 hospitals in Poland (Warsaw, Bydgoszcz, Trzebnica, and Garwolin) or outpatient clinics recruited infants from January 2011 until March 2016. Parents were informed and invited to participate only if infants were not breastfed.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Interventions and procedures:</strong></p><p>Eligible infants were randomized to intake of cow's milk-based infant formula with FOS/GOS (control, prebiotic formula) or identical formula with the addition of Lactobacillus F19 (experimental, synbiotic formula) at a dose of 10^9 colony-forming units per L of formula. The study formulas were dispensed from inclusion (age 28 d at the latest) until age 6 mth (intervention period). The study products\u2019 composition has been published previously<strong>[1]</strong>. Parents were advised to follow standard recommendation on introduction of complementary foods (not before 17 wk of age and not later than at 26 wk of age)<strong>[2]</strong>. Study visits took place every 28 d (\u00b17 d) until age 4 mth. Thereafter study visits took place within 14 d of ages 6, 9 and 12 mth.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Stool Sample Collection:</strong></p><p>Stool samples were collected at home, by spatula into sterile containers at 1, 4, 6 and 12 mth of age and stored immediately at home in the freezer. Samples were transported frozen to the research centers both in Poland and Sweden where samples were stored at -70\u00b0 C until analyses.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Szajewska H, Ruszczy\u0144ski M, Szyma\u0144ski H, Sadowska-Krawczenko I, Piwowarczyk A, Rasmussen PB, Kristensen MB, West CE, Hernell O.

The tungsten bead was removed, and the samples were centrifuged at 4 \u00b0C, 14,000 rpm, for 10 min. 25 \u00b5l of supernatant was transferred to microvials and evaporated to dryness in a speed-vac concentrator. Solvents were evaporated, and the samples were stored at -80 \u00b0C until analysis. A small aliquot of the remaining supernatants was pooled and used to create quality control (QC) samples. MS2 analysis (LC-MS) was run on the QC samples for identification purposes.

Mass spectra and retention index comparison was performed using <strong>NIST MS 2.0</strong> software. Annotation of mass spectra was based on reverse and forward searches in the library. Masses and ratio between masses indicative of a derivatized metabolite were especially notified. If the mass spectrum according to SMC's experience was with the highest probability indicative of a metabolite and the retention index between the sample and library for the suggested metabolite was \u00b15 (usually less than 3) the deconvoluted 'peak' was annotated as an identification of a metabolite.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Gullberg J, Jonsson P, Nordstr\u00f6m A, Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m M, Moritz T.
