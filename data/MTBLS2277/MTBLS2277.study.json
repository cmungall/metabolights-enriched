                "description": "Group-living individuals experience immense risk of disease transmission and parasite infection. In social and in some non-social insects, disease control with immunomodulation arises not only via individual immune defenses, but also via infochemicals such as contact cues and (defensive) volatiles to mount a group-level immunity. However, little is known about whether activation of the immune system elicits changes in chemical phenotypes, which may mediate these responses. We here asked whether individual immune experience resulting from wounding or injection of heat-killed Bacillus thuringiensis (priming) leads to changes in the chemical profiles of female and male adult red flour beetles, Tribolium castaneum, which are non-social but gregarious. We analyzed insect extracts using GC-FID to study the chemical composition of (1) cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) as candidates for the transfer of immunity-related information between individuals via contact, and (2) stink gland secretions, with analysis of benzoquinones as main active compounds regulating \u2018external immunity\u2019. Despite a pronounced sexual dimorphism in CHC profiles, wounding stimulation led to similar profile changes in males and females with increases in the proportion of methyl-branched alkanes compared to na\u00efve beetles. While changes in the overall secretion profiles were less pronounced, absolute amounts of benzoquinones were transiently elevated in wounded compared to na\u00efve females. Responses to priming were insignificant in CHCs and secretions. We suggest that changes in different infochemicals after wounding may mediate immune status signaling in the context of both internal and external immune responses in groups of this non-social insect, thus showing parallels to social immunity.",

For this experiment, around 2000 1-month old adult beetles were allowed to mate and oviposit for 24 h in approximately 350 g flour.</p><p><br></p><p>A culture of&nbsp;<em>Bacillus thuringiensis&nbsp;</em>bv.<em>&nbsp;tenebrionis</em>&nbsp;was obtained from Bacillus Genetic Stock Center (Ohio State University, USA). The species is&nbsp;a bacterial pathogen of beetles, and immune priming&nbsp;via&nbsp;injection of this bacterium has been demonstrated in previous work<strong>[2]</strong>.&nbsp;Heat-killed vegetative cells at 1 x 10^9&nbsp;cells/mL&nbsp;used for the immune stimulation treatment were prepared as previously described<strong>[3][4]</strong>. To prepare the bacterial culture, 100 \u00b5L of a&nbsp;<em>Bacillus thuringiensis</em>&nbsp;bv.&nbsp;<em>tenebrionis</em>&nbsp;freezer stock (stored at -80 \u00b0C) was inoculated into a 500 mL baffled flask containing 50 mL Luria Broth (Carl Roth GmbH + Co. KG) and the culture was incubated at 30 \u00b0C, 200 rpm for 15 h in dark. Subsequently, the culture was transferred into a 50 mL Falcon&nbsp;conical tube and centrifuged at 3645 x&nbsp;g&nbsp;at 4 \u00b0C for 10 min. The bacterial pellet was washed once with phosphate buffered saline (PBS, Calbiochem) and the concentration adjusted to 1 x 10^9 cells/mL. PBS (as injection/wounding control) and bacteria solution (for heat-killed&nbsp;<em>B. thuringiensis</em>&nbsp;bv.&nbsp;<em>tenebrionis</em> injecting treatment, \u2018priming\u2019) were heated at 95 \u00b0C for 30 min to heat-kill the bacteria. All procedures were carried out under a horizontal laminar air-flow hood to keep the conditions sterile.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Immune Treatment</strong></p><p>Briefly, 10 days after oviposition, all experimental beetles were individually placed into sterile 96-well plates (Type F, Sarstedt) containing 0.08 g flour per well to minimize any injuries due to conspecific cannibalism or mating<strong>[5]-[7]</strong>. And 1 week post eclosion, virgin beetles of both sexes were divided into 3 treatment groups: Untreated as the handling control (\u2018na\u00efve\u2019), injected with sterile PBS (\u2018wounded\u2019) and heat-killed&nbsp;<em>B. thuringiensis&nbsp;</em>bv<em>.&nbsp;tenebrionis</em>&nbsp;injected (\u2018primed\u2019). For the latter 2 treatments, 18.4 nL (~20,000 cells per injection in the \u2018primed\u2019 treatment) of solution was injected into the body cavity of adults with a nanoinjector (Drummond Nanoject II) between the head and pronotum laterally towards the abdomen. Subsequently, beetles were transferred into clean 96-well plates without flour, to reduce the contamination of samples by faecal material and flour.</p><p><br></p><p>For the profiling of cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) at 18 h post treatment, we prepared n = 6 samples per sex and treatment with 4 beetles pooled into each sample.&nbsp;The sampling time was chosen based on a previous study that reported transfer of immunity within 18 h post treatment<strong>[8]</strong>.&nbsp;For the stink gland secretion collection at 24 and 72 h post treatment, we obtained n = 8 samples of individual beetles per sex, treatment and timepoint. These 2 timepoints were chosen to test the time course of the stink gland responses to the treatment.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Milutinovi\u0107 B, Stolpe C, Peu\u03b2 R, Armitage SA, Kurtz J.

After centrifugation, 100 \u00b5L of each extract was dried under reduced pressure and resolved in 80 \u00b5L of&nbsp;n-hexane. The volume of&nbsp;n-hexane was scaled down accordingly in 3 samples, where less than 4 beetles were available. For each set of samples (secretions and CHCs), 4 blank samples were prepared alongside with the beetle samples but did not contain beetles. For extraction of stink gland secretions, individual beetles were transferred to tubes that were immersed in ice water at 3 \u00b0C for 3 min to stimulate the release of secretions<strong>[1]</strong>. Beetles were then freeze-killed&nbsp;at -20 \u00b0C and shaken in 65 \u00b5L ice-cold acetone (LC-MS grade, Sigma-Aldrich) containing 0.05 mg/mL&nbsp;octadecane (98.5%, Sigma-Aldrich) as internal standard at 4 \u00b0C for 5 min.

For the analysis of stink gland secretions, a sample volume of 1 \u00b5L was injected with a split ratio of 3 at a constant stream of hydrogen flow of 1.13 mL/min. The column oven temperature was set at 50 \u00b0C, held for 2 min and increased to 300 \u00b0C with a rate of 10 \u00b0C/min, followed by a holding time of 10 min.

Standards of MBQ (98% purity), methyl-1,4-hydroquinone (99%, both Sigma-Aldrich) and ethyl-1,4-hydroquinone (97%, Abcr) were analyzed using the method for gland secretions.
