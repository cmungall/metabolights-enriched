                "description": "INTRODUCTION: The surveillance of illegal anabolic practices in bovine meat production is necessary to guarantee consumers\u2019 health. Screening strategies based on the recognition of indirect biological effects are considered by the community as promising tools to overcome some limitations of classical analytical methods and might therefore concur to ensure safer food for the consumer.\n</br>\nOBJECTIVES: The present work aims at characterizing the metabolic profile induced in liver by administration of anabolic steroids, and at identifying potential disturbances in the hepatic metabolism.\n</br>\nMETHODS: A total of 32 liver samples, 16 from untreated bulls and 16 from bulls treated with an ear implant (Revalor-XS\u00ae) containing trenbolone acetate (200 mg) and \u00df-estradiol (40 mg), were analyzed following a LC\u2013MS-based metabolomic analysis combining RP and HILIC chromatographic separations. Different multivariate statistical tools were applied to the datasets to select common metabolites that may be considered as potential markers based on their significant changes in concentrations after administration of sexual steroids.\n</br>\nRESULTS:Eight candidate markers were identified. Moreover, a subset of four markers was also validated by a different laboratory that performed the same analysis using an independent instrumental and elaboration platform, confirming the robustness of the results achieved.\n</br>\nCONCLUSION: This study was performed mimicking experimental conditions that may be used during a potential misuse practice. It is promising in the objective of setting up an analytical strategy to highlight sexual steroids abuse in livestock animals.",

                        "description": "The Frame MZ algorithm embedded in SIEVE was used for candidate metabolite markers identification. Precursor mass tolerance was set to 5 ppm, and K, NH4, Na, H were selected as possible adducts for positive polarity, while only H adduct was selected for negative polarity. Metabolite identification was performed by comparing the measured mass of candidate markers with the exact mass of the metabolites present in the KEGG database.\n</p>\nTo confirm the identification of potential markers based on exact mass and mass spectra database, a solution containing reference standard metabolites available on the market was analysed together with a QC liver sample in the same analytical sequence (MSI Level 1). So, a standard solution of xanthine, D-glucuronic acid, gluconic acid, galactitol, DL-pantothenic acid, hexanoyl-L-carnitine, cholic acid, and glycocholic acid was injected under the different LC\u2013MS standardized conditions. Fragmentation spectra were acquired using an inclusion list reporting the expected RT (2 min window) and different CE (35 and 45 eV, or 30 and 45 eV) for the characterization of the metabolites to be identified. Data were acquired at 140,000 resolution FWHM, and using triggered MS/MS fragmentation of precursor ions.",
