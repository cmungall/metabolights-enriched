                "description": "<p>From an animal production and health perspective, our understanding of the metabolites in ruminant biofluids, particularly rumen fluid across different host species is poorly understood. Metabolomics is a powerful and sensitive approach for investigating low molecular weight metabolite profiles present in rumen biofluids. It can be used to identify potential roles of metabolites in the rumen microbiome and provide and understanding of host-level regulatory mechanisms associated with animal production. The rumen is a strictly anaerobic environment enriched with a complex community of bacteria, protozoa, fungi, archaea and bacteriophages. Here, we present a metabolomic dataset generated using hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) and semi-polar (C18) chromatography methods coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry (MS), collected in both positive and negative ionization modes, of ovine rumen samples that were fractionated based on molecular weight (20 kDa, 8-10 kDa and 100 Da). This study highlights the potential of HILIC and C18 chromatography combined with non-targeted mass spectrometric methods to detect the polar and semi-polar metabolite species of the ruminal fluid metabolome.</p>",

                        "description": "<p><strong>Animal, Diet and Rumen Contents Sampling:</strong></p><p>Whole rumen content samples were collected post-mortem and pooled from 5 sheep grazing ad libitum on a ryegrass and clover pasture diet. Approximately 5 l of rumen contents were collected from each animal and filtered through 4 layers of cheesecloth (335 \u03bcm mesh) to remove plant material present in the digesta (see <strong>Fig. 1A</strong> in the paper associated with this study). The pH of each sample was determined immediately after sampling using a pH meter (6.6). Filtered rumen fluid was immediately processed so as not to alter the fermentative capacity of the ruminal fluid. Sampling was conducted in December 2018 at AgResearch Grasslands Research Centre (Palmerston North, New Zealand) under the approval of the AgResearch Grasslands Animal Ethics Committee.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Dialysis and Fractionation of Whole Rumen Content:</strong></p><p>A method was developed to acquire dialyzed rumen fluid (DRF) fractions that enrich for different sized components of rumen fluid for metabolomics and lipidomics analyses (see <strong>Fig. 1B</strong> in the paper associated with this study). DRF fractions based on 3 molecular weight cut-offs (MWCO) were obtained using Spectra-Por Float-A-Lyzer G2 dialysis systems with MWCOs of 20 kDa (Z726931, Sigma-Aldrich), 8-10 kDa (Z726605, Sigma-Aldrich) and 100 Da (Z727253, Sigma-Aldrich). Briefly, the pooled and filtered RF contents were mixed and divided evenly into 4 Schott gas washing bottles fitted with Drechsel type head connections (GL 14, DURAN). The analytical conditions in vitro were identical to the animal\u2019s physiological conditions, with a temperature of 39 \u00b0C in anaerobic conditions obtained by insufflating a stream of O2-free CO2 inside the container with constant mixing. To obtain each DRF fraction, 5 replicates of each individual MWCO apparatus were dialyzed against 10 ml of autoclaved phosphate buffered saline (1\u00d7 PBS, 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 8 mM Na2HPO4, and 2 mM KH2PO4, pH 7.4) buffer overnight at 39 \u00b0C in a water bath. Additional containers were prepared in parallel containing only PBS and distilled water as control treatments. The principles of dialysis allowed small compounds to migrate from high concentration (rumen fluid contents) to low concentration (dialysis systems containing saline). DRF fractions and samples of digesta obtained from different phases of the process were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept on dry ice until long term storage at -80 \u00b0C.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Production and Procurement of H. contortus:</strong></p><p>Pure cultures of model gastrointestinal parasitic nematode, <em>Haemonchus contortus</em> (barber's pole worm) third-stage larvae (L3) were maintained by regular passage through 5 otherwise parasite-free lambs housed indoors at the AgResearch\u2019s Grasslands campus. L3 were cultured in fresh faecal material containing eggs collected into faecal bags on infected sheep. Faeces were pooled and mixed with vermiculite then placed in trays, moistened with tap water (at 20 \u00b0C), covered and cultured for 10 days at 22-24 \u00b0C. A modified Baermann technique was used to clean and separate the larvae from faeces. Briefly, approximately 150 g of faeces was enclosed in paper facial tissues and suspended over a large conical measuring flask filled with tap water. The samples were incubated for 20 hr and washed by their movement through the apparatus. The faeces were then removed and the liquid carefully siphoned to a remaining volume of about 20 ml. The resulting L3s and volume were examined in a counting chamber (Whitlock S.F.E.L.O., Australia; volume 2 ml) at x100 magnification and stored in tap water at 10 \u00b0C until required.</p><p><br></p><p>Pooled L3 cultures were cleaned and acclimated overnight to room temperature by gravity migration filtration into autoclaved PBS solution through nylon mesh (pore size 20 \u03bcm). As control treatments, dH2O or anaerobic 1x PBS solution (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 8 mM Na2HPO4, and 2 mM KH2PO4, pH 7.4) was mixed in boiling dH2O and cooled to room temperature under a continuous flow of O2-free CO2. Once cooled, the PBS solution was transferred to 100 ml serum bottles in 70 ml aliquots and flushed with CO2 for 1 hr. The bottles were sealed with butyl rubber bungs and sealed with aluminium crimp caps before being autoclaved at 121 \u00b0C for 20 min. The DRF fractions were also transferred to serum bottles, flushed with CO2 and sealed as described above, but not autoclaved prior to use.</p><p><br></p><p>Larval cultures were transferred anaerobically (approximately 200,000 L3/sample) using a O2-free CO2-flushed 3 ml syringe and wide bore hypodermic needle (16 G thickness and length of 1-1/2 inch, BD), into aluminium-wrapped and pre-warmed serum bottles containing 70 ml of autoclaved PBS, and incubated anaerobically at 39 \u00b0C with gentle horizontal shaking at 75 rpm for 12 hr in darkness. For each treatment, 5 biological replicates and 3 technical replicates were performed.</p>",

LC-MS analyses were done in both positive and negative electrospray ionization (ESI) modes.</p><p><br></p><p>Upon collection, the DRF fractions were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, transferred to glass vials and stored at -80 \u00b0C until further use. 7 aliquots of 1 ml each (5 for analyses and 2 for quality control samples (QC)) of each sample were transferred into microcentrifuge tubes. The 2 QC samples<strong>[4]</strong> were pooled and solely used for monitoring sample degradation, tracking run-order effects within a batch, and quality control purposes only. Briefly, samples were thawed overnight at 4 \u00b0C, centrifuged (4 \u00b0C, 11,000 x g) for 10 min and 200 \u03bcl of supernatant transferred into a 2 ml micro-centrifuge tube. An extraction solvent comprising 800 \u03bcl of chloroform:methanol (1:1; v/v) was added and samples were vortexed (1 min).

Finally, samples were vortexed (1 min), and 100 \u03bcl was transferred to a glass insert in an auto-sampler vial for LC-MS analysis. For polar and semi-polar compounds, hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) and C18 chromatography were applied, respectively[1]-[3]. For these analyses, supernatants (200 \u03bcl) were mixed with 800 \u03bcl of pre-chilled chloroform:methanol (1:1, v/v) containing 1.6 mg/l of internal standards; d5-Ltryptophan, d4-citric acid, d10-leucine, d2-tyrosine, d35-stearic acid, d5-benzoic acid, 13C2-glucose, and d7-alanine. 2 aliquots of the upper aqueous layer (200 \u03bcl) was taken and evaporated as above, then reconstituted in 200 \u03bcl of the extraction solvents (acetonitrile:water containing 0.1% formic acid; 1:1 for HILIC and 1:9 for C18, v/v).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Pahalagedara ASNW, Flint S, Palmer J, Subbaraj A, Brightwell G, Gupta TB.

Both full and data dependent MS2 (ddMS2) scans were collected in profile data acquisition mode. For full scan mode, a mass resolution setting of 35,000 was set to record a mass range of m/z 200-2000 with a maximum trap fill time of 250 ms. In ddMS2, MS2 measurements are activated when a set peak intensity threshold is achieved. For ddMS2 scan mode, the same mass resolution setting was maintained with a maximum trap fill time of 120 ms. The isolation window of selected MS1 scans was \u00b1 1.5 m/z with a normalized collision energy of 30. Samples were run in both positive and negative ionization modes separately. Positive ion mode parameters were as follows: spray voltage, 4.0 kV; capillary temperature, 275 \u00b0C; capillary voltage, 90 V; tube lens 120 V. Negative ion mode parameters were as follows: spray voltage, -2.5 kV; capillary temperature, 275 \u00b0C; capillary voltage, -90 V; tube lens, -100 V. The nitrogen source gas desolvation settings were the same for both modes (arbitrary units): sheath gas, 40; auxiliary gas, 10; sweep gas, 5.</p><p><br></p><p>Pooled sample from all conditioned DRF fraction extracts and internal standards were used as controls and samples were run in randomised order to avoid bias due to any inherent variation due to run order. Blank subtraction was applied after internal standard correction. To verify and maintain data quality, the QC sample was injected once every 10 samples. Retention time, signal intensity, and mass error of the internal standard were constantly monitored during the runs. Fragmentation data on approximately 4 samples in total per ionization mode (positive and negative) were used for identification of metabolite ions/classes.</p>",

The fold change (<strong>FC</strong> \u2265 2), p-value (p &lt; 0.1), and intensity thresholds (10,000) were defined for peak ranking. The identity of significantly differential peaks were further determined from the exact mass composition using <strong>HMDB[3]</strong>, <strong>LIPID MAPS[4]</strong>, <strong>METLIN[5]</strong>, <strong>LMDB[6]</strong>, <strong>BMDB[7]</strong>, <strong>PubChem</strong> and <strong>mzCloud</strong> databases.</p><p><br></p><p>Because only sparse fragmentation spectra (MS2) were collected for positive mode ions and no MS2 for negative mode ions in this study we used the correlation structure of peaks for metabolite identification. Unless otherwise specified, we carried out <strong>MSI</strong> (Metabolomics Standards Initiative) <strong>level 2</strong> metabolite annotation as evidenced by chromatographic behaviour, library search based on accurate mass (&lt; 10 ppm error) and the match of isotopic peak intensity between experimental and theoretical spectrum. For peaks detected with C18 and HILIC chromatography, after the filtering of 13C isotopic peaks and early eluting peaks (&lt;1 min) were left for annotation in each ionization stream. Metabolite identification was based on the match of m/z ([M+H], [M+NH4] or [M-H], within 5 ppm accuracy) with those in <strong>HMDB</strong> and in-house retention time databases. In addition, we exploited the correlation structure of top peaks to assist the annotation. Correlated peaks due to coelution may indicate the similar physio-chemical properties of eluting metabolites, or in-source fragment ions<strong>[8]</strong>. The presence of in-source fragment peaks helps identify the molecular ion for correct annotation of the metabolite. On the other hand, peak correlation among biological samples may suggest the origin of candidate metabolites, providing additional information for annotation.</p><p><br></p><p>For identifying significant peaks (<strong>FDR corrected p value</strong> \u2264 0.05, FC \u2265 1) as potential ovine rumen fluid metabolome products, a multi-group comparison between the DRF fractions (20 kDa, 8-10 kDa, 100 Da) groups was performed (see <strong>Fig 2</strong> in the paper associated with this study). An initial prerequisite for our downstream comparative multimodal analyses was that a peak needed to be present in \u2265 3 of the 5 biological replicates across each of the metabolomics analysis. Univariate hypothesis testing of the peaks was carried out using <strong>Permutation ANOVAs</strong> as implemented in the <strong>lmPerm R package version 2.1[9]</strong> with 1 million permutations, after which, significance was determined for the peaks using the <strong>Benjamini-Hochberg FDR-corrected p-values[10]</strong> (FDR p value &lt; 0.05).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Forsberg EM, Huan T, Rinehart D, Benton HP, Warth B, Hilmers B, Siuzdak G.
