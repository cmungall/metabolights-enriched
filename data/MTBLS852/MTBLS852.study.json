                "description": "Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular protozoan parasite that poses a severe threat to human health, especially those immune-compromised individuals. Sulfadiazine sodium (SDZ) is widely used for the treatment of human toxoplasmosis. However, systems biology researches on the therapeutic effects and mechanisms are not yet well performed. After T. gondii GT1 (Genotype I) infection, BALB/c mice were treated orally with SDZ (250 \u00b5g/mL in water) for consecutive 12 days. Mice showed typical acute toxoplasmosis symptoms on day 20 post infection, and 20 percent survived on day 30 post infection and established a chronic infection. An untargeted metabolomics approach based on an UPLC-MS/MS method was employed to identify the serum metabolic changes during SDZ treatment. Multivariate statistical analyses (PCA and PLS-DA) were employed to profile the serum metabolomes from the control mice, acute infection mice and SDZ treated mice. In total, 16,426 metabolite ions could be detected and 14,039 of them were consistently detected in more than 70% of the runs. Our results identified common and uniquely perturbed metabolites and pathways among acutely infected or SDZ treated groups. Acutely infected mice showed a dramatic global metabolic perturbations, and SDZ had a favorable therapeutic effect on parasite-induced acute toxoplasmosis by adjusting the metabolic disorders. Notably, serum metabolomics is proved to be a powerful and reliable approach into the surveillance of disease progression and treatment. More importantly, findings in this study will help provide useful data support for the development of new and safe pharmaceuticals against human toxoplasmosis.",

T. gondii type I GT1 strain was used in this study.\n</br></br>\n2 series of experiments were performed. In the first experiment, we sought to determine the optimal time of SDZ administration to enhance the animal survival rate. 40 mice were intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected with 10^3 T. gondii GT1 parasites. Meanwhile, another 10 mice i.p. infused with saline served as controls. After 2 days, the infected mice were randomized and divided into one un-treatment group (n = 10, saline) and 3 treatment groups. The 3 treatment groups (10 mice per group) were treated orally with sulfadiazine (250 \u00b5g/ml) diluted in filtered drinking water for 8, 10 or 12 consecutive days, respectively. The administration dosage of 250 \u00b5g/ml per day was chosen based on a previous report[1]. Control and un-treatment animals received a saline vehicle only. In the second experiment, we determined the optimal dosage of administration. 50 BALB/c mice were randomized assigned into one un-treated group (n = 10, saline) and four treatment groups after 2 days post T. gondii infection. Infected mice were treated orally with sulfadiazine of different concentrations (100, 150, 250 or 300 \u00b5g/mL). The death of mice was recorded daily and the survival curve of mice was built with the software GraphPad Prism.\n</br></br>\nSerum was collected from the control group that was designated as normal control (Control). Serum collected from un-treated mice at 6 dpi was designated as acutely infected group (Acute). Serum collected from the treated mice at the same day was designated as T6. Serum collected from the treated mice at 20 dpi was designated as T20. Serum collected from the treated mice at 30 dpi was designated as T30. The blood samples were prepared as previously described[2]. Briefly, blood was collected rapidly into Eppendorf tubes by retro-orbital bleed and allowed to clot for 2 hr followed by centrifugation at 3000 x g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C. Supernatants were collected and frozen into liquid N2 for 3 min, and transferred to \u221280 \u00b0C freezer until analysis.\n</br></br>\nRef:\n[1] Zeng YB, Zhu SH, Dong H, Han HY, Jiang LL, Wang Q, Cheng J, Zhao QP, Ma WJ, Huang B.

The separation of all samples was performed on an ACQUITY UPLC BEH C18 column (Waters, U.K.) (dimension 100 x 2.1 mm, 1.8 \u03bcm particle size). A gradient elution program was run for chromatographic separation with mobile phase A (water) and mobile phase B (acetonitrile) as follows: 0~2 min, 100% A-100% A; 2~12 min, 100% A-0% A; 12~14 min, 0% A-0% A; 14~15 min, 0% A-100% A. The injection volume was 10 \u03bcl and the flow rate was set as 0.4 ml/min.\n</br></br>\nIn order to evaluate the stability and reproducibility of the LC-MS analytical platform during the acquisition, quality control (QC) samples were also analyzed. QC samples were prepared by mixing equal volumes (10 \u03bcl) from each serum sample as they were aliquoted for analysis. This \u201cpooled\u201d sample was used to provide a 'mean' profile representing all analytes encountered during the analysis. The pooled 'QC' sample was run 10 times at the beginning of the analysis and then prior to and after each batch of 10 serum samples to ensure system equilibration.",

To further increase the confidence in the identification and reduce the number of false hits, MS/MS spectra for the characteristic ions and fragmentation patterns of the compound was matched against reference spectra in HMDB, METLIN, and mzcloud (http://www.mzcloud.org)[3]. Quantitatively different metabolites were mapped to the reference pathway in the online Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database (KEGG, http://www.genome.jp/kegg/). Significant enriched pathways were assessed on the basis of the false discovery rate-adjusted hypergeometric test statistic (p\u2264 0.05).\n</br></br>\nRef:\n[1] Smith CA, O'Maille G, Want EJ, Qin C, Trauger SA, Brandon TR, Custodio DE, Abagyan R, Siuzdak G.
