                "description": "<p>Increasing studies associating glycerophospholipids with various pathological conditions highlight the need for their thorough characterization. However, the intricate composition of the lipidome due to the presence of lipid isomers poses significant challenges to structural lipidomics. This study uses the anodic corrosion of two metals in a single theta nESI emitter as a tool to simultaneously characterize lipids at multiple isomer levels. Anodic corrosion of cobalt and copper in the positive ion mode generates the metal-adducted lipid complexes, [M+Co]2+ and [M+Cu]+, respectively. Optimization of parameters such as the distances of the electrodes from the nESI tip allowed the achievement of the formation of one metal-adducted lipid product at a time. Collision-induced dissociation (CID) of [M+Co]2+ results in preferential loss of the fatty acyl (FA) chain at the sn-2 position, thus generating singly charged sn-specific fragment ions. Whereas, multistage fragmentation of [M+Cu]+ via CID generated a C=C bond position-specific characteristic ion pattern induced by the \u03c0-Cu+ interaction. The feasibility of the method was tested on PC lipid extract from egg yolk to identify lipids on multiple isomer levels. Thus, the application of dual metal anodic corrosion allows lipid isomer identification with reduced sample preparation time, no signal suppression by counter anions, low sample consumption and no need for an extra apparatus.</p>",
