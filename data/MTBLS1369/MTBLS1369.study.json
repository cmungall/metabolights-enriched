                "description": "<p>Here we present LipidCreator, a software that fully supports targeted lipidomics assay development. LipidCreator offers a comprehensive framework to compute MS/MS fragment masses for over 60 lipid classes. LipidCreator provides all functionalities needed to define fragments, manage stable isotope labeling, optimize collision energy and generate in silico spectral libraries. We validate LipidCreator assays computationally and analytically and prove that it is capable to generate large targeted experiments to analyze blood and to dissect lipid-signaling pathways such as in human platelets.</p><p><br></p><p>In MTBLS1369, to validate the performance and accuracy of the transition lists provided by LipidCreator and their applicabability on other MS platforms, we used the transition lists for targeted profiling of phospho- and glycerolipids in human platelet material. Platelets were stimulated with 0.01 U/ml thrombin, 1 U/ml thrombin, 1 \u00b5g/ml CRP or 5 \u00b5g/ml CRP for 5 min. The MS profiling of unstimulated and stimulated platelet material was performed after HPLC separation on a Q-Exactive HF (Thermo Scientific, Bremen, Germany) in positive and negative mode, based on scheduled PRM. Samples were measured in triplicates, interspersed with blank / buffer and standard runs.</p><p><br></p><p>Studies linked to this manuscript include;</p><p><a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/mtbls1333' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>MTBLS1333; LipidCreator: Collision Energy Optimization and Fragment Intensity Prediction for Lipid Mediators - Thermo QExactive HF</a></p><p><a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/mtbls1334' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>MTBLS1334; LipidCreator: Collision Energy Optimization and Fragment Intensity Prediction for Lipid Mediators - Agilent QTof</a></p><p><a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/mtbls1369' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>MTBLS1369; LipidCreator: Platelet isolation and stimulation - Targeted Phospho- and Glycerolipid Profiling</a></p><p><a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/mtbls1375' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>MTBLS1375; LipidCreator: Targeted lipidomics analysis of Human Plasma samples and comparison with NIST SRM 1950 standard</a></p><p><a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/mtbls1376' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>MTBLS1376; LipidCreator: Targeted lipidomics analysis of S. cerevisiae to determine true and false identification</a></p><p><a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/mtbls1381' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>MTBLS1381; LipidCreator: Platelet isolation and stimulation - Targeted Lipid Mediator Profiling</a></p><p><a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/editor/study/MTBLS1382' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>MTBLS1382; LipidCreator: Platelet isolation and stimulation - DIA Li</a><a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/mtbls1382' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>pid Mediator Validation</a></p>",

The dried lipid extract was re-suspended in 100&nbsp;\u00b5l of IPA/MeOH/CHCl3 (4:2:1, v/v/v) for further MS analysis. The lower layer was used to precipitate proteins by adding 903&nbsp;\u00b5l MeOH after removing the interphase and samples were stored at -80&nbsp;\u00b0C for 3&nbsp;hrs in order to perform protein precipitation.
