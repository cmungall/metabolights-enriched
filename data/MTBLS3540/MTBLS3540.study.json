                "description": "<p>Enterotoxigenic <em>Escherichia coli</em> (ETEC) is a major cause of diarrhea in children and adults in endemic areas. Gene regulation of ETEC during growth <em>in vitro</em> and <em>in vivo</em> needs to be further evaluated, and here we describe the full transcriptome and metabolome of ETEC during growth from mid-logarithmic growth to early stationary phase in rich medium (LB medium). We identified specific genes and pathways subjected to rapid transient alterations in gene expression and metabolite production during the transition from logarithmic to stationary growth. The transient phase was found to be different from the subsequent induction of early stationary phase-induced genes. The transient phase was characterized by the repression of genes and metabolites involved in organic substance transport. Genes involved in fucose and putrescine metabolism were upregulated, and genes involved in iron transport were repressed. Expression of toxins and colonization factors were not changed, suggesting retained virulence from mid-logarithmic to the start of the stationary phase. Metabolomic analyses showed that the transient phase was characterized by a drop of intracellular amino acids, e.g., L-tyrosine, L-tryptophan, L-phenylalanine, L-leucine and L-glutamic acid, followed by increased levels at induction of stationary phase. A pathway enrichment analysis of the entire combined transcriptome and metabolome revealed that significant pathways during progression from logarithmic to early stationary phase are involved in the degradation of neurotransmitters aminobutyrate (GABA) and precursors of 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin). This work provides a comprehensive framework for further studies on transcriptional and metabolic regulation in pathogenic <em>E. coli</em>.</p>",

The whole-genome sequences of the two strains are available<strong>[3]</strong>, including a complete assembled chromosome and two plasmids of 142 and 78 kbp, respectively, for E2265<strong>[4][2]</strong>. Bacteria from frozen stock vials were grown on blood plates, and 10 colonies were picked and grown under shaking conditions in 10 mL of LB medium to OD600 = 0.8 (10^9 bacteria/mL) to be used as a starting culture. The starting culture was diluted 100-fold in 20 mL LB medium in a 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask and grown aerated at 150 rpm rotation at 37 \u00b0C. Samples for optical density, CFU and RNA extraction and metabolomics were withdrawn after 3, 4 and 5 h. The track dilution method was performed for bacterial enumeration as described previously<strong>[5]</strong>. In brief, a 20 mL of bacterial culture was collected every hour up to 6 h and overnight timepoint and subjected to 10-fold serial dilution in a 96-well plate filled with 180 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) 1x. Then, 10 mL from each dilution were spotted in a column onto LB agar plates, and the plate was tipped onto its side to allow migration of the spots across the agar surface. This step was performed in duplicate. LB plates were incubated overnight at 37 \u00b0C, and CFU per mL was quantified by multiplying the number of colonies of each tract by their respective dilution factor and inoculated volume (0.01 mL).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Untargeted metabolomics</strong></p><p>The bacterial sampling for metabolomics was performed as described previously<strong>[6]</strong> with some modifications. A total of 4 mL of bacterial culture in triplicates were collected, and each culture was split into 2 sterile Eppendorf tubes to sample intracellular and secreted metabolites at every timepoint. In addition, another 100 mL were collected to measure the optical density and pH. For extracellular metabolites, 2 mL of bacterial culture was pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000 x g for 3 min a tabletop centrifuge, and the supernatants were carefully removed and transferred to a new sterile Eppendorf tube for snap-frizzing in liquid nitrogen. Snap frozen samples were stored at -80 \u00b0C. The fast filtration method was applied for intracellular metabolites using a 3-place EZ-FitTM Manifold (Millipore) connected to a single vacuum that supports simultaneous filtration of three samples. A sterile 22-mm diameter MF-Millipore membrane filter with 0.45-mm pore size was placed onto each manifold, pre-washed with pre-warmed LB medium and the vacuum set to 50 mbar. Then, 2 mL of the bacterial culture were pipetted in the middle of the filter and subsequently perfused with 5 mL of pre-warmed washing buffer (M9 medium [Sigma-Aldrich] adjusted to pH 7.3) was perfused. Immediately after, the cell-loaded filter was removed and transferred to an Eppendorf tube for snap-freezing in liquid nitrogen. Next, 2 mL aliquots of LB and M9 minimal medium (Sigma-Aldrich) were collected and span-frizzed and used as negative controls. All tubes were kept at -80 \u00b0C and shipped in dry ice to the Science for Life Laboratory at Uppsala University for metabolite extraction and UPLC-MS analysis.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Nicklasson M, Sj\u00f6ling \u00c5, von Mentzer A, Qadri F, Svennerholm AM.

Mass spectrometric analysis was performed on an Acquity UPLC system connected to a Synapt G2 Q-TOF mass spectrometer, both from Waters Corporation (Milford, MA, USA). The system was controlled using the <strong>MassLynx</strong> software (v 4.1) also from Waters Corporation. The separation was performed on an Acquity UPLC HSS T3 column (1.8 \u03bcm, 100 x 2.1 mm) from Waters Corporation. The mobile phase consisted of 0.1% formic acid in MilliQ water (A) and 0.1% formic acid in LC-MS grade methanol (B). The column temperature was 40 \u00b0C and the mobile phase gradient applied was as follows: 0.0-2.0 min, 0% B; 2.0-15.0 min, 0-100% B; 15.0-18.0 min, 100% B; 18.0-20.0 min, 100-0% B; 20.0-25.0 min, 0% B, with a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min.</p>",
