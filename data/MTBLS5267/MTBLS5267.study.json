                "description": "<p><strong>OBJECTIVES:</strong> High activity of Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase1 (IDO1) in lung cancer patients converts tryptophan (Trp), which is the essential amino acid for T cell metabolism, to kynurenine (Kyn) and consequently suppresses anti-tumor immune responses. We aimed to track the dynamics of IDO1 activity in stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who received first-line radiotherapy (RT) and explore its association with survival outcomes.</p><p><strong>MATERIALS AND METHODS:</strong> Systemic IDO1 activity was calculated by Kyn:Trp ratio. Plasma levels of Kyn and Trp in 113 thoracic RT-received stage III NSCLC patients were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography before the initiation of RT. Dynamic change of IDO1 activity was followed in 24 patients by measuring Kyn:Trp ratio before, during and after RT administration.</p><p><strong>RESULTS:</strong> In 24 patients with dynamic tracking of plasma IDO1 activity, there was no significant alterations observed among the 3 time points (Friedman test, p=0.13). The changing pattern of Kyn:Trp ratio was divided into 4 groups: decreased consistently during RT, first increased then decreased, increased consistently, first decreased then increased. Patients whose Kyn:Trp ratio kept decreasing or first increased then decreased were defined as good-change group. The good-change status was identified as an independent positive factor for overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) (p=0.04; p=0.01) in multivariate analysis among evaluated parameters. Patients with good change showed significantly superior local control than bad-change group (p=0.01, HR=0.22). In 113 stage III NSCLC patients with pre-radiation Kyn:Trp ratio, a trend that high baseline IDO1 activity was associated with short OS was observed (p=0.079).</p><p><strong>CONCLUSION: </strong>Favorable change of IDO1 activity during RT was associated with superior OS, PFS and local control. IDO1 activity is a promising biomarker for prognosis in stage III NSCLC patients.</p>",

All patients provided written informed consent before therapy. Patients who were pathologically diagnosed with unresectable stage III NSCLC as per the American Joint Committee of Cancer (AJCC) 8th edition cancer staging manual between January 2013 and December 2017 at our institution were prospectively included. All patients underwent thoracic intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). X-rays at 6 MV were used, with a median total dose of 60 Gy (28-67 Gy) in 30(13-33) fractions. Etoposide/cisplatin and paclitaxel/carboplatin regimen were primarily used in concurrent CRT or sequential CRT. Patients were evaluated weekly during the course of RT and followed up 1 month after the last irradiation and then every 3 months for 2 years, and then every 6 months for another 3 years. Routinely follow-up included blood test, computed tomography (CT) of the chest and abdomen (enhanced requested if without contraindications), bone scan and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The median follow-up time was 63.0 months.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Sample and clinical data collection </strong></p><p>The plasma of patients (5 mL) was collected before the initiation of RT, 4 weeks after RT initiation, right after the completion of RT and stored at -80 \u00b0C. At the end of the follow-up, 24 patients with dynamic monitoring at the 3 timepoints and 89 patients with pre-RT plasma were included. Clinical data including age, gender, smoking, histology, clinical stage, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status Scale (ECOG-PS), biologically effective dose (BED) and treatment patterns were collected. The plasma Trp and Kyn were quantified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method. LC-MS/MS analysis was conducted by Minzu University of China, China.</p>",
