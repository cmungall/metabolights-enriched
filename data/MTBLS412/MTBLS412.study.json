                "description": "In order to analyze HUVECs under normoxia and hypoxia, cells were initially deprived of excess nutrients and hormones by maintaining them overnight in a restricted medium with only 2% fetal bovine serum, and incubated for 40 hours in the presence of the tracer [1,2-13C2]-glucose until sample collection. 13C propagation from labelled glucose to glycogen, RNA ribose, lactate and glutamate was measured. The resulting isotopologue distributions are provided for three biological replicates per metabolite. In order to correct the natural abundance effect and also the effect of possible interferences among different compounds, isotopologue distributions in biological samples without labelled glucose are provided for RNA ribose, lactate and glutamate. Also, isotopologue distributions for commercial glucose are provided, using commercial glucose as a reference compound to correct the natural abundance effect in samples for glycogen (glucose) analysis. Finally, additional results are provided with measured glucose uptake, glutamine uptake, glutamate secretion, lactate secretion and net re-utilization of glycogen.",

On the one hand, media and cell pellets were used for analysing isotopologue abundances. Thus, media samples for isotopologue abundances in glucose, lactate and glutamate and cell culture pellets for analysing isotopologue distribution patterns in RNA ribose and glycogen. Accordingly, for glucose, lactate, glutamate, RNA ribose and glycogen the following protocols were applied:\n</p>\n1) Glucose from cell culture media was isolated using a tandem Dowex column containing Dowex-1X8/Dowex-50WX8 ion-exchange columns by eluting the metabolite with water. The liquid collected from elution was evaporated to dryness with air flow, overnight.\n</p>\n2) For lactate, first HCl was added to the cell culture media and the lactic acid formed was extracted with ethyl acetate and the mixture evaporated to dryness under N2 gas flow.\n</p>\n3) For glutamate, the cell culture medium was first passed through a Dowex-50WX8 column and then the amino acids in the Dowex mesh were eluted with 2N ammonium hydroxide and collected in glass tubes and were then dried under airflow overnight.\n</p>\n4) For ribose, cells generated for RNA-ribose 13C-tracer assays were trypsinized and counted using a ScepterTM Handheld Automated Cell Counter (Merck Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), and both cell pellets and media were kept frozen (at -80 \u00b0C and -20 \u00b0C, respectively) for further processing. Fresh or frozen plates were processed for RNA isolation using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). The Trizol lysates were mixed with chloroform and centrifuged in RNAase-free eppendorfs so that they would separate into organic and aqueous phases. The aqueous phase was carefully collected into another RNAase-free eppendorf containing cold isopropanol and then centrifuged at 12000 x g for 15 min at 4 \u00b0C in order to precipitate RNA. The supernatant was removed and the pellet was washed with 75% cold ethanol several times, before being dried and resuspended in RNAase-free water. The purified RNA was then hydrolysed in 2 ml of 2N HCl at 100 \u00b0C for 2 hr and the solution was evaporated to dryness under airflow overnight.\n</p>\n5) For glycogen, the plates of cell cultures, after the experiment, were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, scrapped with 0.1 M NaOH and heated to 100 \u00b0C for 15 min for protein denaturation.\n</p>\nThe samples were then sonicated for 5 min 2-3x using an ultrasonic bath (Branson 200 Ultrasonic Cleaner, Emerson Industrial Automation, St Louis, MO, USA). The pH of the samples was adjusted to pH 6-7 and then a fixed quantity of [U-13C-D7]-glucose was added as an internal standard for all them, which was used for quantifying the glycogen content. Then 200 \u00b5l of 1.25 mg/ml amyloglucosidase in 0.4 M acetate buffer was added to digest the glycogen and the mixture was incubated overnight at 37 \u00b0C under agitation. Then both the glucose released from glycogen and the glucose internal standard were isolated using Dowex-1X8/Dowex-50WX8 ion-exchange columns, eluting with water. The eluted samples were then dried overnight under airflow.\n</p>\nGlucose, lactate, glutamate, ribose and glycogen, media and pellets were also used to directly estimate rates of transport and transformation. Media were used for estimation of secretion or uptake rates of glucose, glutamine, glutamate and lactate among cells and media. In addition, a net rate of glycogen re-utilization into glucose units by cells was observed and estimated. All these rates were calculated by quantifying metabolite concentrations and glycogen at initial and final time points, and normalizing with respect to both cell numbers and incubation time (hr). Concentrations of extracellular metabolites glucose, lactate, glutamine and glutamate were quantified from cell culture media using COBAS MIRA plus spectral analyzer (Horiba ABX, Japan), by monitoring at 340 nm wavelength the production of NADPH in specific reactions involving the respective metabolites. For quantification of glycogen content, a fixed quantity of [U-13C-D7]-glucose was added as an internal standard as explained above, for calibration purposes and the glycogen content estimated using the calculated curve was normalized with protein content. The resulting rates expressed in \u00b5M of metabolite consumed/produced/transformed per hr per million cells (mol/hr/million-cells) were 0.282, 0.235, 0.061 and 1.558 (normoxia), and 0.463, 0.099, 0.050 and 1.169 (hypoxia), for glucose uptake, glutamine uptake, glutamate secretion, and lactate secretion, respectively, with a net transformation of glycogen of 0.00119 (normoxia) and 0.000175 (hypoxia).",

The RT of the chromatographic peak was 3.9 min. Ions were monitored by SIM recording the ion abundance of C2-C5 fragment in 197-203 m/z.\n</p>\n4) For ribose, the GC/MS analysis was carried out under chemical ionisation mode (Scan polarity: positive). Samples were injected at 250 \u00b0C and the oven temperature was programmed as: 150 \u00b0C for 1 min, increase to 275 \u00b0C at the rate of 15 \u00b0C/min and then to 300 \u00b0C at the rate of 40 \u00b0C/min. The RT of the chromatographic peak was 5.3 min. Ions were monitored by SIM recording the ion abundance of C1-C5 molecule in the range of 255-262 m/z.\n</p>\n5) For glycogen, the GC/MS analysis was carried out under chemical ionisation mode (Scan polarity: positive). Sample injection, oven temperature and RT parameters were similar to that of glucose. Ions were monitored by SIM recording the ion abundance for C1-C6 glucose in the range of 327-334 m/z and of [U-13C-D7]-glucose in the range of 339-345 m/z. The resulting MS spectral data showed the distribution of ions of a compound or a fragment with a specific m/z value. Monitoring such specific m/z values for the ion distributions in each metabolite will give us the fractional distribution of the artificially introduced 13C. The peak areas for all the ions in the cluster were integrated and extracted from the generated raw data (CDF files) using the MSD5975C Data Analysis (Agilent technologies) software. Each peak area is a signal intensity that corresponds to the fraction of ions within the ion cluster under analysis.",

In order to distinguish the known, artificially introduced labels, isotopes contaminating from other modes described above must be subtracted. This kind of label correction is carried out using the R-based program Midcor. The resulting data corrects for the unwanted isotope enrichments mentioned above and gives only the enrichment due to the 13C atoms from the precursor tracer introduced in our experiment. The final data are represented as fractional isotopologue distribution designated as m0, m1, m2,.. etc. where the number indicates the corrected labelled carbons (13C). The sum of all the isotopologues of the ion clusters is equal to 1 (or 100%) and the total 13C enrichment is calculated as 1 (or 100%) minus m0. The abundance of the m2 isotopologue of glucose ([1,2-13C2]-glucose) was estimated to be 48.5% and 48% in normoxia and hypoxia, respectively.",
