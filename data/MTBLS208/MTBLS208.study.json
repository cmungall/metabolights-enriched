                "description": "<p>Drastic alteration in macronutrients causes large changes in gene expression in the photosynthetic unicellular alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Preliminary data suggested that cells follow a biphasic response to this change hinging on the initiation of lipid accumulation, and we hypothesized that drastic repatterning of metabolism also followed this biphasic modality. To test this hypothesis, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolite changes that occur under nitrogen (N) deprivation were analyzed. Eight sampling times were selected covering the progressive slowing of growth and induction of oil synthesis between 4 and 6&nbsp;h after N deprivation. Results of the combined, systems-level investigation indicated that C.&nbsp;reinhardtii cells sense and respond on a large scale within 30&nbsp;min to a switch to N-deprived conditions turning on a largely gluconeogenic metabolic state, which then transitions to a glycolytic stage between 4 and 6&nbsp;h after N depletion. This nitrogen-sensing system is transduced to carbon- and nitrogen-responsive pathways, leading to down-regulation of carbon assimilation and chlorophyll biosynthesis, and an increase in nitrogen metabolism and lipid biosynthesis. For example, the expression of nearly all the enzymes for assimilating nitrogen from ammonium, nitrate, nitrite, urea, formamide/acetamide, purines, pyrimidines, polyamines, amino acids and proteins increased significantly. Although arginine biosynthesis enzymes were also rapidly up-regulated, arginine pool size changes and isotopic labeling results indicated no increased flux through this pathway.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Data availability:</strong></p><p>The proteomics data have been deposited into the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository with the data set identifier <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD002377' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>PXD002377</a>.</p>",

The cells were cultured in Tris acetate phosphate (TAP) medium containing 5 mM ammonium chloride as N source at 22 \u00b0C under constant illumination with cool-white fluorescent bulbs at an illumination of 80 \u00b5mol photons/m^2/s and with continuous shaking at 150 rpm. Single colonies were used to inoculate a pre-culture in a shake flask plugged with a sponge to allow aeration. This culture was harvested at mid-exponential phase and used to inoculate a new culture at a starting density of around 0.1 OD750, which corresponds to a cell dry weight of 0.05 mg/ml. The cells were cultured continuously in a volume of 1 l in a 5 l conical flask by serial dilution, not allowing the cell density to exceed 0.4 OD750. The cells were adapted to this environment by at least three serial dilutions corresponding to more than 5 doublings. The culture volume was always equal to or less than one fifth of the flask. This along with the low cell density ensured that the cultures had consistent illumination without significant shading and that the cells remain in a metabolic steady state (confirmed by steady state 13C labelling patterns).\n</p>\nAfter the cells had been adapted to the above conditions, the culture was split in two and harvested by centrifugation (5000 x g for 2 min). One half of the centrifuged cells were washed with acetate-free TAP media and re-suspended in 2 l of fresh TAP media (containing acetate). The remaining cells were washed with acetate free Tris phosphate media without nitrogen source (N-) and re-suspended in 2 l TAP media (with acetate, without N). The cells from each treatment were divided into seven 1 l conical flasks with a culture volume of 200 ml and then allowed to grow under the same conditions described above. The culture was divided into four 50 mL conical tubes and centrifuged immediately at 5000 x g for 2 min at 0 \u00baC for the zero hr time point. Three of the centrifuged pellets were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -70 \u00baC. The total time from harvest to freezing took less than 10 min. One of the stored pellets was shipped on dry ice for metabolite analysis and another was shipped on dry ice for proteomic analysis. To the fourth pellet, 1 ml of the RNA stabilization reagent, RNAlater (Ambion Life Technologies), was added and then frozen in liquid nitrogen for storage at -70 \u00baC. This sample was sent on dry ice for transcriptome analysis by RNA-seq.\n</p>\nThe 7 flasks being grown simultaneously were harvested successively after 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 12 and 24 hr. The culturing and collection process was repeated on four separate occasions (different weeks), to yield four biological replicates. The amount of cells harvested per sample was always more than 4 mg dry weight equivalent.",

Centrifuge tubes containing the solution during harvest were cooled in a pre-chilled cooling box to keep sample temperature below -20 \u00b0C. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 16,100 rcf for 2 min with the centrifuge and rotor cooled at -20 \u00b0C. Supernatant was decanted and residual liquid carefully removed. The pellet was flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and lyophilized at -50 \u00b0C in a 2 ml round bottom Eppendorf tube. Lyophilized cells were disrupted using the ball mill MM 301 (Retsch GmbH & Co., Germany) in two variants for 3 min: (a) using 0.5 ml of glass beads (500 \u00b5m i.d., Sigma, St.Louis MO) concomitant with 0.5 ml extraction solvent and (b) using a single 5 mm i.d. steel ball, followed by the addition of 0.5 ml extraction solvent and vortexing. After 2 min centrifugation at 16,100 rcf, the supernatants were removed (200 \u00b5l for the glass bead method, 350 \u00b5l for the steel ball method) followed by a secondary extraction step using an additional 800 \u00b5l extraction solvent, centrifugation and adding the supernatant (700 \u00b5l for the glass bead method) to the first aliquot. Hence, for both methods the same fraction of extraction solvent was used (70% of total extraction volume). 5 different extraction solvent system (methanol:isopropanol:water (5:2:2)) was used. Extracts were concentrated to dryness in a vacuum concentrator. Dried extracts were kept at -80 \u00b0C for up to 4 wks before derivatization and analysis by GC-TOF mass spectrometry.",
