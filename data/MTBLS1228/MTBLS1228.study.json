                "description": "Premature infants require oxygen supplementation to survive, but excess oxygen causes retinovascular growth suppression that underlies the leading cause of infant blindness known as retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). We analyzed changes in intermediary metabolism during hyperoxia in human retinal endothelial cells (RECs) and human retinal M\u00fcller glia, which coexist through glutamine consumption and production, respectively. Using a stable isotope labeling technique in human RECs and human M\u00fcller cells in culture, here we show that M\u00fcller cells in hyperoxia block entry of glycolytic carbon into the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and instead oxidize glutamine. In hyperoxia, catabolism of glutamine increased ammonium release by 2-fold. Hyperoxia induces glutamine-fueled anaplerosis that reverses basal M\u00fcller cell metabolism from production to consumption of glutamine.\n\n ",

Dissected retinas were minced and transferred to a collection tube with minimal volume of dissecting medium, held on ice. Retinal tissue was dissociated using the Worthington Papain Dissociation System ( LK003150). Briefly, a vial of papain was reconstituted in EBSS equilibrated with sterile 95% O2 : 5% CO2 and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 10 mins until fully dissolved. A vial of DNase I was reconstituted in equilibrated EBSS, and 250 \u03bcl was added to the activated papain. This papain/DNase solution was added to the retinal tissue and triturated gently with P1000 pipette. The tissues were equilibrated in sterile 95% O2 : 5% CO2 and incubated at 37 \u00b0C with 160 rpm agitation for a total of 35 mins, broken up into 15 min, 15 min, and 5 min incubations, triturating gently after each. The cell suspension was centrifuged at 550 x g for 5 mins at room temperature and pellet resuspended in ovomucoid inhibitor solution, prepared according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.

After 48 h of incubation in hyperoxia, 400 \u03bcl of media sample was taken and added to 400 \u03bcl of (10)N NaOH in 1.5 ml tube. To this preparation, 400 \u03bcl of formaldehyde (36.5-38% in water) was added and left overnight at room temperature in the fume hood. Formaldehyde reacts with ammonium to produce a stable compound hexamethylenetetramine (HMT). To this HMT preparation, 200 \u03bcl of 10% iodine was added to form the extractible HMT-iodine adduct. Tubes were incubated on a thermomixer at 40 \u00b0C for 15 min with 1000 rpm agitation speed. Tubes were cooled down to room temperature and whole mixture was added to 5 ml of chloroform, to extract HMT-iodine from the solution. Tubes were centrifuged at 1000 x g at room temperature for 1 min to separate phases. Lower phase (100 \u03bcl) containing HMT-iodine was taken out into fresh tube and 1 \u03bcl of alkanes mix (C10-C40 50 mg/l, even chain alkanes) standard was added to the solution as internal standard. Each sample (1 \u03bcl) was then injected into the mass spec and m/z 140 corresponding to mass of HMT was used for quantitation and was normalized to one of the alkanes in the spiked alkanes internal standard with m/z 198, which corresponds to mass of C14H30.</p><p><br></p><p>References:</p><p>[1] Yang D, Puchowicz MA, David F, Powers L, Halperin ML, Brunengraber H. 15N enrichment of ammonium, glutamine-amide and urea, measured via mass isotopomer analysis of hexamethylenetetramine.

Samples were measured in a constant flow mode with flow of helium set to 1.1 ml/min. Oven was set to a starting temperature of 60 \u00b0C for 1 min and then ramped at 10 \u00b0C/min to a final temperature of 325 \u00b0C with a final hold time of 10 min. Column was re-equilibrated at 60 \u00b0C for 1 min.</p><p>Primary M\u00fcller and astrocyte metabolites were measured separately using the DB-5ms GC Column 30 m x 0.25 mm x 0.25 \u03bcm with DuraGuard 10 m. Scan method was similar with solvent delay of 6.6 min. For glutamine labelling assays, SIM method was used, also with solvent delay of 6.6 min. Ions used in SIM method were same&nbsp;with different time windows to account for differences in retention time on new column.</p>",
