                "description": "<p>System-wide metabolic homeostasis is crucial for maintaining physiological functions of living organisms. Stable-isotope tracing metabolomics allows to unravel metabolic activity quantitatively by measuring the isotopically labeled metabolites, but has been largely restricted by coverage. Yet, delineating system-wide metabolic homeostasis at the whole-organism level remains non-trivial. Here, we develop a global isotope tracing metabolomics technology to measure labeled metabolites with a metabolome-wide coverage. Using Drosophila as an aging model organism, we probe the in vivo tracing kinetics with quantitative information on labeling patterns, extents and rates on a metabolome-wide scale. We curate a system-wide metabolic network to characterize metabolic homeostasis and disclose a system-wide loss of metabolic coordinations that impacts both intra- and inter-tissue metabolic homeostasis significantly during Drosophila aging. Importantly, we reveal an unappreciated metabolic diversion from glycolysis to serine metabolism and purine metabolism as Drosophila aging. The developed technology facilitates a system-level understanding of metabolic regulation in living organisms.</p>",

When cells were grown to 80% confluence, unlabeled DMEM was removed. Cells were washed using ~3 ml of PBS. The culture medium was replaced as glucose-free and glutamine-free DMEM containing 25 mM [U-13C]-glucose, 4 mM [U-13C]-glutamine, 5 mM [U-13C]-acetate and 10% dialyzed FBS.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Fly tissue samples:</strong></p><p>The fly culture and stable-isotope labeling experiments followed our previous publications<strong>[1]</strong>. In brief, flies were cultured in standard media at 25 \u00b0C with 60% humidity in a 12 h light and 12 h dark cycle. The standard Drosophila food contains sucrose (36 g/l), maltose (38 g/l), yeast (22.5 g/l), agar (5.4 g/l), maizena (60 g/l), soybean flour (8.25 g/l), sodium benzoate (0.9 g/l), methyl-p-hydroxybenzoate (0.225 g/l), propionic acid (6.18 ml/l), and H2O to make up 1 L of the food. The wild type fly line used was 5905 (FlyBase ID FBst0005905, w1118). To age flies, adult male flies were collected at the day of eclosion and maintained at 20 flies per vial at 25 \u00b0C with 60% humidity and a 12 h light and 12 h dark cycle. Aged flies were transferred to new vials every other day. For isotope tracing study, male flies at ages of 3 d and 30 d were used with 15 flies per vial. Prior to isotope labeling, flies were starved for 6 h, then transferred to new vials containing a small piece of Kimwipe paper pre-soaked in 800 \u03bcl of 10% [U-13C]-glucose. When the desired time points (0, 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h) were reached, the flies were dissected under CO2 anesthesia. It took about 15-20 s to dissect a fly. The whole muscle tissues and whole head tissues were collected from flies. Head or muscle tissues from 15 flies were pooled into 1 microcentrifuge tube as 1 biological replicate. After dissection, the tissue samples were quickly frozen using liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 \u00b0C. The pooled sample was used as 1 biologically independent replicate. For each condition, 10 biologically independent replicates were prepared. The metabolic heterogeneity was confirmed similar between 3 d and 30 d flies (see <strong>Figure S16</strong> in the paper associated with this study). The raw data of validation experiment with PRC2 mutants was retrieved from our previous study<strong>[2]</strong>. PRC2 mutation is referred to mutations to genes in the Polycomb repressive complex 2. The genotype of PRC2 mutant was Pcl c421/+; Su(z)12 c253/+. 3 groups of flies (WT 8 d, WT 30 d, PRC2 mutant 30 d) were included in data re-analysis and there were 8 biologically independent replicates in each group.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Cai Y, Liu N, Zhu ZJ.

LC-MS data acquisition was operated under information-dependent acquisition (IDA) mode. The instrument was set to acquire over the m/z range 60-1200 Da for TOF MS scan and the m/z range 25-1200 Da for product ion scan. Collision energy for product ion scan was 30 eV or -30 eV in positive or negative modes, respectively, while collision energy spread (CES) was 0 eV. The accumulation time for TOF MS scan was set at 150 ms per spectrum and product ion scan at 30 ms per spectrum. The unit resolution was selected for precursor ion selection. IDA settings were set as followings: charge state 1 to 1, intensity 100 cps, exclude isotopes within 4 Da, mass tolerance 10 ppm, and maximum number of candidate ions 12. The 'exclude former target ions' was set as 4 s after 2 occurrences. In IDA advanced tab, 'dynamic background subtraction' was chosen.</p>",

The metabolite annotation parameters were set as '<strong>HILIC</strong>' for liquid chromatography mode, '<strong>Sciex TripleTOF</strong>' according to instrument platform, and \u201c<strong>30</strong>\u201d or \u201c<strong>SNCE_20_30_40%</strong>\u201d for collision energy.

For 293T cells samples acquired on TripleTOF 6600, a total of 1,347 metabolites were annotated, including 215, 219 and 913 metabolites with annotation MSI level 1, 2 and 3, respectively.

For fly muscle samples, a total of 1290 metabolites were annotated, and 117, 102 and 1071 metabolites were annotated as MSI level 1, 2, and 3, respectively.
