                "description": "<p>Bibenzyls are a specialized metabolite class found throughout the plant kingdom. One of the most prolific producers of bibenzyls are liverworts, specifically plants of the <em>Radula</em> genera. These plants possess an incredible diversity of bibenzyls, prenylated bibenzyls and a few (bis)bibenzyls, several of which have medicinal properties, including perrottetinene, an analog of tetrahydrocannabinol from cannabis. To provide insight into the bibenzyls\u2019 biosynthesis <em>in planta</em>, exogenous phytohormones were applied to <em>in vitro</em> grown <em>Radula complanata</em> and bibenzyl metabolite production was monitored with targeted and untargeted metabolomics. The targeted metabolomic analysis of six prenylated bibenzyls revealed that production of these metabolites was largely reduced when plants were treated with abscisic acid (AA), salicylic acid (SA), 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) or 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP). The reduction of these metabolites in the BAP and NAA treatment suggests that prenylated bibenzyl production is negatively correlated with vegetative plant growth. The reduction of bibenzyls at low AA and SA concentrations and mild increase at higher AA and SA concentrations suggest that their production is regulated by these stress hormones. In addition, six other bibenzyl metabolites were tentatively identified from the untargeted analysis. These results provide insight into the influence of phytohormones on the bioactive bibenzyl content of <em>R. complanata</em>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Untargeted metabolomics</strong>&nbsp;is reported in the current study&nbsp;<a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS3563' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS3563</strong></a>.</p><p><strong>Targeted metabolomics</strong>&nbsp;is reported in <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS4321' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS4321</strong></a>.</p>",

Mature spore capsules were harvested from environmental samples collected in New Brunswick, Canada, and surface sterilized in 10% bleach for 5 min. Voucher specimens of environmental samples used for spore collection have been deposited at the Connell Memorial Herbarium at the University of New Brunswick, Fredericton, under the accession numbers 69083 and 69084. Sterilized capsules were rinsed 3x with sterile water, gently crushed with tweezers and placed on 20-20-20+1% glucose agar plates until germination. Plates were placed near an east-facing window and incubated at ambient temperature. After 4 months, mature gametophytes were placed on 20-20-20 agar plates. If contamination was observed, plantlets were transferred to clean 20-20-20 plates until use.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Plants were placed on 20 mL of 20-20-20 agar plates that were supplemented with hormones and grown under full spectrum growth lights (LED Grow Light, TOLYS). Plates were placed 1.19 m below the lights and grown under a 14 h day/night cycle at ambient laboratory temperatures (approximately 20-25 \u00b0C). Hormone treatments were conducted in 2 groups: growth and stress. Stress-response hormones included methyl jasmonate (JA, Sigma), abscisic acid (AA, Sigma) and salicylic acid (SA, Sigma)&nbsp;while growth hormones included 1-napthaleneaceticacid (NAA, Sigma), and 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP, Sigma). A 10 mM methanolic solution of each hormone was prepared and added to the cooled agar stock before pouring to make a 1, 10 and 100 \u00b5M treatment for each hormone.&nbsp;Control samples (no methanol, no hormones) were prepared for both the stress-response and growth groups. The stress-response hormones were grown for 4 months while the growth hormone treatments were grown for 3 months. After growing[rew4], plants were harvested and weighed individually before being transferred to -80 \u00b0C until further processing. Harvesting yielded the following samples: AA1, AA10, AA100, JA1, JA10, JA100, SA1, SA10, SA100, Stress Control, BAP1, BAP10, BAP100, NAA1, NAA10, NAA100, Growth Control.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Pollock MA, Oppenheimer DG.

Parameter optimization with IPO<strong>[3]</strong> was conducted and additional manual adjustments were made based on instrument knowledge. Data was restricted to 0 to 1020 s and the centWave algorithm was applied for peak detection<strong>[4]</strong>. The following parameters were utilized for negative mode data: ppm=13, mzCenterFun='mean', peakwidth=c(4, 33), prefilter=c(4, 200), mzdiff=0.0023, snthresh=11, noise=0, integrate=1, firstBaselineCheck=TRUE, verboseColumns=TRUE, fitgauss=FALSE. For positive mode data, the following parameters were utilized: ppm=32, mzCenterFun='mean', peakwidth=c(4, 32), prefilter=c(2, 100), mzdiff=0.0111, snthresh=8, noise=0, integrate=1, firstBaselineCheck=TRUE, verboseColumns=FALSE, fitgauss=FALSE. Grouping parameters were as follows: minFraction=0.7, bw=22 (positive), bw=2.5 (negative). Grouped peaks were retention time corrected using the adjustRtime function in XCMS with the following parameters: minFraction=0.7, smooth=loess, span=0.2, family=gaussian. After retention time correction, samples were regrouped using the previous parameters and peaks were filled with the fillChromPeaks function in XCMS with the following parameters: fixedRt=0, expandRt=5<strong>[5]</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p>To assess the quality of the obtained spectral data, EICs for the 3 internal standards and 6 previously identified bibenzyls were extracted and manually analyzed for peak shape and retention time shifts. After an initial quality check of the data, positive and negative data sets were processed independently and merged into one feature table once features were detected and annotated. Several tables were constructed from the original feature table based on various constraints. A presence/absence table was constructed to determine if a peak was present in the MS1 data and a cut-off at 0.01% of the max peak intensity was applied. A table containing features that were only present in each treatment and a compound table containing only features for which there were MS2 spectra available was constructed. In preparation for compound identification, missing MS1 data was replaced with the median intensity value and the matrix was log transformed. After transformation, useable MS2 spectra were extracted from MS1 spectra, imported to SIRIUS v 4.9.6 GUI and the molecular formula was determined.</p><p><br></p><p>Repo for data analyses - https://zenodo.org/record/7581479.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Chambers MC, Maclean B, Burke R, Amodei D, Ruderman DL, Neumann S, Gatto L, Fischer B, Pratt B, Egertson J, Hoff K, Kessner D, Tasman N, Shulman N, Frewen B, Baker TA, Brusniak MY, Paulse C, Creasy D, Flashner L, Kani K, Moulding C, Seymour SL, Nuwaysir LM, Lefebvre B, Kuhlmann F, Roark J, Rainer P, Detlev S, Hemenway T, Huhmer A, Langridge J, Connolly B, Chadick T, Holly K, Eckels J, Deutsch EW, Moritz RL, Katz JE, Agus DB, MacCoss M, Tabb DL, Mallick P.

To tentatively identify a compound, a combination of COSMIC and ZODIAC scores were considered. Manual analysis of the matching substructures was conducted before structural assignment was made. If the fragmentation pattern did not match the structures proposed by CSI:FingerID, matching fragments from the proposed structures were considered when the class when assigned using CANOPUS.
