                "description": "<p>Due to marketing recommendations, white wines are often bottled in flint glass to improve aesthetics and showcase wine color. Although this practice is known to cause a wine fault, the influence of light on the fruity and flowery aromatic profile of wine is unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the changes to the white wine volatilome under typical supermarket shelf conditions, using 1,052 bottles of 24 white wines. After only 7 d of shelf life in flint glass bottles, a dramatic loss in terpenes (10 to 30%) and norisoprenoids (30 to 70%) was recorded, whereas colored glass bottles did not evidence such behavior even after 50 d, and darkness preserved the wine's fruity and flowery aromatic integrity. We also proposed an alternative mechanism for the insurgence of the lightstrike off-odor, which takes the varietal aroma loss into account. In light of this understanding of the flint glass negative impact on white wine aroma identity and sensorial character, this packaging should be strongly discouraged. The same findings should be valid for a wide range of several daily consumed foodstuff where transparent packaging is used.</p>",

A room with a shelf was used to mimic the typical supermarket conditions. The room layout included <strong>windows </strong>with curtains (closed), <strong>shelfs </strong>of 4 levels and 5 columns (5 m x 2.5 m x 35 cm), air conditioner fixed at 20 \u00b0C and 4 tube lamps (TL-D 58W/33-640 1SL) turned on from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. The kinetic experiment was based on 4 mono-cultivar white <strong>wines </strong>from the 2015 harvest, 2 <strong>Pinot gris </strong>and 2 <strong>Chardonnay</strong>. A map with the position of each bottle on the shelf was prepared in advance, following a randomised order (<a href='www.random.org' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>www.random.org</a>). For each wine/bottle colour, 8 bottles were sampled at 7 time points (2, 7, 14, 22, 29, 40 and 50 days). The samples from the first 4 time points were divided as follows: 5 samples per wine/bottles were placed on the shelf at day 0 and sampled after 2, 7, 14 and 22 days, while 3 samples per wine/bottle were placed on the shelf 21, 14, 7 and 2 days before the end of the experiment and sampled at day 50. Time 0 was the 8th time point, so these bottles were stored directly at 4 \u00b0C and in the dark. For each wine, 8 bottles were left in the room simulating supermarket conditions but in a cardboard box, in order to have samples stored under the same environmental conditions but in complete darkness.</p><p>The results of the light-strike fault sensorial analysis, the CieLab colorimetric measurements, light (UV, Vis, and IR) and temperature exposure are reported in the previous publication (<a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fpsl.2020.100492' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fpsl.2020.100492</a>).</p>",

The mass threshold was set at 50 and the minimum similarity required to assign a compound name was set at 700. Under these conditions, we were able to detect putative compounds. A series of alkanes (C10-C30) was injected and the GC\u00d7GC-TOFMS was operated identically to the above-described protocols. Retention indices were used to calculate the experimental LRI, which was compared to the literature (<strong>NIST 2.0</strong> and <strong>Wiley 8 </strong>and <strong>FFNSC 2</strong>, <strong>VCF</strong>, <strong>Flavour net</strong>, <strong>ChemSpider</strong>). Mass spectra of the compounds that seem to be markers were compared to the mass spectra recorded in <strong>NIST 2.0</strong> and <strong>Wiley 8</strong> and <strong>FFNSC 2</strong> mass spectral library (Chromaleont, Messina, Italy), with a library similarity match of 700. Based on the identification level following assignments were given authentic standards, injected under identical GC\u00d7GC-TOFMS conditions, (1st level annotation); mass spectra and linear retention index) (2nd level of annotation); annotated based on their chemical group (3rd level of annotation);&nbsp;considered unknowns (4th level of annotation)<strong>[1]</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Sumner LW, Amberg A, Barrett D, Beale MH, Beger R, Daykin CA, Fan TW, Fiehn O, Goodacre R, Griffin JL, Hankemeier T, Hardy N, Harnly J, Higashi R, Kopka J, Lane AN, Lindon JC, Marriott P, Nicholls AW, Reily MD, Thaden JJ, Viant MR.
