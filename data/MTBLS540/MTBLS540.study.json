                "description": "1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy-based metabolic phenotyping is now widely used for large-scale epidemiological applications. To minimize signal overlap present in 1D 1H NMR spectra, we have investigated the use of 2D J-resolved (JRES) 1H NMR spectroscopy for large-scale phenotyping studies. In particular, we have evaluated the use of the 1D projections of the 2D JRES spectra (pJRES), which provide single peaks for each of the J-coupled multiplets, using 705 human plasma samples from the FGENTCARD cohort. On the basis of the assessment of several objective analytical criteria (spectral dispersion, attenuation of macromolecular signals, cross-spectral correlation with GC-MS metabolites, analytical reproducibility and biomarker discovery potential), we concluded that the pJRES approach exhibits suitable properties for implementation in large-scale molecular epidemiology workflows.",

The FGENTCARD cohort consists of over 7000 patients who underwent catheterization between 2006 and 2009 at 2 major university hospitals in Lebanon.[1] Plasma samples from patients who provided consent for the whole study were collected and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until analysis. In the current study, a subset of 705 plasma samples was used.

A 5 \u03bcl aliquot of each sample was pooled to prepare the quality control (QC) sample and 2 aliquots of the QC sample were added (positions 48 and 96) to each 96-well plate. Plates were stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until profiling. 100 \u03bcl of sample was thoroughly mixed with 100 \u03bcl of plasma buffer (75 mM Na2HPO4, pH 7.4, 4.6 mM 3-(trimethylsilyl)-[2,2,3,3-2H4]-propionate TSP, 6.2 mM sodium azide (NaN3), as a bacteriostatic agent, and 20% (v/v) of D2O)[1] in a different plate. 180 \u03bcl of the resulting solution was subsequently transferred into 3 mm NMR tubes using a Gilson liquid handling robot.\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Dona AC, Jim\u00e9nez B, Sch\u00e4fer H, Humpfer E, Spraul M, Lewis MR, Pearce JT, Holmes E, Lindon JC, Nicholson JK.

Irradiation at the water resonance frequency using a series of 25 Hz RF pulses was applied during the RD and also during the tm. For each sample, 64 transients were collected into 96 000 data points using a spectral window of 30 ppm. The spin\u2013echo experiment was acquired with the pulse sequence: -RD-90\u00b0-(t-180\u00b0-t)n-ACQ, where t is the spin\u2013spin relaxation delay (0.3 ms), 90\u00b0 represents the 90\u00b0 RF pulse, while 180\u00b0 is the 180\u00b0 RF pulse, and n represents the number of loops (256). For each sample, 64 transients were collected into 72 000 data points using a spectral window of 20 ppm. The sequence used for the 2D JRES experiment takes the form: -RD-90\u00b0-t1-180\u00b0-t1-ACQ, where the definitions are as above, plus t1 represents the increment delay. JRES spectra were acquired using 4 scans per increment over 40 increments that were collected in 8000 data points, using spectral windows of 16.6 ppm in F2 and 78 Hz in F1. The total data acquisition time of each of the 3 NMR experiments was 8 min.\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Dona AC, Jim\u00e9nez B, Sch\u00e4fer H, Humpfer E, Spraul M, Lewis MR, Pearce JT, Holmes E, Lindon JC, Nicholson JK.

For the 1D experiments, an exponential line broadening of 0.3 Hz and a zero-filling by a factor of 2 were applied prior to Fourier transformation. For the JRES experiment, zero-filling by a factor of 2 was included in the F2 dimension and the digital resolution was increased to 256 points in F1 by zero-filling. Apodization of JRES data using a sine-bell function was applied in both dimensions prior to Fourier transformation. The JRES spectra were then tilted, symmetrized and skyline- or sum-projected to obtain the pJRES spectra. Following phase and baseline corrections, all spectra (\u03b4 0.4\u201310) were imported into MATLAB 8.3 (Mathworks, USA) using in-house routines. The spectra were calibrated to the \u03b1-glucose anomeric signal at \u03b4 5.23[1] and aligned manually.[2] Spectral regions containing signals from water, EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) and EDTA cationic complexes were removed.\n</p>\nSignal-to-noise ratios (SN) of selected 1H NMR signals were calculated as the ratio of peak intensity at maximum height to the standard deviation of the noise (\u03b4 9.88\u20139.94). Line widths (LW) were calculated as the peak width at half height. For the spin\u2013echo experiment, multiplet footprints (MF) were calculated as the line width from half-height of the lowest frequency peak of the multiplet to the highest frequency peak of the multiplet. SN, LW and MF were calculated across the QC samples (n = 14) and reported as mean \u00b1 standard deviation.\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Pearce JT, Athersuch TJ, Ebbels TM, Lindon JC, Nicholson JK, Keun HC.
