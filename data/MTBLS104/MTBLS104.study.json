                "description": "Neuropeptide Y (NPY) and its Y2 receptors (Y2R) play an important role in regulating growth of various tumors and are highly expressed in human neuroblastoma brain tumors. Cell lines derived from neuroblastoma brain tumors provide a good model to study the consequences of NPY activation of Y2R in tumor metabolism. In this study, the metabolic response to activation and inhibition of Y2R was examined in the human neuroblastoma cell line SK-N-BE2 using high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). Three treatments were evaluated: (1) activation of Y2R with NPY, (2) blocking Y2R with BIIE0246, and (3) treatment of cells with both NPY and BIIE. The largest metabolic changes were observed for NPY activation of Y2R. The principal response to NPY activation of Y2R was increased glycolysis (Warburg effect). Our results also showed depleted intracellular nutrients in NPY activated cells, which may have been due to the high rate of conversion of glucose to lactate, glycine and alanine. All amino acids except glutamine were increased in response to Y2R activation, implying increased autophagic degradation of proteins. TCA cycle intermediates were not detected, possibly due to low steady-state concentrations, but the increase of glutamate and its high correlation with glucose provided evidence of increased TCA activity. The changes of most metabolites observed upon NPY treatment were reversed with BIIE treatment. In summary, our study indicates that NPY activation of Y2R in human neuroblastoma cells stimulates glycolysis, glutaminolysis and possibly TCA activity.",

                        "description": "The human neuroblastoma cell line SK-N-BE2 was used in this study. The neuroblastoma cells were grown in Eagle's essential medium (EMEM), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FBS), penicillin (100 IU/ml) and streptomycin (100 \u00b5g/ml) in a 95% air/5% CO2 humidified atmosphere at 37 \u00b0C as reported previously [1]. When the cells became 90% confluent (4\u20135 days), medium was replaced with the EMEM containing 0.25% FBS, and was used in the treatment experiments described below.\n</p>\nThree treatments were studied. Group 1 compared NPY-treated cells to a control (water) to monitor the cellular response to activation of Y2R by NPY. In Group 2, the Y2R receptor was blocked by BIIE (dissolved in ethanol) in treated cells and compared to cells treated with neat ethanol as a control. In Group 3, cells were treated with BIIE plus NPY versus NPY treatment alone to study the effect of selective blocking of Y2R in this Y2R-rich cell line. The dose concentration of NPY 100 nM and BIIE0246 was 1 \u00b5M. The dose values were chosen based\non published values shown to activate and inhibit NPY Y2R, respectively, in different tissue/cell systems [1][2]. The SK-N-BE2 cells\nwere treated with 1 \u00b5M Y2R antagonist, BIIE0246 in 0.25% FBS containing DMEM media. Fifteen minutes later 100 nM NPY was added to the cells and the incubation continued for additional 24 h and the media and the cells were extracted for the analysis. The order of treatment was antagonist first, 15 min later the agonist was added. NPY treatment for 48 h has been shown to increase cell growth by 40% and this increase was blocked by BIIE0246 [2]. The relative affinity of NPY (agonist) for Y2R is 0.2 nM and BIIE0246 (antagonist) is 15 nM [1].\n</p>\nWhen cells were grown to 75\u201385% confluence in 10 cm culture dishes, the media was aspirated and cells were trypsinized using trypsin\u2013EDTA solution (Invitrogen). Fresh growth media containing 10% FBS was added to the trypsinized cells (10:1 ratio) and centrifuged for 5 min at 1,500 rpm at 4 \u00b0C. The spent media was aspirated and stored for analysis and the cell pellet was washed with 10 ml of cold phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.4, and centrifuged again as above. This step was repeated two more times and the cell pellets were stored at -80 \u00b0C until removal for cell extraction.\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Balasubramaniam A1, Tao Z, Zhai W, Stein M, Sheriff S, Chance WT, Fischer JE, Eden PE, Taylor JE, Liu CD, McFadden DW, Voisin T, Roze C, Laburthe M.

                        "description": "Two 1H NMR experiments optimized were run on all samples: a standard 1D pulse and acquire pulse sequence employing water-suppression using pre-saturation (zgpr) and the one-dimensional first increment of a nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) experiment with pre-saturation (noesygppr1d). FIDs were apodized using exponential multiplication (EM) with line broadening equal to 0.3 Hz prior to Fourier transformation. All experiments included on-resonance water pre-saturation achieved by irradiation during a 4.0 s relaxation delay. The 90\u00b0 pulse width was determined for every sample using the automatic pulse calculation feature in TopSpin 3.1. All pulse widths were 8.5\u00b10.5 \u00b5s. The zgpr experiment was used to screen samples and ensure that pre-saturation and shimming were sufficient to collect reliable data. Shimming quality was determined by measuring the full width at half height (FWHH) of the Trimethylsilyl propionate (TSP) peak, which was deemed acceptable when the FWHH<1.0 Hz. One-dimensional zgpr 1H spectra were acquired using 8 scans and 2 dummy scans, with 45 K points per spectrum. This resulted in an acquisition time of 1.92 s. Once the spectrum was determined to be of acceptable quality the 1D NOESY experiment was collected. The one-dimensional first increment of the NOESY experiment was collected using 128 scans with 4 dummy scans. 65 K points per spectrum were collected which resulted in an acquisition time of 3.21 s. All NMR spectra were processed using the AU program apk0.noe. This AU program automatically corrects phase, baseline, and chemical shift registration relative to TSP in TopSpin 3.1.",

                        "description": "NMR spectra bucketing and PCA were conducted using Amix (Bruker Biospin, Billerica, MA, USA). Dynamic manual bucketing enabled use of unequal bucket widths, which allowed for optimization of the bucket widths and the center frequency of the buckets to ensure that a single peak was included in one bucket. Consequently, the manual bucketing guaranteed that the bucket intensity accurately preserve metabolite concentration information [1]. Prior to manual bucketing, spectral were aligned relative to the added TSP. After alignment, buckets belonging to the same metabolite and the same peak feature were determined manually as well. Any spectral features that were obviously overlapped based on visual inspection were excluded from the analysis. All spectra were subjected to total intensity normalization [2] and Pareto scaling [3] was applied before PCA. Residual water and internal standard peaks were excluded from analysis. Statistical significance analysis of the loadings data was performed using Amix based on the procedure we have previously published [4] except that a Kruskal\u2013Wallis test [5] was used instead of the Mann\u2013Whitney U test for non-parametric analysis of datasets that were not normally distributed.\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Lindon, J.
