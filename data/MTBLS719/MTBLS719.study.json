                "description": "To better understand the molecular mechanisms underpinning physiological variation in human populations, metabolic phenotyping approaches are increasingly being applied to studies involving hundreds and thousands of biofluid samples. Hyphenated ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) has become a fundamental tool for this purpose. However, the seemingly inevitable need to analyze large studies in multiple analytical batches for UPLC-MS analysis poses a challenge to data quality which has been recognized in the field. Herein, we describe in detail a fit-for-purpose UPLC-MS platform, method set, and sample analysis workflow, capable of sustained analysis on an industrial scale and allowing batch-free operation for large studies. Using complementary reversed-phase chromatography (RPC) and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) together with high resolution orthogonal acceleration time-of-flight mass spectrometry (oaTOF-MS), exceptional measurement precision is exemplified with independent epidemiological sample sets of approximately 650 and 1000 participant samples. Evaluation of molecular reference targets in repeated injections of pooled quality control (QC) samples distributed throughout each experiment demonstrates a mean retention time relative standard deviation (RSD) of <0.3% across all assays in both studies and a mean peak area RSD of <15% in the raw data. To more globally assess the quality of the profiling data, untargeted feature extraction was performed followed by data filtration according to feature intensity response to QC sample dilution. Analysis of the remaining features within the repeated QC sample measurements demonstrated median peak area RSD values of <20% for the RPC assays and <25% for the HILIC assays. These values represent the quality of the raw data, as no normalization or feature-specific intensity correction was applied. While the data in each experiment was acquired in a single continuous batch, instances of minor time-dependent intensity drift were observed, highlighting the utility of data correction techniques despite reducing the dependency on them for generating high quality data. These results demonstrate that the platform and methodology presented herein is fit-for-use in large scale metabolic phenotyping studies, challenging the assertion that such screening is inherently limited by batch effects. Details of the pipeline used to generate high quality raw data and mitigate the need for batch correction are provided.",

                        "description": "<p>The Alzheimer\u2019s disease study consists of a series of serum, plasma and urine biofluid samples collected as part of the AddNeuroMed and ART/DCR study consortia<strong>[1]</strong>, which follow patients longitudinally with the aim of identifying biomarkers of neurocognitive decline and Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The samples analysed by LC-MS and NMR, and for which data is provided in this MetaboLights study, are baseline spot urine samples (first sample collected after&nbsp;recruitment to the study). Patients were asked to fast for 2 h prior to urine sample collection, and no samples in this set were freeze-thawed before use in this trial.</p><p><br></p><p>The cohort consists of 2 broad groups of subjects. Subjects with <strong>AD </strong>were collected from the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust. Subjects with MCI and unaffected <strong>controls </strong>were ascertained through primary care. In brief, participating GP clinics contacted all registered patients over the age of 70 and patients were invited to attend the practice for an assessment of memory. Screening assessment consisted of information and consent processes and a screening assessment for dementia. Subjects with normal cognition were entered into the study as unaffected controls, patients with impaired cognition or subjective memory impairment then underwent a full assessment consisting of cognition, behaviour and function together with an extensive clinical interview. Subjects meeting Petersen criteria for amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment and NINCDS-ADRDA criteria for possible or probable Alzheimer\u2019s disease were classified accordingly. A proportion of subjects have had MRI, and in some cases, serial MRI. All subjects were assessed annually \u2013 <strong>controls </strong>by a standardised telephone interview for cognition (TICS-M) and MCI and <strong>AD </strong>groups using a full interview including cognitive assessment. <strong>Control </strong>subjects receive full interview assessment if cognitive score suggests deterioration and possible conversion to MCI. Conversion from MCI to dementia is assessed by cognitive and other deterioration and by review by an experienced clinician. Detailed information about this cohort and clinical metadata can be found in the previous published paper<strong>[1] </strong>and the ANMERGE repository<strong>[2]</strong>, available via the Sage BioNetworks portal (<a href='https://doi.org/10.7303/syn22252881' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>https://doi.org/10.7303/syn22252881</a>).</p><p><br></p><p>The Alzheimer\u2019s disease study samples came from the AddNeuroMed and ART/DCR studies with ethical approval from boards in the respective study site institutions across Europe.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Sample handling and aliquotting</strong></p><p>Urine samples were received on dry ice and immediately stored at -80 \u00b0C. Meta-data variables essential to the design of the study were identified and used to determine sample analysis orders that were uncorrelated with those factors using in-house software, avoiding the potential for confounding critical clinical variables with analytical run order effects. For each study, this order was preloaded into an in-house laboratory information management system (LIMS). Samples were then sorted into sets of 80 using aluminium racks (9x9 position format) cooled by direct contact with dry ice to ensure that all samples remained frozen for the duration of the sorting exercise. Completed sets were stored at -80 \u00b0C until required for subsequent steps.</p><p><br></p><p>Once sorted, individual urine sample sets were reformatted into 96-well plates. This step required the overnight thawing of a set of 80 samples at 4 \u00b0C, mixing of each individual sample by vortexing, and transference of the liquid contents of each sample to a well within a 96-deep-well polypropylene plate (2 mL, Eppendorf). During this process, each sample was checked against a LIMS-generated map of sample identifiers and positions in the 96-well plate to validate the batch composition and sample order. Study samples were added only to the wells within the first 10 columns of rows A through H; columns 11 and 12 of the plate were reserved for the later addition of pooled quality control (<strong>QC</strong>) reference samples. The plate was sealed with a silicone cap mat and centrifuged at 3,486 \u00d7 g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C using an Eppendorf 5810R centrifuge equipped with an A-2-DWP-AT rotor for the removal of suspended particulate matter such as cryoprecipitate, cellular debris, or crystalline material. The supernatant was aspirated and dispensed in pre-programmed volumes among 96-well polypropylene plates using an 8-channel 15-1200 \u03bcL Eppendorf Xplorer Plus pipette with an initial discarding step into an 800 mL beaker to be used as <strong>NMR </strong>Study Reference. The volume dispensed in plates included 600 \u03bcL to a 2.0 mL plate (<strong>NMR</strong>), 150 \u03bcL to a 0.5 mL plate (reversed-phase chromatography, <strong>RPC</strong>), 50 \u03bcL to a 0.5 mL plate (hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography, <strong>HILIC</strong>) and 50 \u03bcL to a 0.3 mL plate (study reference, <strong>SR</strong>, sample). All plates were sealed with a silicone cap mat and returned to -80 \u00b0C.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Preparation of Method Reference (MR) and Internal Standards (IS) mixtures</strong></p><p>Mixtures of reference chemicals were generated for both <strong>RPC </strong>and <strong>HILIC </strong>methods, enabling the targeted assessment of instrument stability (e.g.chromatographic retention, mass accuracy, and signal intensity) and data quality. <strong>IS </strong>are added to all samples in the study and<strong> MR</strong> standards are also added to all <strong>QC </strong>samples. L-phenylalanine13C9, 15N (from Sigma-Aldrich (Steinheim, Germany)) and N-benzoyl-d5-glycine (hippuric acid, from QMX (Essex, U.K.)) were used in both chromatographic assay types as a 2-point IS. The RPC <strong>MR </strong>was composed of 8 reference standards from Sigma-Aldrich and QMX: L-glutamic acid-13C5; L-isoleucine-13C6,15N; L-leucine-13C6, L-tryptophan-13C11,15N2; L-glutamine-13C5; creatinine-(methyl-d3), cytidine-5,6-d2; and benzoic acid-phenyl-13C6. 2 of these standards were determined to not be suitable for analysis of <strong>RPC+</strong> data quality (L-glutamine13C5 and benzoic acid-phenyl13C6), while 1 was not suitable for analysis <strong>RPC-</strong> data (creatinine-(methyl-d3), cytidine-5,6-d2). The <strong>HILIC MR </strong>was composed of 6 reference standards from Sigma-Aldrich, QMX and CDN isotopes (Quebec, Canada): adenosine-2-d1; adenine-2-d1; 2-aminoethane-d4-sulfonic acid(taurine-d4); creatine-(guanidino-13C)monohydrate; L-arginine-13C6; and uracil-2-13C,15N2.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Preparation of Quality Control (QC) samples</strong></p><p>QC samples were analysed at regular intervals throughout the run and utilized to support the assessment of data quality within each experiment for LC-MS and NMR analysis.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Long Term Reference (LTR)</strong></p><p>A pooled <strong>Long Term Reference</strong> (<strong>LTR</strong>) urine sample is maintained by the laboratory and is used as an independent sample reference throughout all molecular profiling studies. To create this material, 78 individual urine voids were collected in a single day from volunteer subjects. No screening criteria were used to assess the health status of the donors. All samples were stored at 4 \u00b0C from collection until the following day when all samples were combined and aliquoted by the following procedure. Individual samples were centrifuged at 4 \u00b0C for 15 min at 3,214 \u00d7 g and their supernatants combined in a 20 L polypropylene vessel. The pooled sample was homogenized in the vessel by gentle stirring using a Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar and magnetic stir plate. Aliquots were created by multiple iterations of dispensing 1 L of pooled urine supernatant to a 1 L glass bottle and aliquoting that material into 15 mL polypropylene conical centrifuge tubes (Corning) using an Eppendorf 5-25 mL Varispenser plus. This process was repeated until all of the reference material was aliquoted. All aliquots were stored at -80 \u00b0C until required for further preparation. A sufficient volume of LTR sample (approximately 2 mL per 80 study samples) was thawed for <strong>RPC </strong>and <strong>HILIC </strong>assays and supplemented with the relevant <strong>RPC </strong>and <strong>HILIC MR </strong>mixtures in a 2:1 LTR:MR ratio, homogenized, and aliquoted to 1.7 mL polypropylene microcentrifuge tubes. All LTR materials were frozen at -80 \u00b0C until required for analytical plate preparation.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Study Reference (SR)</strong></p><p>A pooled <strong>Study Reference </strong>(<strong>SR</strong>)<strong> </strong>sample representing the mean of samples within the Alzheimer\u2019s study was prepared. For <strong>NMR </strong>analysis the <strong>SR </strong>was created by pooling a small volume of each sample in the study into an 800 mL beaker during the sampling reformatting step. The beaker was frozen overnight and homogenised at the end of the reformatting process, then subsequently split into 5 mL aliquots and taken back to -80 \u00b0C. 2 aliquots of 600 \u03bcL were added to each <strong>NMR </strong>plate before analysis. For <strong>LC-MS</strong> analysis, the <strong>SR </strong>was created by thawing the contents of all <strong>SR </strong>sample plates (with 50 \u03bcL of each sample) at 4\u00b0C and combining their contents in an 800 mL glass beaker. Optionally, individual samples determined to be unsuitable for <strong>UPLC-MS</strong> analysis (by sample pre-screening via <strong>NMR </strong>spectroscopy) were removed from the individual <strong>SR </strong>sample plate wells prior to pooling in order to avoid incorporation of severely contaminated or outlying samples which may compromise the <strong>SR</strong>. The pooled sample was homogenized by swirling and portioned in an approximate 3:1 ratio for use with <strong>RPC </strong>and <strong>HILIC </strong>assays respectively. The <strong>RPC </strong>and <strong>HILIC </strong>sub-fractions were supplemented with the relevant <strong>RPC </strong>and <strong>HILIC MR</strong> mixtures in a 2:1 <strong>SR:MR</strong> ratio, homogenized, and aliquoted to 1.7 mL polypropylene microcentrifuge tubes. All <strong>SR </strong>materials were frozen at -80 \u00b0C until required for analytical plate preparation.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Dilution series</strong></p><p>A dilution series of <strong>SR </strong>samples was prepared for each assay type from thawed <strong>SR </strong>in the same manner described above except that they were prepared in bulk volume in Eppendorf microcentrifuge tubes and the products were stored in polypropylene sample vials for analysis supporting multiple injections from the same stock. Prior to and immediately following the analysis of each experiment\u2019s samples, dilution series samples were analysed by repeated measurement aimed at weighting the ends of the series (10,10,5,3,3,5, and 10 consecutive replicate injections of the 1%, 10%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100% <strong>SR </strong>samples respectively).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1] </strong>Lovestone S, Francis P, Kloszewska I, Mecocci P, Simmons A, Soininen H, Spenger C, Tsolaki M, Vellas B, Wahlund LO, Ward M; AddNeuroMed Consortium.

LTR stock and SR stock aliquots were thawed and their contents distributed among the wells of columns 11 and 12, respectively (225 \u03bcL for RPC analysis and 75 \u03bcL for HILIC analysis). Finally, the IS solution was added to all samples (75 \u03bcL for RPC preparation and 25 \u03bcL for HILIC preparation). Sample plates for RPC analysis were sealed with a silicone cap mat, mixed for 1 min at 4 \u00b0C using a MixMate (Eppendorf) operating at 850 rpm, and centrifuged for 10 min at 3,486 \u00d7 g. The supernatant was split between 2 analytical microwell plates, 1 for positive and 1 for negative ion mode UPLC-MS analysis. Acetonitrile (ACN) was added to samples for HILIC analysis in a 3:1 ACN:sample ratio to better match the initial solvent conditions of the chromatographic method. The sample plate was then sealed with Thermo-Seal heat sealing foil sheets using an ALPS 50 V-Manual Heat Sealer (Thermo SCIENTIFIC) prior to mixing for 1 minute at 4 \u00b0C using a MixMate (Eppendorf) operating at 850 rpm. The plates were subsequently centrifuged for 10 min at 3486 \u00d7 g to remove any residual protein precipitated by this addition of organic solvent, and a 150 \u03bcL volume of the supernatant was decanted to a microplate for analysis. Once prepared, plates were loaded into the UPLC sample manager where they were held at 4 \u00b0C until analysis.</p>",

The sample handling component was a Waters 2777C sample manager (Waters Corp., Milford, MA, USA) equipped with a 25 \u03bcL Hamilton syringe, a 2 \u03bcL loop used for full-loop injections (with a 5-fold overfill were used, aspirating and injecting 10 \u00b5L of prepared sample), and a 3-drawer sample chamber thermo-stated at 4 \u00b0C with a constant flow of dry nitrogen gas. Seal wash consisted of isopropanol:water (1:9, v/v), weak needle wash isopropanol:water (1:9, v/v) for RPC and ACN:water (3:1, v/v)&nbsp;for HILIC and the strong needle wash was 100% isopropanol. All reagents were of LCMS grade from Sigma-Aldrich (Steinheim, Germany) (formic acid, ACN and isopropanol) and Fisher Scientific (Hampton, NH, USA) (water).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Reverse Phase</strong></p><p>For RPC, separation was performed in a 1.8 \u00b5m, 2.1 x 150 mm ACQUITY UPLC HSS T3 column (Waters Corp., Milford, MA, USA) thermostatted at 45 \u00b0C was used with a mobile phase flow rate of 0.6 mL/min. The solvent system chosen was water (A) and acetonitrile (B) each supplemented with 0.1% formic acid. After a 0.1 min isocratic separation at initial conditions (99% A), a linear gradient elution (99% to 45% A in 9.9 min) was applied, followed by a more rapid gradient (45% to 0% A in 0.7 min) to final conditions. In the latter stage, the mobile phase flow rate was simultaneously increased to 1.0 mL/min, allowing faster column washing. Further details on the gradient conditions can be found in the paper associated with this study.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>HILIC</strong></p><p>For HILIC, separation was conducted using a 1.7 \u00b5m, 2.1 x 150 mm ACQUITY UPLC BEH HILIC column (Waters Corp., Milford, MA, USA) thermostatted at 40 \u00b0C. The solvent system was acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid (A) and 20 mM ammonium formate in water with 0.1%formic acid (B) with a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min. After a 0.1 min isocratic separation at initial conditions (95% A), a 2-stage gradient was conducted. First, a shallow linear gradient between 95% and 80% A was used followed by a more rapid gradient from 80% to 50% A. Following a return to initial composition, the flow rate was increased to 1.0 mL/min to expedite extended equilibration of the chromatographic system.

The relaxation delays were set to 2 s to reduce the experimental time, and all pulse sequences included a pre-saturation period to suppress water signal. The 1H spectral window was set to 12.0 ppm and either 190 or 230 ppm for the 13C windows of <strong>HSQC </strong>or <strong>HMBC </strong>respectively. The centre of the 1H window was centred on the water signal and either at 85 or 105 ppm for the indirect dimension of <strong>HSQC </strong>and <strong>HMBC</strong>, respectively.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Refs</strong>:</p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Sumner LW, Amberg A, Barrett D, Beale MH, Beger R, Daykin CA, Fan TW, Fiehn O, Goodacre R, Griffin JL, Hankemeier T, Hardy N, Harnly J, Higashi R, Kopka J, Lane AN, Lindon JC, Marriott P, Nicholls AW, Reily MD, Thaden JJ, Viant MR.

The sequence has the form \u2013RD \u2013gz,1 \u201390\u00b0 \u2013t \u201390\u00b0 \u2013tm\u2013gz,2\u201390\u00b0 \u2013ACQ, where RD is the relaxation delay (4 s), t is a short delay typically of about 3 \u03bcs, 90\u00b0 represents a 90\u00b0 RF pulse, tm is the mixing time (10 ms), gz,1 and gz,2 are magnetic field z-gradients both applied for 1 ms, and ACQ is the data acquisition period (2.7 s). Application of the gradients ensures that dispersive residual water signals are filtered out and do not contribute to the final spectrum. The spectral window is set to 20 ppm for urine. In total 32 transients are acquired with 64 k data points for urine. The receiver gain was set to 90.5 for all of the experiments. 1H pulses were calculated in automation for each sample while the centre of the window was set on the water signal of the SR sample and kept constant during the acquisition of the whole dataset.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>J-resolved sequence</strong></p><p>The Bruker J-resolved pulse sequence (<strong>jresgpprqf </strong>in Bruker database) takes the form \u2013RD-90\u00b0-t1-180\u00b0-t1-ACQ, where t1 is an incremented time period, RD is the relaxation delay (2 s), t1 is the increment delay, 90\u00b0 represents a 90\u00b0 RF pulse while 180\u00b0 is the 180\u00b0 RF pulse, ACQ is the data acquisition period. The spectral window is set to 16.6 ppm for the direct dimension and 78 Hz for the indirect dimension. 2 scans are acquired over 40 increments in the indirect dimension. Continuous wave irradiation is applied at the water resonance frequency using 25 Hz RF strength during the relaxation delay RD. More information about the pulse sequences used can be found in the previously published paper<strong>[1]</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Processing of the spectra (including Fourier transformation, phasing, baseline correction and calibration) was done in automation using <strong>TopSpin 3.6</strong> (Bruker Coorporation, Germany). For the 1-dimensional NOESY-presat experiment, the line broadening was set to 0.3 Hz, a 0-filling by a factor of 2 is used to produce 132 K data points for processing, and the first-order phase correction set to 0.0. The data was then automatically phased using only 0-order phase correction, the TSP was calibrated to 0.0 Hz (0.0 ppm). The processing for the J-resolved employed 0-filling by a factor of 2 is included in the F2 dimension and the digital resolution is increased to 256 points in F1 by 0-filling. The limits for spectral processing are set to \u00b1 20 Hz. The raw data is then Fourier transformed, tilted, symmetrized around the central horizontal (F2) axis and automatically baseline corrected in the F2 dimension. The TSP signal is then calibrated to 0.0 ppm in the F2 dimension and to 0.0 Hz in the F1 dimension. Data was subsequently QCed assessing line width, water suppression and base line. Any spectra not complying the required criteria was rerun. Samples were remixed inside their tubes before the new experiment was acquired.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1] </strong>Dona AC, Jim\u00e9nez B, Sch\u00e4fer H, Humpfer E, Spraul M, Lewis MR, Pearce JT, Holmes E, Lindon JC, Nicholson JK.
