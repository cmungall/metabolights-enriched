                "description": "<p>Pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) and diabetes mellitus (DM) are common chronic diseases that threaten human health. Patients with DM are susceptible to PTB, an important factor that aggravates the complications of diabetes. However, the molecular regulatory mechanism underlying the susceptibility of patients with DM to PTB infection remains unknown. Healthy subjects, patients with primary PTB and patients with primary PTB complicated by DM were recruited according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. Peripheral whole blood was collected, and alteration profiles and potential molecular mechanisms were further analyzed using integrated bioinformatics analysis of metabolomics and transcriptomics. In this study, transcriptional data revealed that lipocalin 2 (LCN2), defensin alpha 1 (DEFA1), peptidoglycan recognition protein 1 (PGLYRP1) and integrin subunit alpha 2b (ITGA2B) were significantly upregulated, while chloride intracellular channel 3 (CLIC3) significantly down-regulated in PTB-DM by contrast to HC group. Additionally, the IL-17, PI3K-AKT and PPAR signaling pathways are important for PTB infection and regulation of PTB-complicated diabetes. Metabolomic data showed that glycerophospholipid metabolism, carbon metabolism and fat digestion and absorption processes were enriched in the differential metabolic analysis. Finally, integrated analysis of both metabolomic and transcriptomic data indicated that the NOTCH1/JAK/STAT signaling pathway is important in PTB complicated by DM. In conclusion, PTB infection altered the transcriptional and metabolic profiles of patients with DM. Metabolomic and transcriptomic changes were highly correlated in PTB-infected patients with DM. Peripheral metabolite levels may be used as biomarkers for PTB management in patients with DM.</p><p><strong>IMPORTANCE:</strong> The comorbidity of diabetes mellitus (DM) significantly increases the risk of tuberculosis infection and adverse tuberculosis treatment outcomes. Most previous studies have focused on the relationship between the effect of blood glucose control and the outcome of anti-tuberculosis treatment in pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB)-DM; however, early prediction and the underlying molecular mechanism of susceptibility to PTB infection in patients with DM remain unclear. Here, transcriptome sequencing and untargeted metabolomics were performed to elucidatethe key molecules and signaling pathways involved in PTB infection and the susceptibility of patients with diabetes to PTB. Our findings contribute to the development of vital diagnostic biomarkers for PTB or PTB-DM and provide acomprehensive understanding of molecular regulation during disease progression.</p>",

Raw LC-MS data files were converted into mzXML format and then processed by the XCMS, CAMERA and metaX packages using the R language<strong>[1]-[3]</strong>. Each ion was identified by combining retention time (RT) and m/z data. The intensity of each peak was recorded, and a 3D matrix containing arbitrarily assigned peak indices (retention time-m/z pairs), sample names (observations) and ion intensity information (variables) was generated. Online KEGG and HMDB databases were used to annotate metabolites by matching the exact molecular mass data (m/z) of the samples with those from the databases, and an in-house fragment spectrum library of metabolites was used to validate the identification of metabolites. The intensities of the peaks were further preprocessed using MetaX. Features that were detected in less than 50% of the QC samples or 80% of the biological samples were removed, and the remaining peaks with missing values were imputed using the k-nearest neighbor algorithm to further improve the data quality. PCA was performed for outlier detection and batch-effect evaluation using a preprocessed dataset. Quality control-based robust LOESS signal correction was fitted to the QC data with respect to the order of injection to minimize signal intensity drift over time. In addition, the relative standard deviations of the metabolic features were calculated across all QC samples and those &gt; 30% were then removed. Student\u2019s t-tests were conducted to detect differences in metabolite concentrations between the 2 phenotypes and the p-value was adjusted for multiple tests using a False Discovery Rate (FDR) (Benjamini-Hochberg). Supervised partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) was conducted using metaX to discriminate the different variables between the groups and the altered metabolites between the 2 groups were identified by variable importance in the projection (VIP) &gt; 1 from the PLS-DA and statistical analysis (p &lt; 0.05). A total of 200 permutation tests were performed to investigate the quality of the model. The altered metabolites were analyzed using metabolomic pathway analysis (http://www.metaboanalyst.ca/) and correlated with potential pathways. The KEGG database was used to identify the functions of these metabolites in various metabolic pathways.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Smith CA, Want EJ, O'Maille G, Abagyan R, Siuzdak G.
