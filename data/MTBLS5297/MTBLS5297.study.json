                "description": "<p><strong>OBJECTIVE:</strong> Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a progressive disease including four stages, where gut microbiome is associated with pathogenesis. We aimed to investigate stage-specific roles of microbial dysbiosis and metabolic disorders in RA.</p><p><strong>METHODS:</strong> We investigated stage-based profiles of faecal metagenome and plasma metabolome of 76 individuals with RA grouped into four stages (stages I-IV) according to 2010 RA classification criteria, 19 individuals with osteroarthritis and 27 healthy individuals. To verify bacterial invasion of joint synovial fluid, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, bacterial isolation and scanning electron microscopy were conducted on another validation cohort of 271 patients from four RA stages.</p><p><strong>RESULTS:</strong> First, depletion of <em>Bacteroides uniformis</em> and <em>Bacteroides plebeius</em> weakened glycosaminoglycan metabolism (p&lt;0.001), continuously hurting articular cartilage across four stages. Second, elevation of <em>Escherichia coli</em> enhanced arginine succinyltransferase pathway in the stage II and stage III (p&lt;0.001), which was correlated with the increase of the rheumatoid factor (p=1.35 x 10^-3) and could induce bone loss. Third, abnormally high levels of methoxyacetic acid (p=1.28 x 10^-8) and cysteine-S-sulfate (p=4.66 x 10^-12) inhibited osteoblasts in the stage II and enhanced osteoclasts in the stage III, respectively, promoting bone erosion. Fourth, continuous increase of gut permeability may induce gut microbial invasion of the joint synovial fluid in the stage IV.</p><p><strong>CONCLUSIONS:</strong> Clinical microbial intervention should consider the RA stage, where microbial dysbiosis and metabolic disorders present distinct patterns and played stage-specific roles. Our work provides a new insight in understanding gut-joint axis from a perspective of stages, which opens up new avenues for RA prognosis and therapy.</p>",

A total of 122 faecal and 122 plasma samples were collected from 122 outpatients of the The First Affiliated Hospital of Shandong First Medical University from 2017 to 2020<strong>[1]</strong>. These outpatients included 76 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 19 patients with osteroarthritis (OA) and 27 healthy individuals (Table 1 in the paper associated with this study). Patients with RA were grouped into 4 RA stages including RAS1 (n=15), RAS2 (n=21), RAS3 (n=18) and RAS4 (n=22) according to the rheumatoid diagnostic score<strong>[2]</strong>, where RAS1, RAS2, RAS3 and RAS4 has a score of 6-7, 8, 9 and 10, respectively. The score was evaluated by the sum of 4 categories as summarised in the 2010 RA classification criteria<strong>[2]</strong>. Faecal samples were collected and sequenced and plasma samples were used to test the plasma metabolites, anticitrullinated protein antibody, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C reactive protein, rheumatoid factor, cytokines and plasma metabolites.

Synovial fluid samples were collected aseptically from knee joints during therapeutic aspiration. The entire experiment was conducted in a completely sterile atmosphere. For each patient, a total of 7\u2009mL synovial fluid was collected, of which 5\u2009mL was used for 16S rRNA gene sequencing, 1\u2009mL was used for bacteria isolation and 1\u2009mL synovial fluid was prepared for scanning electron microscopy.</p><p><br></p><p>All of the participants were at fasting status during the sample collection in the morning.
