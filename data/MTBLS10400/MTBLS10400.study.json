                "description": "<p>Glycosphingolipids (GSLs) are essential components of cell membranes, particularly enriched in the nervous system. Altered molecular distributions of GSLs are increasingly associated with human diseases, emphasizing the significance of lipidomic profiling. Traditional GSL analysis methods are hampered by matrix effect from phospholipids and the difficulty in distinguishing structural isomers. Herein, we introduce a highly sensitive workflow that harnesses magnetic TiO2 nanoparticle-based selective enrichment, charge-tagging Patern\u00f2\u2013B\u00fcchi reaction, and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. This approach enables mapping over 300 distinct GSLs in brain tissues by defining sugar types, long chain bases, N-acyl chains, and the locations of desaturation and hydroxylation. Relative quantitation of GSLs across multiple structural levels provides evidence of dysregulated gene and protein expressions of FA2H and CerS2 in human glioma tissue. Based on the structural features of GSLs, our method accurately differentiates human glioma with/without isocitrate dehydrogenase genetic mutation, and normal brain tissue.</p>",

Briefly, a 25 mg sample of brain tissue was placed in a 10 mL centrifuge tube. 1 mL of deionized water was added, and the tissue was homogenized using a handheld homogenizer (Jingxin Technology) at 40,000 Hz for 5 min. Subsequently, 1 mL of methanol (MeOH) and 2 mL of chloroform were added, and the tube was agitated for 10 min. The mixture was then centrifuged at 12,960 x g for 10 min, and the bottom layer was extracted and transferred to another tube. This extraction process was repeated once. The bottom layers from both extractions were combined and dried under a flow of nitrogen. Then, 1 mL of MeOH was added to resuspend the extracts, which were stored at -20 \u00b0C for further analysis.</p><p><br></p><p>The Patern\u00f2-B\u00fcchi derivatization was performed using a homemade flow microreactor. GSLs enriched from 100 \u03bcg of porcine brain lipids or lipid extracts from 400 \u03bcg of human brain tissue were mixed with 10 mM <strong>2-acetylpyridine</strong> in a 100 \u03bcL buffer (acetonitrile/H2O, 5:1 v/v). The solution was deoxygenated with nitrogen for 10 min and then injected into the flow microreactor for 15 s of UV irradiation (~254 nm).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Selective enrichment of GSLs</strong></p><p>The lipids and IS (HexCer 18:1;O2/15:0) were mixed with TiO2 MNPs in loading buffer (ACN/aqueous NH3, 94/6, v/v, 400 \u03bcL) before subjection to 1 h agitation. TiO2 MNPs were separated by magnet and washed by washing buffer (MeOH/aqueous NH3, 96/4, v/v, 20 mM NH4HCO3) 2 times (2 \u00d7 400 \u03bcL). GSLs were released by 2 h agitation in eluting buffer (MeOH/FA, 95/5, v/v). We mixed a total of 40 \u03bcg of 3 phospholipid standards representative of PC, PE, and SM and 5 GSL standards (0.008 \u2013 2 \u03bcg each), including HexCer 18:1;O2/15:0, HexCer 18:1;O2/18:1, HexCer 18:1;O2/24:1, HexCer 18:1;O2/18:0;2OH, and Hex2Cer 18:1;O2/17:0 with 5 mg of TiO2 MNPs and 400 \u03bcL of loading buffer.</p><p><br></p><p>For the enrichment of GSLs from porcine brain lipid extracts, 100 \u03bcg of porcine brain lipids were mixed with 5 mg of TiO2 MNPs, 100 pmol of IS (HexCer 18:1;O2/15:0), and 400 \u03bcL of loading buffer. For the enrichment of GSLs from human brain lipid extracts, lipids from 400 \u03bcg of human brain tissue was mixed with 5 mg of TiO2 MNPs, 200 pmol of IS (HexCer 18:1;O2/15:0), and 400 \u03bcL of loading buffer. The enrichment process followed the same as described above. Further details are provided in the Supplementary information.</p>",
