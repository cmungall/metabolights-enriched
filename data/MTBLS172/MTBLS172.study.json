                "description": "1H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was used to investigate the metabolic consequences of general anesthesia in the plasma of two groups of patients with diagnosis for non-metastatic colorectal cancer and metastatic colorectal cancer with liver-metastasis, respectively. Patients were treated with Etomidate or Propofol, two frequently used sedation agents. Plasma samples were obtained via Ficoll separation. Here, we demonstrated that this procedure introduces a number of limitations for NMR-based metabolomics studies, due to the appearance of spurious signals. Nevertheless, the comparison of the 1H NMR metabolomic profiles of patients treated with Etomidate or Propofol at equipotent dose ranges was still feasible and proved that both agents significantly decrease the plasma levels of several NMR-detectable metabolites. Consequently, samples collected during anesthesia are not suitable for metabolic profiling studies aimed at patient stratification, because interpersonal variability are reduced by the overall depression of metabolites levels. On the other hand, this study showed that plasma metabolomics could represent a valuable tool to monitor the effect of different sedation agents and/or the individual metabolic response to anesthesia, providing hints for an appropriate tuning of personalized sedation procedures. In our reference groups, the metabolomic signatures were slightly different in patients anesthetized with Etomidate versus Propofol. The importance of standardized collection procedures and availability of exhaustive metadata of the experimental design for the accurate evaluation of the significance of the observed changes in metabolites levels are critically discussed.",

Each spectrum in the range between 0.20 and 10.00 ppm was segmented into 0.02-ppm chemical shift bins, and the corresponding spectral areas were integrated using the AMIX software (Bruker BioSpin). Regions between 6.00 and 3.30 ppm containing residual water signal and the broad and intense absorption attributable to the Ficoll contamination were excluded in subsequent statistical analyses. The total spectral area was calculated on the remaining bins and total area normalization was carried out on the data prior to pattern recognition.",

                        "description": "Various kinds of multivariate and univariate statistical techniques were applied on the obtained buckets using R 3.0.2 in house scripts. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to obtain a preliminary outlook of the data (visualization in a reduced space, clusters detection, screening for outliers), partial least squares (PLS) and multilevel PLS (MPLS) were employed to perform supervised data reduction and classification. Canonical analysis (CA) was used in combination with PLS to increase the supervised separation of the analyzed groups. Accuracy, specificity and sensitivity were estimated according to standard definitions. The global accuracy for classification was assessed by means of a Monte carlo cross-validation scheme.\n</p>\nTwenty metabolites (plus the antibiotic Cefuroxime), whose peaks in the spectra were well defined and resolved, were assigned. Signal identification was performed using a library of NMR spectra of pure organic compounds, public databases (such as HMBD, human metabolic database, and SDBS, spectra database for organic compounds) storing reference NMR spectra of metabolites, spiking NMR experiments and literature data [1]. The relative concentrations of the various metabolites in the different spectra were calculated by integrating the signal area [2]. The Wilcoxon test was used for the determination of the meaningful metabolites. False discovery rate correction was applied using the Benjamini & Hochberg method (FDR) [3]: an adjusted p value of 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n</p>\nThe changes in metabolites levels between two groups of spectra are calculated as the log2 fold change (FC) ratio of the normalized median intensities of the corresponding signals in the spectra of the two groups (Fold change). When two groups were constituted by individuals that could be compared in pairs (e.g. the same individual before and after anesthesia) a pairwise analysis was performed. Pairwise Wilcoxon test (univariate statistics) and multilevel PLS [4][5] were used to this purpose.\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Psychogios N, Hau DD, Peng J, et al. The human serum metabolome.
