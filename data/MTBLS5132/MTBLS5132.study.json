In recent years, global climate change has led to an increase in atmospheric CO2 content and average daily temperature, making heat stress a major challenge in dairy farming. This experiment combined 16S rDNA sequencing, metagenomic sequencing and metabolomic analysis. In this experiment, 10 cows each of growing heifers, heifers and lactating cows were selected for sample collection in April and August. Ruminal fluid was collected and filtered through gauze, which was immediately transferred to liquid nitrogen prior to macrogenomic, 16S rDNA sequencing and metabolomic analyses.</p>",
