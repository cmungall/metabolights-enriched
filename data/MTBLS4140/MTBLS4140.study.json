                "description": "<p>Gut microbes have been recognized to convert the human bile acids by deconjugation, dehydroxylation, dehydrogenation and epimerization of the cholesterol core, but the ability to re-conjugate them with amino acids as an additional conversion has only been recently described. These new bile acids are known as microbially conjugated bile acids (MCBAs). The aim of this study was evaluating the MCBAs diversity produced by the gut microbiota through a metabolomics approach. In this study, fresh fecal samples from healthy donors were evaluated to explore the re-conjugation of chenodeoxycholic and 3-oxo-chenodeoxycholic acids by the human gut microbiota. No significant differences were found between the conversion trend of both BAs incubations. The <em>in vitro</em> results showed a clear trend to first accumulate the epimer isoursochenodeoxycholic acid, and the dehydroxylated lithocholic acid derivatives in samples incubated with chenodeoxycholic and 3-oxo-chenodeoxycholic acid. Also showed a strong trend for the production of microbially conjugated dehydroxylated bile acids, instead of chenodeoxycholic backbone conjugates. Different molecules and isomers of microbial conjugates with valine and leucine were also identified and confirmed by MS/MS. These results document the gut microbiota capability to produce esters of MCBAs on hydroxyls of the sterol backbone in addition to amides at the C24 acyl site. This study opens a new perspective to study the BAs diversity produced by the human gut microbiota.</p>",

Aliquots of stool samples (10 g) were diluted 1/10 w/v in Nutrients Broth supplemented with 0.05% L-cysteine hydrochloride and homogenized by a stomacher in filter bags. Aliquots of fecal suspensions (50 \u00b5L) were inoculated into 5 mL of fermentation medium anaerobe Wilkins Chaldean containing either 50 \u00b5m of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) or 50 \u00b5m 3-oxo-chenodeoxycholic acid (3-oxo-CDCA). A total of 3 replicate cultures were prepared in parallel from each fecal suspension. And 2 types of fecal control samples were prepared, one then including incubation and without incubation procedure. Fecal sample controls and either CDCA and 3-oxo-CDCA (5 mL) were incubated with fecal microbiota and samples were collected after 5 days of incubation at 37 \u00b0C and extracted with 5 mL of ethyl acetate LC-MS (Scharlau, Barcelona, Spain) using a refrigerated thermoblock shaker (VWR lnternational, LLC, Radnor, PA, USA) at 20 \u00b0C for 10 min at 1500 rpm. Samples were centrifuged at 3500 x g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C. The organic phase was evaporated under reduced pressure in a speed vacuum concentrator (Savant SPD121P, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). All of these procedures were performed at CEBAS-CSIC (Murcia, Spain). Extracts were then transferred to the Department of Food Analysis and Nutrition (University of Chemistry and Technology, Prague) for instrument analysis. Samples were re-dissolved in 500 \u00b5L of methanol, and filtered through a 0.22 \u00b5m PVDF filter (Merck Millipore, Cork, Ireland), and they were diluted 1:2 in methanol before the UPLC-IM-QTOF-MS analysis.</p>",
