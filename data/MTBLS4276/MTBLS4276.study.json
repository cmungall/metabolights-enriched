                "description": "<p>Pathogenic bacteria's metabolic adaptation for survival and proliferation within hosts is a crucial aspect of bacterial pathogenesis. Here, we demonstrate that citrate, the first intermediate of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, plays a key role as a regulator of gene expression in Staphylococcus aureus. We show that citrate activates the transcriptional regulator CcpE and thus modulates the expression of numerous genes involved in key cellular pathways such as central carbon metabolism, iron uptake and the synthesis and export of virulence factors. Citrate can also suppress the transcriptional regulatory activity of ferric uptake regulator. Moreover, we determined that accumulated intracellular citrate, partly through the activation of CcpE, decreases the pathogenic potential of S. aureus in animal infection models. Therefore, citrate plays a pivotal role in coordinating carbon metabolism, iron homeostasis and bacterial pathogenicity at the transcriptional level in S. aureus, going beyond its established role as a TCA cycle intermediate.</p>",

Unless otherwise described, Escherichia coli was grown in Luria Bertani (LB) broth or on LA (LB agar) plates. S. aureus strains were cultivated in Tryptone Soya Broth (TSB) (Oxoid, Catalog no. CM0129) or on TSA plate (Oxoid, Catalog no. CM0131). When necessary, antibiotics were used at the following concentrations for maintaining plasmids: for E. coli, 100 \u03bcg/mL carbenicillin or 50 \u03bcg/mL kanamycin; for S. aureus, 10 \u03bcg/mL erythromycin, 10 \u03bcg/mL chloramphenicol or 10 \u03bcg/mL tetracycline. For routine cultivating, all of the strains were grown aerobically at 37 \u00b0C with shaking at 250 rpm.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Construction of S. aureus null or transposon insertion mutants</strong></p><p>For creating S. aureus gene null mutants, an allelic replacement strategy was employed<strong>[1]</strong>. Generally, polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) were performed to amplify upstream sequences (~1 kb) as well as downstream sequences (~1 kb) of the targeted deletion gene. About 10 ng of both the upstream and downstream products were used as templates for the second round of overlapping PCR, resulting in the upstream + downstream fragment. This fragment was used for recombination with pKOR1, a plasmid which permits rapid cloning via lambda recombination and ccdB selection. Recombination reactions were performed using Gateway cloning kit (Invitrogen, Catalog no. 11789-020). The resulting products were subsequently transformed into E. coli DH5a competent cells (Yeasen Biotech. Co. Ltd., Catalog no. 11802ES80). Correct plasmids were electroporated transformed into S. aureus 4220 strain (restriction minus and modification plus) to modify plasmids. The modified plasmids were subsequently transformed into S. aureus Newman strain. Allelic replacement was performed and the null mutant alleles were verified by PCR and DNA sequencing.</p><p><br></p><p>For the deletion of citZ, the upstream fragment and downstream fragment of intended deletion was amplified from S. aureus Newman genomic DNA using primers citZ-up-F/citZ-up-R and citZ-down-F/citZ-down-R (Table S7), respectively. For the deletion of ccpE, four primer, ccpE-up-F/ccpE-up-R and ccpE-down-F/ccpE-down-R, were used. For the deletion of sbnG, primers sbnG-up-F/sbnG-up-R and sbnG-down-F/sbnG-down-R were used. For the deletion of pycA, primers pycA-up-F/pycA-up-R and pycA-down-F/pycA-down-R were used. For the deletion of isdC, primers isdC-up-F/isdC-up-R and isdC-down-F/isdC-down-R were used.</p><p><br></p><p>JE2 TncitB (NE861, Catalog no. NR-47404) and JE2 TnsrtB (NE1363, Catalog no. NR-47905) were acquired from the Nebraska transposon mutant library via the Network on Antimicrobial Resistance in S. aureus (http://www.narsa.net). The transposon was inserted 591 bp downstream the translational start site of citB (locus tag: SAUSA300_1246). For JE2 TnsrtB, the transposon was inserted 260 bp downstream the translational start site of srtB (locus tag: SAUSA300_1034). Newman TncitB and Newman TnsrtB mutant were generated by phage transduction<strong>[2]</strong> with \u03a685 phage lysate from JE2 TncitB or JE2 TnsrtB, respectively. To obtain \u0394citZTncitB or \u0394ccpETncitB double mutants, \u0394citZ or \u0394ccpE (either of each was generated by allelic replacement as described above) was used as the recipient, and transduction was performed similarly as described above. All of the mutants were confirmed by PCR and DNA sequencing.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Metabolomic analysis</strong></p><p>Overnight cultures of S.aureus Newman, <em>TncitB-</em>, \u2206<em>citZTncitB</em> and \u2206<em>ccpETncitB</em> strains were adjusted to OD600 = 5.0 and transferred 1:100 into 10 mL fresh TSB medium (in 50 mL tube) with a tube volume to medium volume = 5:1. In total 6 biological replicates were included in each group and all of the sub-cultures were cultivated at 37 \u00b0C with shaking at 250 rpm for 12 h. Bacterial cultures were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 \u00b0C until use. Metabolomic analysis was performed with the assistance of Shanghai Applied Protein Technology Co.

For the multivariate statistical analysis, the MetaboAnalyst (www.metaboanalyst.ca) web-based system was used. After the data was preprocessed by Pareto-scaling, multi-dimensional statistical analysis, including unsupervised principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) were performed. The first principal component of the variable importance in the projection (VIP) was obtained from OPLS-DA to refine the analysis. The metabolites with VIP values \u2265 1 and the variables assessed by Student\u2019s two-tailed t-test with p-value &lt; 0.05 were considered as significantly differential metabolites. Differential metabolites were further identified and validated by databases including Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG, http://www.kegg.jp/) and Human Metabolome Database. Fold-change values of metabolites were calculated by comparing the mean value between each group.
