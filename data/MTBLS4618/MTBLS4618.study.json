All experiments were performed using bacteria in the exponential phase. We used the minimum inhibitory concentration to assess sensitivity to antibiotics.

After normalisation to total peak intensity, the processed data was imported into the web-based <strong>MetaboAnalyst</strong> (<a href='https://www.metaboanalyst.ca/' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>https://www.metaboanalyst.ca/</a>) system for multivariate statistical analysis, followed by <strong>Pareto scaling</strong>, <strong>PCA</strong> and <strong>OPLS-DA</strong>. The significantly different metabolites were determined based on the combination of a statistically significant threshold of <strong>VIP</strong> value obtained from the <strong>OPLS-DA</strong> model and 2-tailed <strong>Student\u2019s t-test (P-value)</strong> on the raw data, and the metabolites with <strong>VIP</strong> values &gt;1.0 and <strong>P</strong> values &lt;0.05 were considered significant.</p><p><br></p><p>For <strong>KEGG</strong> pathway annotation, the metabolites were blasted against the online <strong>Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database</strong> to retrieve their COs and were subsequently mapped to pathways in <strong>KEGG</strong>. The corresponding <strong>KEGG</strong> pathways were extracted. To further explore the impact of differentially expressed metabolites, enrichment analysis was performed. <strong>KEGG</strong> pathway enrichment analyses were applied based on the Fisher exact test, considering the whole metabolites of each pathway as background dataset. And only pathways with p-values under a threshold of 0.05 were considered as significant changed pathways. For hierarchical clustering, <strong>Cluster 3.0</strong> and the <strong>Java Treeview software</strong> were used. Euclidean distance algorithm for similarity measure and average linkage clustering algorithm (clustering uses the centroids of the observations) for clustering were selected when performing hierarchical clustering. A heat map is often presented as a visual aid in addition to the dendrogram.</p>",
