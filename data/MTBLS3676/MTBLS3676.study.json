                "description": "Deploying toxins in complex mixtures is thought to be advantageous and is observed during antagonistic interactions in nature. Toxin mixtures are widely utilized in medicine and pest control, as they are thought to slow the evolution of detoxification counterresponses in the targeted organisms. Here we show that caterpillars rearrange key constituents of two distinct plant defense pathways to postingestively disable the defensive properties of both pathways. Specifically, phenolic esters of quinic acid, chlorogenic acids (CAs), potent herbivore and ultraviolet (UV) defenses, are reesterified to decorate particular sugars of 17-hydroxygeranyllinalool diterpene glycosides (HGL-DTGs) and prevent their respective anti\u2013herbivore defense functions. This was discovered through the employment of comparative metabolomics of the leaves of Nicotiana attenuata and the frass of this native tobacco\u2019s specialist herbivore, Manduca sexta larvae. Feeding caterpillars on leaves of transgenic plants abrogated in each of the two pathways, separately and together, revealed that one of the fully characterized frass conjugates, caffeoylated HGL-DTG, originated from ingested CA and HGL-DTGs and that both had negative effects on the defensive function of the other compound class, as revealed by rates of larval mass gain. This negative defensive synergy was further explored in 183 N. attenuata natural accessions, which revealed a strong negative covariance between the two defense pathways. Further mapping analyses in a biparental recombinant inbred line (RIL) population imputed quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for the two pathways at distinct genomic locations. The postingestive repurposing of defense metabolism constituents reveals a downside of deploying toxins in mixtures, a downside which plants in nature have evolved to counter.",

                        "description": "<p><strong>Plants and growth conditions </strong></p><p>The 31st inbred generation of<strong> N. attenuata </strong>was used as<strong> wild type (WT)</strong> Ut genotype plants. Seeds were germinated on a mixture of plant agar with Gamborg\u2019s B5 medium in sterile petri dishes and seedlings were transferred to pots and grown under 19-35 \u00b0C, 16 h light (supplemental lighting by Philips Sun-T Agro 400W and 600W sodium lights) and 60-65% relative humidity as previously described<strong>[1]</strong>. Stably transformed and fully characterized RNAi plants, including irUGT91T1 (A-11-538-05<strong>[2]</strong>), irUGT74P5 (A-11-544-11<strong>[2]</strong>), irUGT74_3&amp;5 (A-12-076-07<strong>[2]</strong>), irGGPPS (A-08-230-5<strong>[3]</strong>), irHQT (A-14-153-6<strong>[4]</strong> and irMYB8 (A-07-810<strong>[5]</strong>), were germinated and grown under glasshouse conditions. Hemizygous 'cross' plants were produced by crossing the homozygous irGGPPS and irHQT in both parental directions. Hemizygous irGGPPS and irHQT were produced by crossing the homozygous irGGPPS and irHQT with empty vector (EV, A-03-009-1). The VIGS procedure was used with Ut WT plants and Az plants of the 22nd generation<strong>[6][7]</strong>. Briefly, leaves of young rosette-stage plants were pressure infiltrated with a mixture of Agrobacterium tumefaciens containing pBINTRA and either pTV-Myb308 or pTV00 (EV control). The VIGS experiment for NaCYP736A on empty vector (EV) or irGGPPS plants<strong>[8]</strong>. VIGS experiments were repeated at least 3x times.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>M. sexta growth conditions and performance assays</strong></p><p><strong>M. sexta</strong> eggs were obtained from an in-house colony in which insects are reared in a growth chamber (Snijders Scientific, Tilburg, Netherlands) at 26 \u00b0C:16 h light and 24 \u00b0C:8 h dark, 65% relative humidity, until hatching. To measure the performance of <strong>M. sexta</strong> larvae on plants (<strong>EV, irHQT, irGGPPS </strong>and<strong> Cross</strong>), a single newly hatched neonate was introduced onto the first stem leaf of each early elongated N. attenuata plant and allowed to feed freely. The larvae were weighed 4 days after release. Artificial diet (AD) assays were performed in plastic PE-packing cups containing AD based on the recipes published<strong>[9]</strong>. Additionally, neonates were fed AD containing 2 mg/g FW purified HGL-DTGs (aqueous in 5 mL), 3.4 \u00b5mol/g FW CA (aqueous in 5 mL), a combination of 2 mg/g FW HGL-DTGs and 3.4 \u00b5mol/g FW CA. The AD was changed with fresh diet after each weighing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Frass collection</strong></p><p>In total 2 freshly hatched neonates of <strong>M. sexta</strong> were reared on the first fully elongated stem leaf (S1; younger leaves are subsequently labelled S2, S3, S4 proceeding up the main stalk) of transgenic 43 day old flowering<strong> N. attenuata </strong>plants and retained on the S1 leaf with clip cages for 3 days. Approximately, 10-20 mg of <strong>frass </strong>was either collected from the top of the leaves with forceps or from the bottom of the clip cage. <strong>Frass </strong>from ADs was collected using forceps from the PE-packing cups. All materials were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 \u00b0C until use. In general, <strong>frass </strong>was collected from caterpillar while they were in the <strong>1st-3rd instars</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1] </strong>Kr\u00fcgel T, Lim M, Gase K, Halitschke R, Baldwin IT.

It includes a detailed rule-set for the annotation of fragmentation patterns of the different moieties decorating the 17-hydroxygeranyllinalool (17-HGL) aglycone. To visualize HGL-DTG profiles, we computed the extracted ion chromatogram (EIC) of m/z 271.2420, which corresponds to the 17- HGL aglycone fragment lacking both hydroxyl groups at the C-3 and C-17 positions. The definition of malonylated HGL-DTGs or 'core' HGL-DTGs is based on whether the compounds contain malonyl moieties (21). The identification levels are based on community standards reported<strong>[2]</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Heiling S, Khanal S, Barsch A, Zurek G, Baldwin IT, Gaquerel E.
