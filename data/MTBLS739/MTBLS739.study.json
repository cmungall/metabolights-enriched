                "description": "<div><b>OBJECTIVE:</b> Atherosclerotic plaque development is closely associated with the hemodynamic forces applied to endothelial cells (EC). Among these, shear stress (SS) plays a key role in disease development since changes in flow intensity and direction could stimulate an atheroprone or atheroprotective phenotype. EC under low or oscillatory SS (LSS) shows upregulation of inflammatory, adhesion and cellular permeability molecules. On the contrary, cells under high or laminar SS (HSS) increase their expression of protective and anti-inflammatory factors. The mechanism behind SS regulation of an atheroprotective phenotype is not completely elucidated.</div><div><b>APPROACH and RESULTS:</b> Here we used proteomics and metabolomics to better understand the changes in endothelial cells (HUVECs) under in vitro LSS and HSS that promote an atheroprone or atheroprotective profile and how these modifications can be connected to atherosclerosis development. Our data showed that lipid metabolism, in special cholesterol metabolism, was downregulated in cells under LSS. The LDLR showed significant alterations both at the quantitative expression level, as well as regarding post-translational modifications. Under LSS, LDLR was seen at lower concentrations and with a different glycosylation profile. Finally, modulating LDLR with atorvastatin led to the recapitulation of a HSS metabolic phenotype in EC under LSS.</div><div><b>CONCLUSIONS:</b> Altogether, our data suggest that there is significant modulation of lipid metabolism in endothelial cells under different SS intensities and that this could contribute to the atheroprone phenotype of LSS. Statin treatment was able to partially recover the protective profile of these cells.</div>",

RT penalty function was set as Trapezoidal in RT range of 30 s with Penalty-free RT range of 10 s. Minimum match factor applied was 60. The metabolites that were not identified in the Agilent Fiehn GC/MS Metabolomics RTL Library were searched in the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) library 11 (2014) using Unknowns - Agilent MassHunter Workstation Quantitative Analysis (version B.06.00).\n</br></br>\nData consistency was checked based on the identification of Internal Standard (myristic acid d27) among samples, identification of each metabolite in at least 2 of 3 technical replicates and a coefficient variation of metabolites intensity lower than 30% among the 3 technical replicates. Only metabolites that were present in at least 50% of samples from 1 group (LSS, HSS or LSS with statin) were submitted to statistical analysis. Metabolites were analyzed using the MetaboAnalyst online platform[1]. Missing values were substituted by the half of lower value in the table and data was normalized using auto-scaling method. Metabolite intensities were log2 transformed and an ANOVA test was performed with Fisher's Least Significant Difference (LSD) as post hoc test. The metabolites that were different between groups were analyzed by principal component analysis (PCA).\n</br></br>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Xia J, Sinelnikov IV, Han B, Wishart DS.
