                "description": "<p><strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong> Neuronal activity regulated by synaptic communication exerts an important role in tumorigenesis and progression in brain tumors. Genes for soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (SNAREs) annotated with the function \u2018vesicle\u2019 about synaptic connectivity were identified and one of these proteins, synaptosomal-associated protein 25 (SNAP25), was found to have discrepant expression levels in neuropathies. However, the specific mechanism and prognostic value of SNAP25 during glioma progression remain unclear.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>METHODS:</strong> Using RNA sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, the differential synaptosis-related genes between LGG and GBM were identified as highly correlated. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis and survival analysis indicated that the candidate gene SNAP25 could differentiate the outcome of low- and high-risk patients, and the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) cohort was used for validation of the data set. RT-qPCR, western blot, and immunohistochemistry assays were performed to examine the expression level of SNAP25 in glioma cells and samples. Functional assays were performed to identify the effects of SNAP25 knockdown and overexpression on cell viability, migration, and invasion. Then, an immunofluorescence assay of the xenograft tissue was applied to evaluate the expression of the neuronal dendron formation marker-MAP2. Liquid chromatography-high re solution mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomics approach was presented for identifying crucial metabolic disturbances in glioma cells. In situ mouse xenograft model was used to investigate the role of SNAP25 in vivo.</p><p><strong>RESULTS:</strong> SNAP25 was down expressed in glioma tissues and cell lines and low-level SNAP25 indicated an unfavorable prognosis of glioma patients. SNAP25 inhibited cell proliferation, migration, invasion and fostered glutamate metabolism of glioma cells, exerting a tumor suppressor role. SNAP25 overexpression expressed lower expression of MAP2, indicating poor neuronal plasticity and connectivity. SNAP25 could interact with glutaminase\uff08GLS\uff09and GLS knockdown could rescue the anti-tumor effect of SNAP25 in glioma cells. Moreover, upregulation of SNAP25 also decreased tumor volume and prolonged the overall survival (OS) of the xenograft mouse.</p><p><strong>CONCLUSION:</strong> SNAP25 inhibited carcinogenesis of glioma via sponging glutamate metabolism by regulating GLS expression, as well as inhibiting dendritic formation, which could be considered as a molecular target for glioma diagnosis and therapy.</p>",

These glioma specimens include 16 Grade IV (GBM), 14 Grade III, 8 Grade II, and 2 Grade I astrocytoma cases, and the histologic features of surgical resection specimens were independently examined by two neuropathologists according to the WHO criteria (see <strong>Table S1</strong> in the paper associated with this study). The specimens were frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately after the surgery and then paraffin embedded for long time preservation. The project protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Zhujiang Hospital and written informed consents were obtained from all patients enrolled in this study.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Cell culture:</strong></p><p>The human GBM cell lines (U87, U251, A172, U118) were purchased from the Cell Bank of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China), and were authenticated and examined for mycoplasma contamination.

U87MG-mCherry(U87MC) glioma cell line labelled with red fluorescent protein were kindly provided by the Ke Yichuan\u2019s lab of South medical university.

After successful transfection, the qRT-PCR assay were applied to evaluate the SNAP25 gene expression rate of the glioma cells (A172), and only the cells with high transfected effect and high viability of samples were selected.</p><p><br></p><p>The samples were prepared by treating the well cultured cells with 70% methanol at 4 \u00b0C. The cells were scratched and collected into a 15-ml centrifuge tube and then spun at 1000 rpm, 4 \u00b0C for 10 min. The supernatant was discarded and the cell pellet was rinsed with PBS at 4 \u00b0C. The spinning and discarding was then repeated a further 3x. The cell pellet was then collected and stored under nitrogen.</p>",
