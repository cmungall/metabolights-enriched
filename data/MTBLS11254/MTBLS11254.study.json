                "description": "Metabolic reprogramming fuels cancer cell metastasis and remodels the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). We report here that a circRNA, circPETH, packaged by extracellular vesicles (EVs) from tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, facilitates glycolysis and metastasis of recipient HCC cells. Mechanistically, circPETH-147aa, encoded by circPETH in a m6A-driven manner, promotes PKM2-catalyzed ALDOA-S36 phosphorylation via MEG pocket. Furthermore, circPETH-147aa impairs anti-HCC immunity by elevating HuR-dependent SLC43A2 mRNA stability and driving methionine and leucine deficiency in cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. Importantly, by virtual and experimental screening, we found that the novel small-molecule Norathyriol was an effective inhibitor that targets the MEG pocket on circPETH-147aa surface. Norathyriol reverses circPETH-147aa-facilitated acquisition of metabolic and metastatic phenotypes by HCC cells, increases anti-PD1 efficacy and boosts cytotoxic CD8+ T-cell function. Our findings determine Norathyriol as a promising anti-HCC agent that contributes to the attenuation of advanced HCC resistance to immune checkpoint blocker (ICB) therapies.",

                        "description": "<p>MWDB (Metware Database) is constructed based on standard products, and qualitative analysis of mass spectrometry data is carried out.</p><p>Quantification was performed using Multiple Reaction Monitoring (MRM) analysis using triple quadrupole mass spectrometry. In the MRM model, the four-pole first screens the precursor ions (parent ions) of the target substance, and excludes the ions corresponding to other molecular weight substances to preliminarily eliminate the interference. After ionization induced by the collision chamber, the precursor ions break to form a number of fragment ions, and then the fragment ions are filtered through the triple four-pole to select the required characteristic fragment ions, and eliminate the interference of non-target ions, so that the quantification is more accurate and the repeatability is better. After the mass spectrometry data of different samples were obtained, the chromatographic peaks of all target objects were integrated and quantitative analysis was performed by standard curves.</p>",
