                "description": "<p><strong>INTRODUCTION: </strong>Bitter melon (Momordica charantia, Cucurbitaceae) is a popular edible medicinal plant, which has been used as a botanical dietary supplement for the treatment of diabetes and obesity in Chinese folk medicine. Previously, our team has proved that cucurbitanes triterpenoid were involved in bitter melon's anti-diabetic effects as well as on increasing energy expenditure. The triterpenoids composition can however be influenced by changes of varieties or habitats.</p><p><strong>OBJECTIVES:</strong> To clarify the significance of bioactive metabolites diversity among different bitter melons and to provide a guideline for selection of bitter melon varieties, an exploratory study was carried out using a UHPLC-HRMS based metabolomic study to identify chemotypes.</p><p><strong>METHODS:</strong> Metabolites of 55 seed samples of bitter melon collected in different parts of China were profiled by UHPLC-HRMS. The profiling data were analysed with multivariate (MVA) statistical methods. Principle component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) were applied for sample differentiation. Marker compounds were identified by comparing spectroscopic data with isolated compounds, and additional triterpenes were putatively identified by propagating annotations through a molecular network (MN) generated from UHPLC-HRMS &amp; MS/MS metabolite profiling.</p><p><strong>RESULTS:</strong> PCA and HCA provided a good discrimination between bitter melon samples from various origins in China. This study revealed for the first time the existence of two chemotypes of bitter melon. Marker compounds of those two chemotypes were identified at different MSI levels. The combined results of MN and MVA demonstrated that the two chemotypes mainly differ in their richness in cucurbitane versus oleanane triterpenoid glycosides (CTGs vs. OTGs).</p><p><strong>CONCLUSION:</strong> Our finding revealed a clear chemotype distribution of bioactive components across bitter melon varieties. While bioactivities of individual CTGs and OTGs still need to be investigated in more depth, our results could help in future the selection of bitter melon varieties with optimised metabolites profile for an improved management of diabetes with this popular edible Chinese folk medicine.</p>",

The peak detection was performed using 2D Grid Mass algorithm using following parameters: minimum height 100, m/z tolerance 0.06, min\u2013max width time 0.03\u20130.4. Isotopic peaks grouping was using m/z tolerance 0.05, max charge 2 and representative isotope with lowest m/z. RANSAC aligner was applied using 50% min number of points and threshold 0.05. Duplicate peak filter and peak finder gap filling were applied then and a peak list of 511 x 55 matrix was obtained.\n</br></br>\nThe matrix was normalized and then imported to SIMCA 13.0 (Umetrics, Sweden) and pretreated with mean-centered and Pareto variance scaling. A PCA model was generated with the data matrix. A Hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) was performed using PCA algorithm but with > 95% (R2X = 0.952, 20 PCs) information of original feature of samples.\n</br></br>\nPotential markers were selected using a PCA 'group to group comparison' scores contribution plot. A threshold score > 1.2 was applied to select variables that contributed to the differences between the two groups. Isotopes and adducts were removed manually from the final marker list by checking UHPLC-MS raw data.\n</br></br>\nHeat-maps were created using MeV 4.9.0. The data set was processed following normalization, divided by SD and mean-centered. Hierarchical clustering analysis was performed based on Euclidean distance.\n</br></br>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Pluskal T, Castillo S, Villar-Briones A, Oresic M.

This included 2 OTGs (A9 goyasaponin I and A11 goyasaponin II) for CA and 4 CTGs (B2 momordicoside S, B3 momordicoside T, B5 momordicoside A and B9 momordicoside B) for CB. However, this was not sufficient for a comprehensive survey of all compounds responsible for the differences between bitter melon chemotypes. In order to annotate the largest possible number of marker compounds, MS/MS spectra of the pool of all samples and a mixture of references were recorded by Orbitrap with a similar UHPLC gradient and processed by molecular networking (MN) analysis[4] by global natural products social (GNPS, http://gnps.ucsd.edu) online workflow[4] with the following parameters: precursor ion mass tolerance, 1.0 Da; MS/MS fragment ion mass tolerance, 0.8 Da. Filters were applied to remove all edges which cosine score was below 0.7 and match fragment peaks < 6. The maximum number of neighbor nodes for one single node was set to 10. The final results were visualized both online at GNPS and using Cytoscape 3.4.0. All self-loops were removed at the data import step.\n</br></br>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Okabe H, Miyahara Y, Yamauchi T, Miyahara K, Kawasaki T. (1980). Studies on the constituents of Momordica charantia L.
