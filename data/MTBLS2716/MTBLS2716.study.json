                "description": "<p>Environmental exposure to xenoestrogens, i.e., chemicals that imitate the hormone 17\u03b2-estradiol, has the potential to influence hormone homeostasis and action. Detailed knowledge of xenobiotic biotransformation processes in cell models is key when transferring knowledge learned from <em>in vitro</em> models to <em>in vivo</em> relevance. This study elucidated the metabolism of two naturally-occurring phyto- and myco-estrogens; namely genistein and zearalenone, in an estrogen receptor positive breast cancer cell line (MCF-7) with the aid of stable isotope-assisted metabolomics and the bioinformatic tool MetExtract II. Metabolism was studied in a time course experiment after 2, 6&nbsp;and 24&nbsp;h incubation. Twelve and six biotransformation products of zearalenone and genistein were detected, respectively, clearly demonstrating the abundant xenobiotic biotransformation capability of the cells. Zearalenone underwent extensive phase-I metabolism resulting in \u03b1-zearalenol (\u03b1-ZEL), a molecule known to possess a significantly higher estrogenicity, and several phase-II metabolites (sulfo- and glyco-conjugates) of the native compound and the major phase I metabolite \u03b1-ZEL. Moreover, potential adducts of zearalenone with a vitamin and several hydroxylated metabolites were annotated. Genistein metabolism resulted in sulfation, combined sulfation and hydroxylation, acetylation, glucuronidation and unexpectedly adduct formation with pentose- and hexose-sugars. Kinetics of metabolite formation and subsequent excretion into the extracellular medium revealed a time-dependent increase in most biotransformation products. The untargeted elucidation of biotransformation products formed during cell culture experiments enables an improved and more meaningful interpretation of toxicological assays and has the potential to identify unexpected or unknown metabolites.</p>",

The cells were cultivated in growth medium consisting of Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Medium F-12 Nutrient Mixture, 10% heat-inactivated calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (50 U/mL). Prior to the experiments, the cells were routinely split twice a week and maintained in T-175 flasks at a confluence of between 75-85%. For sub-culturing, the cells were washed with PBS, detached with trypsin/EDTA, and re-suspended in fresh culture medium. The experiments were conducted on the cells during passages 7-9 and cells were routinely maintained at 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO2 and 95% humidity.</p><p><br></p><p>For the experiments, 400,000 cells per well were seeded in 6-well plates. After 48, 66 and 70 h of proliferation, the cells were incubated with 3 mL fresh incubation media containing equimolar amounts of the labeled and non-labeled compound (each 5 \u00b5M ZEN/13C-ZEN or GEN/2H4-GEN) corresponding to incubation times of 24, 6 and 2 h, respectively.&nbsp;The procedure ensured identical cell harvest and extraction after 72 h for all time points. In control experiments, the cells were incubated with fresh medium containing 0.1% DMSO without the xenobiotics and harvested after 72 h. In a second control experiment, cell culture medium was incubated without cells under the same conditions. All experiments were performed in triplicate.</p>",

To collect the supernatant, 0.5 mL of the medium were transferred into reactions tubes and 1 mL of chilled methanol was added. Subsequently, the tubes were vortexed and centrifuged for 5 min at 4 \u00b0C and 18,000 x g. A volume of 0.5 mL of the supernatant was transferred to LC-vials and mixed with 0.5 mL water to reach a final dilution of 1+5 (v/v). Cell lysates were harvested after the remaining medium was removed using a vacuum pump. The cells were washed twice with 1 mL of ice-cold PBS and 0.7 mL quenching solution (ice-cold MeOH/water, 80/20, v/v) were added. The cells were detached using a cell scraper and the cell suspension was transferred to reaction tubes. Thereafter, the wells were washed with an additional 0.3 mL of quenching solution, which was combined with the cell suspension. Samples were vortexed followed by 3 cycles of shock freezing in liquid nitrogen and thawing at room temperature. Thereafter, the samples were again mixed thoroughly and centrifuged for 10 min (18,000 x g, 4 \u00b0C).

With the purpose of detecting ion pairs of native and 2H- or 13C-labeled biotransformation products of (2H4-) GEN and (13C18-) ZEN, data processing was performed by MetExtract II<strong>[2]</strong>. Briefly summarized, the algorithm searched for MS signal pairs of native and 2H- or 13C-labeled metabolites in each recorded MS scan (\u0394m/z for 2H: 1.00627; \u0394m/z for 13C: 1.00335; minimum abundance: 10,000 (ZEN)/5,000 (GEN); maximum m/z deviation: 3 ppm; ratio of monoisotopic and 13C-isotopologue MS signals: 0.5-2; ratio of monoisotopic and 2H- isotopologue MS signals: not assessed; searched 2H-isotopes: 2-4; searched 13C-isotopes: 12-18. Subsequently, detected ion pairs of all putative biotransformation products were binned using hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA; distance method: Euclidean distance; linkage method: average). For each bin (minimum number of MS signal pairs: 2; maximum allowed m/z deviation: 8 ppm), the EICs (extracted ion chromatogram) of the native and the 2H- or 13C-labeled ions were calculated (EIC window: \u00b1 5 ppm) and separately inspected for presence/absence of the chromatographic peaks. Pairs of co-eluting chromatographic peaks that were apparent in both EICs at approximately the same retention time (maximum deviation: \u00b1 10 scans) were retained. Furthermore, the profiles of co-eluting chromatographic peak pairs were compared using the Pearson correlation coefficient (minimum correlation coefficient for the native and 13C-labeled ions: 0.5; minimum correlation for the native and 2H-labeled ions: 0). All chromatographic peak pairs were further convoluted into feature groups by comparing the peak shape of the native, monoisotopic ions (maximum deviation: \u00b1 10 scans; minimum correlation coefficient: 0.85). Subsequently, detected ions and convoluted metabolites were bracketed across all LC-HRMS data files (maximum m/z deviation: 6 ppm; maximum retention time deviation: 0.2 min). These automatically-processed results were manually inspected, verified, and putative false positives were discarded.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> (Kessner et al. 2008)</p><p><strong>[2]</strong> (Bueschl et al. 2017)</p>",

                        "description": "<p>To annotate biotransformation products, the masses of interest from the MetExtract II processing were initially compared to authentic reference standards of known biotransformation products including several ZEN metabolites. Furthermore, a literature search for additional conjugates was performed and matched with the potential masses of metabolic products. Based on known biotransformation reactions, the mass difference of the measured m/z value and the intact compound (ZEN or GEN) was then calculated and searched in databases including mzCloud and METLIN to identify potential xenoestrogen conjugates. Despite only one part of the structure of GEN, i.e., the phenyl-ring, containing heavy, deuterated atoms (n=4); an intact molecule was assumed for calculations when the MetExtract II algorithm revealed a mass difference corresponding to all four deuterium atoms. For ZEN and GEN, the evaluation focused on feature pairs with a mass difference of 18 13C (\u0394m/z 18.0603) and 4 2H (\u0394m/z 4.0251), respectively, indicative of an intact structure. When successfully acquired, MS2 spectra were evaluated and compared to databases and literature reports.</p><p>For many known ZEN metabolites, authentic standards were available. To differentiate isomers with the same exact mass, individual standards of \u03b1-ZEL, \u03b1-ZAL and \u03b1-ZEL-sulfate were measured in addition to the multi-analyte standard distinguishing them from their \u03b2-forms </p>",
