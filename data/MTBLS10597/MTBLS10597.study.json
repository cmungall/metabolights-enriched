                "description": "<p>The Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) is a retrograde, ER-to-nucleus, signalling pathway which is conserved across kingdoms. In plants, it contributes to development, reproduction, immunity and tolerance to abiotic stress. This lipidomic dataset was produced from Arabidopsis thaliana mature seeds. Wild-type (WT) and mutant deficient for UPR actors (bzip60, ire1a and ire1b single mutants, as well as double ire1 mutants) were used as genetic backgrounds to investigate whether UPR controls lipid seed filling in Arabidopsis thaliana. Our experimental setup also allows to distinguish among differentially-overaccumulated lipids which ones are dependent on IRE1s and/or bZIP60.</p>",

To get seeds, plants from all genotypes were simultaneously grown in green house for 10 wk. Seeds were then harvested and dried at 50 \u00b0C for 2 days. Seed lots were stored at 4 \u00b0C under low humidity until use. One seed lot harvested from one plant correspond to one biological replicate.

A volume of 333 \u00b5L chloroform wad added to each sample, and they were incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Then, 333 \u00b5L of chloroform and 333 \u00b5L of water were added to each tube and thoroughly shacked, before centrifugation for 10 min at 10.000 x g. The lower non polar phase was recovered and, lipids were re-extracted from the upper aqueous phase following the same procedure using 333 \u00b5L of chloroform and 333 \u00b5L of water. Non polar phases were pooled, and dried under gaseous nitrogen flux. Dry residues were resuspended in 250 \u00b5L of acetonitrile/isopropanol (7/3, v/v) before injection.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Bligh, E.G, Dyer, W.J. 1959.

Then, isotopic peak grouper algorithm was used with a m/z tolerance of 10 ppm and RT tolerance of 0.2 min. All the peaks were filtered using feature list row filter keeping only peaks with MS2 scan. The alignment of samples was performed using the join aligner with an m/z tolerance of 10 ppm, a weight for m/z and RT at 1.0, a retention time tolerance of 0.2 min.
