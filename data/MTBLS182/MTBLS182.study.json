                "description": "MS and NMR are two of the most powerful spectroscopic techniques used in the field of fluxomics, to analyze the flux distributions in cellular metabolomic pathways. Both of them possess pros and cons, such as, MS being the most sensitive and low-cost technique, while needs extensive sample processing and providing incomplete labeling data, whereas NMR needs lesser sample preparation and provides more detailed labeling data, while being less sensitive and expensive. Since both techniques could be viewed as complementary to each other, combining their data could yield a detailed and complete information about a system under study. In this case, samples were generated from a single experiment and the same set of samples was used both in MS and 1D NMR to analyze the 13C label distributions in TCA cycle intermediates. The data generated from both methods were used with a simulation script that was developed to integrate the MS and NMR data. MCF-7 breast cancer cell line was used as an experimental model and it was incubated with 100% [1,2-13C]-glucose and 100% [U-13C]-glucose for 8 hours. The cells, before and after incubation with tracers, were frozen in liquid nitrogen and then later processed for extracting the TCA cycle intermediates. Same set of samples were separated for GC-MS and NMR based analysis and processed for the respective techniques. The isotopologue analysis was performed by GC-MS and the isotopomer analysis was performed by NMR and both sets of data were integrated with the simulation software. This study contains the data for GC-MS analysis. </br></br> The NMR assay for this study can be found in the MetaboLights study MTBLS241.</br> <br/>Linked Studies: <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS241' target='_blank'><span class='label label-success'>MTBLS241</span></a>",

The medium used was basal medium DMEM (A14430, Invitrogen) with 10% dialyzed FBS (F0392, Sigma), 0.01 mg/ml Insulin (19278, Sigma), 1% Non-Essential Amino acids (01-340-1B, Biological Industries), 10 mM glucose (G8769, Sigma) and 4 mM Glutamine (25030-81, Life Technologies).\n</p>\nAfter 48 h of cell seeding, media was removed and plates were washed twice with PBS. 6 ml of fresh media containing tracers were added to each plate. The conditions used in this experiment were cold natural samples with [U-12C]-glucose (unlabeled glucose) (A), samples with tracer [U-13C6]-glucose (B) and samples with tracer [1,2-13C2]-glucose (C), amounting to 10 mM of glucose in each case.

This process was followed with the 6 plates of the same replicate. After scraping the 6th plate, all the content was transferred to a glass tube, where 2 ml of cold chloroform was added. Tubes were vigorously agitated for 30 min at 4 \u00baC. After agitation, 1/6 part of the content of the tube was transferred to a separate tube. The tube containing the 1/6 part was used for GC/MS analysis and the tube containing the 5/6 part was used for NMR analysis.\n</p>\nNext, tubes were centrifuged and the upper phase containing the polar metabolites was transferred to a separate glass tube.

In brief, the areas of peaks for all ions in the cluster were extracted from raw data using equipment software. A value of each peak area is proportional to the fraction of ions with the same molecular weight. These data obtained represents the distribution of ions of various molecular weights that belong to the same compound or its fragment. Ions of various molecular weights are produced as a result of experimental isotope incorporation, the presence of isotopes in heteroatoms and the presence of natural abundance of 13C in the background. Also, derivatizing reagents often contain isotopes which contribute to the isotopologue distribution of the derivatized compound as well. Correction for all such contributions is necessary before one can determine the amount of isotope incorporation from artificially 13C labeled substrates and the distribution of isotopologues in the compound of interest. This correction was performed by using regression analysis using an in-house developed algorithm (R-mass).",
