                "description": "Powerful data pretreatment strategies inspired from the field of metabolomics were adapted to chemical food safety context to enable samples discrimination by multivariate methods based on low abundance ions. A highly automated workflow was produced. The open-source XCMS package was used and efficient data filtration strategies were set up. Data were treated using Independent Components Analysis, and data mining strategies developed to automatically detect and annotate ions of low abundance by coupling blind data exploration strategies with a broad scale database approach. Our method was efficient in discriminating tea samples based on their contamination levels (even at 10\u00b5g/kg) and detecting unexpected impurities in the spiking mix. Several \u201ctracer\u201d contaminants were considered, covering a broad range of physicochemical properties and structural diversity with overall 66% detected and annotated blindly. The methodology was successfully applied to a data set exhibiting only 3 \u201ctracer\u201d contaminants (at 50\u00b5g/kg) and more product diversity. </br></br> Dataset 1 with 1 tea spiked with 32 contaminants and referred to as the Development dataset is reported in the current study MTBLS752. </br> Dataset 2 with 2 teas spiked with 3 contaminants and referred to as the Validation dataset is reported in MTBLS754. </br><br/> Linked Studies: <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS754' target='_blank'><span class='label label-success'>MTBLS754</span></a>",

Green tea n\u00b01 is a Japanese Bancha tea, and green tea n\u00b02 is a Chinese tea. They were used to generate the development data set (green tea n\u00b01) and the validation data set (green teas n\u00b01 & 2).\n</p>\n2 spiking mixes were prepared. The first one (mix n\u00b01), intended for the development data set, consists of a pool of 32 chemical contaminants (a detailed list of compounds used can be found in Table S1 in the paper associated with this study). These target molecules, called \u201ctracers\u201d, were chosen to be representative of potential contaminants, both in terms of chemical structures, source types (mycotoxins, pesticides, process-induced toxicants and migrants from packaging) and analytical behavior (instrumental response, peak width, retention time and adduct/isotopic information). The second one (mix n\u00b02) consists of 3 selected contaminants from the previous list, chosen for their chemical diversity, namely ochratoxin A (OTA), bisphenol S (BPS) and tolfenpyrad.\n</p>\nFor the development data set, 4 samples from green tea n\u00b01 (Bancha type, gross, Japan) were used (each time 3 sub-samples were collected to obtain triplicates of preparation). 3 of these samples were spiked with mix n\u00b01 at 10, 50 or 100 \u00b5g/kg, and the remaining sample, spiked only with acetonitrile (ACN) solvent, as a control.",

The supernatant was then collected and an aliquot (1 ml) was evaporated to dryness under a gentle stream of nitrogen. The extract was further reconstituted in 0.2 ml of ACN acidified with 0.1% FA. Then 0.8 ml of ultrapure water with 0.1% FA was added in order to reconstitute 1 ml of final volume, and centrifuged at 12,000 x g for 10 min. At the end, 0.5 ml of the final extract was sampled and filtered at 0.2 \u00b5m using a syringeless filter vial (mini-uniprep G2, Whatman) before analysis. A Quality Control (QC) sample for each data set was prepared by pooling together 0.2 ml of final extract from every sample of the set; an aliquot of 0.5 ml was then taken and filtrated at 0.2 \u00b5m using a syringeless filter vial.",

                        "description": "Analyzes were performed on a Waters Acquity UPLC H-Class system, composed of a quaternary solvent manager pump, a refrigerated sample manager Flow-Through-Needle and a column oven, coupled to a Waters high resolution Time-of-Flight mass spectrometer Xevo G2-S ToF operated in centroid mode (UHPLC/HRMS-ToF). Separation was performed on a C18-PFP column (150 x 2.1 mm, 2 \u00b5m particles diameter, ACE supplied by AIT France). An electrospray ionization source was used in both positive (ESI+) and negative (ESI-) modes. ESI+ and ESI- modes were run separately. For ESI+, the mobile phase was composed of water (A) and ACN (B), both acidified with 0.1% FA, and MeOH (C), flowing at 0.4 ml/min. Gradient started at 100% A and reached 100% B in 10 min, being kept for 6 min before switching to 100% C to rinse the system in 1 min, being hold for 5 min, returning back to 100% A in 1 min and finally equilibrating for 3 min, with a total run duration of 26 min. For ESI-, the mobile phase was composed of water buffered at pH 6.45 with 10 mM of ammonium formate (A) and MeOH (B) flowing at 0.3 ml/min. The gradient started at 100% A and reached 100% B in 13 min, holding this condition for 7 min before turning back to 100% A in 1 min and finally equilibrating for 3 min, with a total run duration of 24 min. For both chromatographic methods the temperature of the column oven was kept at 30 \u00b0C.\n</p>\nThe analytical sequence started with injection of 10 mobile phase blanks in order to reach complete equilibrium of UHPLC-HRMS-ToF apparatus. Sample vials were randomized in the analytical sequence, and a blank as well as a QC sample were injected every 10 sample vials. For each ionization mode, all sub-samples were injected either in triplicate (development data set) or in quadruplicate (validation data set).",

Peak were detected using centWave algorithm of XCMS and the following parameters were employed: ppm=15; peakwidth=5-60; minfrac=0.5; bw=2; mzwid=0.015. After peak picking, data was imported in Matlab and peaks were first filtered using univariate statistical tests (student tests) and fold change determination. Peaks already present in blank injections (p-value<0.05 for t-test between sample groups and blank injections) were discarded, and only peaks exhibiting high contrast between sample groups were kept (p-value<0.05 for pairwise t-test between sample groups and fold change>2). Reduced data matrix was then log- and pareto-scaled and normalized using PQN (Probabilistic Quotient Normalization) before multivariate analysis with Independent Components Analysis (ICA). Thanks to ICA, data were visualized and discriminating peaks extracted and annotated with the help of a data base search and an isotopic pattern detection based on the a previously published approach[3].\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Giacomoni, F. et al.
