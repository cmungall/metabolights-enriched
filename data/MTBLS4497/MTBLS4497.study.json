                "description": "<p>Macrophages are prominent immune cells in the tumor microenvironment that can be educated into pro-tumoral phenotype by tumor cells to favor tumor growth and metastasis. The mechanisms that mediate a mutualistic relationship between tumor cells and macrophages remain poorly characterized. Here, we have shown <em>in vitro</em> that different human and murine cancer cell lines release branched\u2010chain \u03b1\u2010ketoacids (BCKAs) into the extracellular milieu, which influence macrophage polarization in an monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1)\u2010dependent manner. We found that \u03b1\u2010ketoisocaproate (KIC) and \u03b1\u2010keto\u2010\u03b2\u2010methylvalerate (KMV) induced a pro\u2010tumoral macrophage state, whereas \u03b1\u2010ketoisovalerate (KIV) exerted a pro\u2010inflammatory effect on macrophages. This process was further investigated by a combined metabolomics/proteomics platform. KMV and KIC altered macrophage tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates and increased polyamine metabolism. Proteomic and pathway analyses revealed that the three BCKAs, especially KMV, exhibited divergent effects on the inflammatory signal pathways, phagocytosis, apoptosis and redox balance. These findings uncover cancer\u2010derived BCKAs as novel determinants for macrophage polarization with potential to be selectively exploited for optimizing antitumor immune responses.</p>",

The animals were kept in a pathogen-free environment. Every procedure was carried out under sterile conditions and according to the regulations of the Ethics Committee for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals at the Medical University Vienna.</p><p><br></p><p>For cell culture, all cells were cultured at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified (5% CO2) atmosphere. All cancer cell lines were obtained by ATCC and routinely cultured in Dulbecco\u02b9s Modified Eagle\u02b9s Medium (DMEM) high glucose containing 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 IU/mL penicillin and 100 mg/mL streptomycin (DMEM complete medium). All the cultured cells were tested negative for mycoplasma contamination regularly.</p><p><br></p><p>Bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDM) were obtained as previously described<strong>[1]</strong>. Briefly, femurs and tibiae from wild-type C57BL/6JRI mice (Janvier) aged 6-8 weeks were flushed and bone marrow (BM) cells collected by centrifugation at 400 x g for 5 min at 4 \u00b0C. BM cells were resuspended in BMDM differentiation medium and cultured in non-tissue culture treated petri dishes for 6-7 days. BMDM differentiation medium consists of DMEM high glucose, 10% heatinactivated FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 IU/mL penicillin and 100 mg/mL streptomycin supplemented with 20% L929-conditioned supernatant. The medium was replaced every 3 days. On day 6 or 7, differentiated BMDM (96% of the cells were positive for F4/80 and CD11b) were washed, harvested and seeded in the DMEM complete medium for different experiments. iBMDM was kindly provided by Laszlo Nagy (Debrecen University, Hungary) and cultured in iBMDM medium consisting of DMEM high glucose, 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 10% L929-conditioned supernatant, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 IU/mL penicillin and 100 mg/mL streptomycin.</p><p><br></p><p>For conditioned medium (CM) preparation, 5 x 10^6 cancer cells or BMDM or iBMDM were seeded in 20 mL DMEM complete medium, and conditioned medium (CM) was collected after 24 h and centrifuged at 410 x g. for 4 min. The supernatant was passed through a 0.22-\u03bcm filter to eliminate debris before use.</p><p><br></p><p>For proliferation assay, cancer cells were seeded in 24 well plates (AE17 2 x 10^4 cells per well, A549 4 x 10^4 cells per well), BMDM or iBMDM in 12-well plates (4 x 10^4 cells per well) in DMEM complete media and allowed to grow overnight. Macrophages were then washed with PBS and received fresh medium supplemented with or without indicated concentrations of BCKAs. To maintain constant nutrient levels and remove waste liberated from dead cells, the medium was replaced every 24 h. Live cell numbers were quantitated with the Vi-CELL XR cell counter (BECKMAN). KIV (Cat: HY-W006057) and KMV (Cat: HY-113063) were purchased from MedChemExpress. KIC (Cat: 68255) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All BCKAs are made up in DMEM. The experiment was performed in 3 independent biological replicates.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Wilson JL, N\u00e4gele T, Linke M, Demel F, Fritsch SD, Mayr HK, Cai Z, Katholnig K, Sun X, Fragner L, Miller A, Haschemi A, Popa A, Bergthaler A, Hengstschl\u00e4ger M, Weichhart T, Weckwerth W.

In brief, iBMDM were seeded at 0.85 x 10^6 cells per well of a 6 well plate and allowed to attach for overnight. Cells were washed with PBS and received fresh medium supplemented with 200 \u03bcM KIV, 200 \u03bcM KIC and 200 \u03bcM KMV, respectively. After 2 h and 24 h incubation, cells were washed in cooled 0.9% NaCl and extracted in 1 mL/well of 80% methanol with 0.3 nM Pentaerythritol and 2.5 nM Phenyl \u03b2-D-glucopyranoside as internal extraction standards. Extraction samples were incubated for 15 min at 4 \u00b0C, then centrifuged for 10 min at 21,000 x g. The supernatant was transferred to a fresh polypropylene tube and dried in a SpeedVac (Labogene). The cell pellet was lysed by RIPA and used to measure protein levels for normalization purposes. A total of 15 \u03bcL of methoxyamine hydrochloride solution (40 mg dissolved in 1 mL pyridine) was added to the dried fraction which was then incubated for 90 min at 30 \u00b0C. Next, 60 \u03bcL of (N-Methyl-N-trimethylsilyltrifluoracetamid) MSTFA was added and incubated for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C. Reaction mixtures were centrifuged for 10 min and 4 \u00b0C at 21,000 x g and the supernatants were transferred to glass vials with micro-inserts.</p><p><br></p><p>To measure the KIC, KIV, KMV, leucine, isoleucine, and valine contents on CM samples, 3 aliquots (100 \u03bcL) were run for each CM. Briefly, 400 \u03bcL prechilled methanol containing internal standards was added to 100 \u03bcL media samples and kept for 1 h at 4 \u00b0C. The samples were then centrifuged for 10 min and 4 \u00b0C at 21,000 x g, and the supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes and dried in a SpeedVac. A total of 20 \u03bcL methoxyamine hydrochloride solution (40 mg/1 mL pyridine) and 80 \u03bcL MSTFA were used for metabolite derivatization. Measurement and data process was performed as described above. Different concentrations of standard compounds were extracted and measured under the same conditions to calculate the standard curves for absolute quantification.</p><p><br></p><p>Dried extracts were derivatized batch-wise directly before analyses by GC-MS. Alkane (C10-C40, Sigma-Aldrich) was used for determination of retention indices. A mix of metabolite standards (QC) was also included in different concentration in order to confirm metabolite identifications. As the dynamic range of analytes was too high to quantify all peaks in a run, some samples (Tumor-conditioned media) were injected again with a split rate 1:5. Measurement of metabolites was performed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) standard protocols<strong>[3]</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>LC-MS</strong></p><p>Briefly, iBMDM was seeded at 0.8 x 10^6 cells per well of a 6 well plate and allowed to attach for overnight.
