                "description": "Nucleotides (NTs) are regulatory factors in many biological processes and play important roles in the growth, development, and metabolism of living organisms. We used senescence-accelerated mouse prone-8 (SAMP8) to investigate the effects of NTs on the gut microbiota and metabolites. And the promoting effect of NTs on the growth of a probiotic (Lactobacillus casei) was explored through in vitro experiments. The results showed that the sequencing depth of 16S rDNA covered all microbial species in the feces of SAMP8. Supplementation with exogenous NTs to the diet enhanced the diversity of the gut microbiota, reduced the abundance of bacteria with negative effects on the body (such as Verrucomicrobia, Ruminococcaceae, Akkermansia and Helicobacter), and increased the abundance of the microbiota, which had beneficial effects on the mice (such as Lactobacillus, Candidatus saccharimonas and Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group). Metabonomic analysis showed that NT deficiency in the diet significantly affected metabolites in the mouse feces. The metabolites in mice supplemented with NTs tended to be normal (SAMR1). The differentially expressed metabolites caused by NT addition are involved in various pathways in the body, including linoleic acid metabolism, vitamin B6 metabolism, and histidine metabolism. Correlation analysis revealed a significant correlation between the gut microbiota and differentially expressed metabolites caused by the addition of NTs. In vitro experiments showed that NTs significantly promoted the growth, secretion of biofilm and extracellular polymeric substance of L. casei. NTs also promoted the ability of the crude extract of L. casei to resist the secretion of Shigella biofilm. Thus, NTs can regulate the abundance of the gut microbiota and alter the metabolic expression of the intestinal microbiome.",

(Beijing, China). All <strong>mice </strong>had free access to food (American Institute of Nutrition Rodent Diets-93M (AIN-93M diet) and water. Dietary NTs (5\u2032-NTs: 5\u2032AMP: 5\u2032CMP: 5\u2032GMPNa2: 5\u2032UMPNa2 = 16:41:19:24) were provided by Dalian Zhen-Ao Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Dalian, China). The environment was maintained at 25 \u00b1 1\u00b0C with a relative&nbsp;humidity of 50%\u201360% and 12-h: 12-h light-dark cycle. <strong>Mice </strong>were allowed to adapt to the new environment for 7 d. The <strong>SAMP8 mice</strong> were randomly divided into 3 groups with 50 mice in each group: <strong>NT-free</strong> group (group A), <strong>basal diet</strong> group (group B), and <strong>NT intervention</strong> group (group C) (1200 mg/kg\u00d7bw), and 50 SAMR1 mice served as the model <strong>control </strong>group (Group D). 1 mouse in each cage. The mice in <strong>NT-free </strong>group were fed with the purified formula of AIN93M, and the<strong> basal diet</strong> was used for the <strong>controls </strong>(<strong>SAMP8 and SAMR1</strong>). For the<strong> NTs-treated group</strong>, <strong>NTs </strong>were added to the <strong>basal </strong>diet as an intervention. The ingredients of <strong>purified die</strong>t and <strong>basal diet </strong>can refer to <strong>Table S1</strong> and <strong>Table S2 </strong>in the paper associated with this study as well as the differences of <strong>NTs </strong>content among the groups were shown in the tables. The NTs levels in NT-free, basal and NTs-supplied diets were shown in <strong>Table S3</strong> in the paper associated with this study. <strong>Age</strong>-related changes in the body and behavior of mice were measured by aging degree scores according to the method published<strong>[1]</strong>. In month 10, when <strong>aging </strong>was observed in the mice, their <strong>feces </strong>were collected aseptically. The aseptic cushion was replaced on the day of sampling to reduce contamination of the samples by external microorganisms. The <strong>feces </strong>of 6 mice from each group were randomly sampled and ensured that the feeding environment, NTs intervention and sampling time were as consistent as possible to eliminate the effects cage to cage variations. The samples were transported to Shanghai Baiqu Biomedical Technology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China) with dry ice for 16S rDNA and metabonomic detection.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Hosokawa M, Kasai R, Higuchi K, Takeshita S, Shimizu K, Hamamoto H, Honma A, Irino M, Toda K, Matsumura A, et al.
