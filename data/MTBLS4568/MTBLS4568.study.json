                "description": "<p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> Periodontal ligament mesenchymal stem cells (PDLSCs) are a promising cell resource for cell-based regenerative medicine in dentistry. PDLSCs inevitably acquire a senescent phenotype after prolonged in vitro expansion, and the key regulators of cells during replicative senescence remain unclear.</p><p><strong>METHODS:</strong> We cultured periodontal ligament stem cells to passages 4, 10 and 20 (P4, P10, P20). The senescent phenotypes, proliferation and migration ability of PDLSCs (P4, P10, P20) were detected, and non-targeted metabonomic sequencing was performed. We treated PDLSCs with AICAR and detected the expression of FOXO1, FOXO3a, FOXO6 and AMPK phosphorylation (p-AMPK) levels of replicating senescent PDLSCs to explore the correlation between the metabolic changes and the AMPK pathway.</p><p><strong>RESULTS:</strong> Immunofluorescence staining of \u03b3-H2AX, \u03b2-galactosidase staining, cell scratch test and qPCR were performed to confirm the occurrence of replicative senescence in PDLSCs during passaging. Three groups of cells at passage 4 (P4), passage 10 (P10) and passage 20 (P20) were collected for non-targeted metabolomics analysis. Metabonomic sequencing showed that the metabolism of replicative senescence in PDLSCs varied significantly. In particular, the content of fatty acid metabolites decreased with senescence, including capric acid, stearic acid, myristic acid and dodecanoic acid. KEGG pathway analysis showed that the AMPK signaling pathway was closely related to AMP levels. The AMP:ATP ratio increased in senescent PDLSCs; however, the levels of p-AMPK and the profile of FOXO1 and FOXO3a, which are downstream of the AMPK signaling pathway, decreased with senescence. We treated PDLSCs with AICAR, an activator of the AMPK pathway, and the phosphorylated AMPK level at P20 PDLSCs was partially restored. </p><p><strong>CONCLUSION:</strong> In summary, our study suggests that the metabolic process of PDLSCs is active in the early stage of senescence, prefers to consume fatty acids, and is attenuated in the later stages of senescence. AMP accumulates in replicative senescent PDLSCs; however, the sensitivity of AMPK phosphorylation sites is impaired, causing senescent PDLSCs to fail to respond to changes in energy metabolism. Our findings provide a new basis for the clinical application of periodontal ligament stem cells.</p>",

In both ESI positive and negative modes, the column temperature was 25 \u00b0C, flow rate was 0.5 mL/min, injection volume was 2 \u03bcL, the mobile phase contained A was 25 mM ammonium acetate and 25 mM ammonium hydroxide in water, and B was acetonitrile. The gradient elution procedure was as follows: 0.0-0.5 min, 95% B; 0.5-7.0 min, B changes linearly from 95% to 65%; 7.0-8.0 min, B changes linearly from 65% to 40%; 8.0-9.0 min, B maintained at 40%; 9.0-9.1 min, B changes linearly from 40% to 95%; 9.1-12.0 min, B maintained at 95%. During the whole analysis process, the sample was placed in an automatic sampler at 4 \u00b0C. In order to avoid the influence caused by the fluctuation of the instrument detection signal, a random sequence was used for continuous analysis of samples. QC samples were inserted into the sample queue to monitor and evaluate the stability of the system and the reliability of experimental data.</p>",
