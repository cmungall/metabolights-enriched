                "description": "<p>The capacity of planktonic marine microorganisms to actively seek out and exploit microscale chemical hotspots has been widely theorized to affect ocean-basin scale biogeochemistry, but has never been examined comprehensively in situ among natural microbial communities. Here, using a field-based microfluidic platform to quantify the behavioural responses of marine bacteria and archaea, we observed significant levels of chemotaxis towards microscale hotspots of phytoplankton-derived dissolved organic matter (DOM) at a coastal field site across multiple deployments, spanning several months. Microscale metagenomics revealed that a wide diversity of marine prokaryotes, spanning 27 bacterial and 2 archaeal phyla, displayed chemotaxis towards microscale patches of DOM derived from 10 globally distributed phytoplankton species. The distinct DOM composition of each phytoplankton species attracted phylogenetically and functionally discrete populations of bacteria and archaea, with 54% of chemotactic prokaryotes displaying highly specific responses to the DOM derived from only one or two phytoplankton species. Prokaryotes exhibiting chemotaxis towards phytoplankton-derived compounds were significantly enriched in the capacity to transport and metabolize specific phytoplankton-derived chemicals, and displayed enrichment in functions conducive to symbiotic relationships, including genes involved in the production of siderophores, B vitamins and growth-promoting hormones. Our findings demonstrate that the swimming behaviour of natural prokaryotic assemblages is governed by specific chemical cues, which dictate important biogeochemical transformation processes and the establishment of ecological interactions that structure the base of the marine food web.</p>",

Cultures were grown at their optimal light, temperature and nutrient conditions. The growth dynamic of each <strong>phytoplankton </strong>culture was predetermined by conducting growth curves using flow cytometry. To grow cells, 4 flasks per species containing 250 mL of cultures were monitored twice a day for photophysiology parameters (photosynthetic efficiency (FV/FM) and chlorophyll) using Fast-Repetition Rate Fluorometry (FRRf; FastOcean MKIII) coupled to a FastAct laboratory system (Chelsea Technologies 167 Group). The system was programmed to deliver single turnover saturation of photosystem II from a succession of 100 flashlets (1 \u03bcs pulse with a 2 \u03bcs interval between flashes), followed by a relaxation phase of 40 flashlets (1 \u03bcs pulse with a 50 \u03bcs interval between flashes). A total of 40 sequences were performed per acquisition, with an interval of 150 ms between sequences. Algal cells were harvested when their FV/FM was at its maximal value and chlorophyll was exponentially increasing (mid-exponential phase).</p>",

Samples were centrifuged at low speed (1,500 g for 10 min, room temperature), supernatant was removed, and the algal pellet was snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80 \u00b0C until required. Chemical extractions for metabolomics were carried out as follows: frozen algal pellets were freeze-dried overnight and extracted using 450 \u00b5l of HPLC-grade methanol (containing<strong> internal standards (ITSD</strong>) at a 0.5% final concentration; 13C6-Sorbitol; 13C-15N -Valine, penta-fluorobenzoic acid and 2-aminoanthracene). Samples were mixed briefly and the extract and cell slurry were transferred into a 2 mL Eppendorf tube. The process was repeated with an extra 450 \u00b5l of HPLC-grade methanol (with ITSD), ensuring that no phytoplankton material remained in the freeze-dried tube. The Eppendorf tubes were mixed by vortexing, then sonicated for 10 min on ice to rupture the cells, before being incubated for 30 min in a thermomixer at 1000 rpm (room temperature). Tubes were then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min (room temperature), and supernatant was transferred into new Eppendorf tubes. The remaining cell debris was resuspended in 900 \u00b5l of 50% HPLC-grade methanol (without ITSD), incubated for 30 min in a thermomixer at 1000 rpm and then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min (room temperature). The supernatants were combined, mixed and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C. The final supernatant was transferred into a new tube, dried using a vacuum concentrator (Vacufuge, Eppendorf) and analysed for metabolomics. The same extraction protocol was followed for the samples allocated to ISCA deployments, with the exception that no internal standards were added to the methanol. At the end of the extraction protocol, each extract was aliquoted, dried using a vacuum concentrator and the resulting dry weight was quantified.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Sample derivatisation</strong></p><p>Dried samples for untargeted analysis were prepared by adding 20 \u00b5L of Methoxyamine Hydrochloride (30 mg/mL in Pyridine) followed by shaking at 37 \u00b0C for 2 h.
