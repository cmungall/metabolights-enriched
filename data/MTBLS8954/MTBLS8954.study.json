                "description": "<p><strong>SCOPE:</strong> Cow's milk allergy (CMA) is one of the most prevalent food allergies in early childhood, often treated via elimination diets including standard&nbsp;amino acid-based formula or amino acid-based formula supplemented with synbiotics (AAF or AAF-S). This work aimed to assess the effect of cow's milk (CM) tolerance acquisition and synbiotic (inulin, oligofructose, Bifidobacterium breve M-16&nbsp;V) supplementation on the fecal metabolome in infants with IgE-mediated CMA.</p><p><strong>METHODS AND RESULTS: </strong>The CMA-allergic infants received AAF or AAF-S for a year during which fecal samples were collected. The samples were subjected to metabolomics analyses covering gut microbial metabolites including SCFAs, tryptophan metabolites and bile acids (BAs). Longitudinal data analysis suggested amino acids, BAs and branched SCFAs alterations in infants who outgrew CMA during the intervention. Synbiotic supplementation significantly modified the fecal metabolome after 6 months of intervention, including altered purine, BA and unsaturated fatty acid levels, and increased metabolites of infant-type Bifidobacterium species: indolelactic acid and 4-hydroxyphenyllactic acid.</p><p><strong>CONCLUSION: </strong>This study offers no clear conclusion on the impact of CM-tolerance acquisition on the fecal metabolome. However, our results show that 6 months of synbiotic supplementation successfully altered fecal metabolome and suggest induced bifidobacteria activity, which subsequently declined after 12 months of intervention.</p>",

The synbiotic blend consisted of the FOS: oligofructose and inulin in a 9:1 ratio (total concentration of 0.63 g / 100 mL formula) and Bifidobacterium breve M-16V (1.47 x 10^9 cfu / 100 mL formula). After 12 months of intervention, the allergy status was re-evaluated through double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) with CM. Detailed information on the blend, the dosage, diagnosis and reassessment was previously published<strong>[2]</strong>. Out of the 169 participants enrolled in PRESTO, 40 subjects (aged 3-13 months) were selected for this study based on sample availability. One subject was excluded due to unclear allergy status after 12 months<strong>[1]</strong>. Of the 16 AAF and 23 AAF-S participants, 10 and 14 infants, respectively, outgrew CMA within 12 months. Stool samples were available at 0 (baseline, TP0), 6 (TP1) and 12 months (TP2) after the start of the intervention, resulting in a total of 117 samples.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Sample collection and storage</strong></p><p>The sample collection procedure has been described previously<strong>[1]</strong>. In short, fecal samples were collected at home and immediately stored in freezers, then transferred on ice to the participant hospitals (within 3 months) and stored at -80 \u00b0C until transfer to Danone Research &amp; Innovation (Utrecht, the Netherlands) for wet sample aliquoting and SCFAs and lactic acid analysis. Sample aliquots for LC-MS metabolomics analysis were transferred on dry-ice to Leiden University and stored at -80 \u00b0C until analysis.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>LC-MS metabolomics analysis</strong></p><p>Polar to semi-polar metabolites, including acetylcarnitines, amines, benzenoids, organic acids, indoles, nucleosides and nucleotides, were analyzed using reverse phase LC coupled with quadrupole (Q)-TOF-MS operated in full-scan positive and negative ionization modes, as described previously<strong>[3]</strong> and in the supplementary material in the paper associated with this study. Bile and fatty acids were measured using reverse phase LC separation using Q-TOF-MS operated in full scan negative ionization mode, as described in the supplementary material.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Chemicals</strong></p><p>Methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE, \u226599.8%) and ammonium formate (\u226599.0%) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, United States). LC-MS-grade methanol (MeOH), isopropanol and formic acid (FA) were purchased from Biosolve B.V. (Valkenswaard, Netherlands). LC-MS grade acetonitrile was purchased from Actu-all chemicals (Randmeer, The Netherlands) and Biosolve B.V. (Valkenswaard, Netherlacnjugnds).

After a 3-min vortex mixing (Marshall Scientific, Cambridge, UK) 120 \u00b5L ice-cold MTBE was added, followed by another 3-min vortex mixing. Following a brief centrifugation (30 s, 100 x g, 4 \u00b0C), 200 \u00b5L of water and 168 \u00b5L of MTBE were added.

All solvents used during the LLE were ice-cold and vortex mixing was always at maximum speed. Following layer separation, each layer was transferred to an Eppendorf tube, followed by 5.0 and 2.5 min of centrifugation (16,000 x g, 4 \u00b0C) for aqueous and organic layers respectively. After extraction, 150 \u00b5L of the aqueous layer was aliquoted for polar to semi-polar metabolites analysis, while 48.8 \u03bcL of aqueous and 28.8 \u03bcL of organic layer was combined for the bile and fatty acids analysis. The aliquots were dried in a Speedvac (Labcono, USA) and stored at -80 \u00b0C. Prior to LC-MS analysis, the extracts were reconstituted in 50 \u00b5L of 0.1% FA in water for polar to semi-polar metabolites analysis and 200 \u00b5L of MeOH for the bile and fatty acids analysis.

For the preparation of the quality control sample, 30 study samples were weighed and extracted.

Data acquisition was carried out on SCIEX OS 2.1.6.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>LC-MS analysis of polar to semi polar metabolites (Assay 2 &amp; 3):</strong></p><p>Analysis of polar to semi-polar metabolites were performed with a Shimadzu Nexera X2 LC system coupled to a TripleTOF 6600 mass spectrometer (SCIEX, Foster City, CA, USA), as described previously. Briefly, the LC separation was carried out at 40 \u00b0C using a Waters Acquity UPLC HSS T3 column (1.8 \u03bcm, 2.1 mm x 100 mm) with pre-column in-line stainless steel filter (0.3 \u03bcm, Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany). The mobile phase A was 0.1% FA in water, and the mobile phase B was 0.1% FA in ACN (Actu-all chemicals). With a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min and 1 \u03bcL of injection volume, the gradient starts at 100% A; 0.0-0.5 min 80% A; 0.5-2.5 min 2% A; 2.5-7.5 min 2% A; 7.5-12.0 min 2% A; 12.0-15.0 100% A. The autosampler temperature was set at 10 \u00b0C. To decelerate the contamination of the MS, the LC flow was diverted to waste at 7 min of the gradient by an external valve (Valco instruments, USA). During the analysis, the PCI compounds were continuously pumped by a binary Agilent 1260 Infinity pump (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, USA) at a flow rate of 20 \u00b5L/min&nbsp;and combined to the LC flow with a T-piece (IDEX, PEEK Tee, 0.02 Thru hole, F-300) before entering the ESI source.</p>",
