        "description": "Examination of changes in urinary metabolomic profiles after vegetable ingestion may lead to new methods of assessing plant food intake. To this regard, we developed a proof-of-principle methodology to identify urinary metabolomic signatures for spinach, celery, and onion. Three feeding studies were conducted to determine, validate, and test the identified signatures. Two separated sets of healthy individuals participated in the first two studies were fed with spinach, celery, onion, and no vegetable in four separated experiments. The second set of individuals also participated in the third study where all three vegetables were fed simultaneously. An LC/MS-based metabolomics approach was adopted to search for indicative metabolites from urine samples collected at multiple time periods before and after the meal. Consequently, a total of 1, 9, and 3 non-overlapping urinary metabolites were associated with the intake of spinach, celery, and onion, respectively. The PCA signature of these metabolites followed a similar \u201ctime cycle\u201d pattern, which maximized at approximately 2\u20134 h after intake. In addition, the metabolite profiles for the same vegetable were consistent across samples, regardless consumed individually or in combination. The developed methodology along with the identified urinary metabolomic signatures were potential tools for assessing plant food intake.",

Briefly, peaks were grouped and annotated in a quantitation result that related to the same metabolites. Subsequently, each peak group was assigned an identity based on precursor and fragment matches in metabolomic databases. For peak groups with limited fragments, MS/MS spectra were generated to confirm their underlying metabolites.\n</br<</br>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Lynn KS, Cheng ML, Chen YR, Hsu C, Chen A, Lih TM, Chang HY, Huang CJ, Shiao MS, Pan WH, Sung TY, Hsu WL.
