                "description": "<p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a major public health problem due to the high incidence affecting approximately one-third of the world\u2019s population. NAFLD is usually linked to obesity and excessive weight. A subset of patients with NAFLD express normal or low body mass index; thus, the condition is called nonobese NAFLD or lean NAFLD. However, patients and healthcare professionals have little awareness and understanding of NAFLD in nonobese individuals. Furthermore, preclinical results from nonobese animal models with NAFLD are unclear. Gut microbiota and their metabolites in nonobese/lean NAFLD patients differ from those in obese NAFLD patients. Therefore, we analyzed the biochemical indices, intestinal flora and intestinal metabolites in a nonobese NAFLD mouse model established using a methionine-choline deficient (MCD) diet. The significantly lean MCD mice had a remarkable fatty liver with lower serum triglyceride and free fatty acid levels as well as higher alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase levels than normal mice. 16s RNA sequencing of fecal DNA showed that the overall richness and diversity of the intestinal flora decreased in MCD mice, whereas the Firmicutes/Bacteroidota ratio was increased. <em>g_Tuzzerella, s_Bifidobacterium pseudolongum</em> and <em>s_Faecalibaculum rodentium</em> were the predominant species in nonobese NAFLD mice. Fecal metabolomics using LC-MS/MS revealed the potential biomarkers for the prognosis and diagnosis of nonobese NAFLD, including high levels of tyramine glucuronide, 9,12,13-TriHOME and pantetheine 4'-phosphate, and low levels of 3-carbamoyl-2-phenylpropionaldehyde, N-succinyl-L,L-2,6-diaminopimelate, 4-methyl-5-thiazoleethanol, homogentisic acid and estriol. Our findings could be useful to identify and develop drugs to treat nonobese NAFLD and lean NAFLD.</p>",

Briefly, 7 week-old specific-pathogen-free C57BL/6J (Guangzhou, SCXK [Yue] 2022-0002) male mice were purchased from the Guangdong Medical Laboratory Animal Center (Foshan, China). The mice were subjected to a 12/12 h light/dark cycle and a constant temperature (22 \u00b1 2 \u00b0C) and provided free access to a standard chow diet and water. After 7 days of adaptive feeding, the mice were randomly divided into a normal control (NC) group fed a standard diet (CAS: 1010009, Jiangsu Xietong Pharmaceutical Bio-engineering Co., Ltd) (n = 6) and NAFLD mice fed the MCD diet (CAS: MCD, Shanghai Yitong Biotechnology Co., Ltd) (n = 6) for 60 days. The body weights of mice were recorded during feeding every 3 days. The stools of mice were collected before sacrifice. All mice were fasted overnight at the end of the prescribed feeding period. The whole blood was collected from the retro-orbital plexus, allowed to stand at room temperature for at least 30 min, and then centrifuged (2500 rpm for 20 min) to obtain the serum. A small portion of the freshly isolated and weighed livers was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and the remaining liver samples and sera were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 \u00b0C until further analysis.</p>",

Samples were ground using a Wonbio-96c frozen tissue grinder (Shanghai Wanbo Biotechnology Co., LTD) for 6 min (-10 \u00b0C, 50 Hz), followed by low-temperature ultrasonic extraction for 30 min (5 \u00b0C, 40 kHz). The samples were left at -20 \u00b0C for 30 min and centrifuged for 15 min (4 \u00b0C, 13,000 x g), and the supernatant was transferred to an injection vial for LC-MS/MS. A pooled quality control (QC) sample was prepared by mixing equal volumes of all samples and injected at regular intervals (every 5-15 samples) for system conditioning and QC.</p>",
