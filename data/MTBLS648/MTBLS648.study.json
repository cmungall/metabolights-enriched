                "description": "We report the effect of four lifespan modifying drugs and of combinations of these drugs on lipid profile in Caenorhabditis elegans. We investigated drug-drug interactions and identified beneficial drug interactions between drugs selected to target synergistic longevity mechanisms and pathways. We employ ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS) to compare the abundance of lipid species in treated and control animals. Adult nematodes were treated with rapamycin, rifampicin, psora-4 and allantoin and combinations of these compounds and the resulting change in lipid profiles, specifically in those of triacylglycerol (TAG), phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) were determined. We quantified changes resulting from treatment with the drug combinations relative to untreated controls and relative to animals treated with each constituent single drugs. We further determined the dependence of changes in lipid profiles on genes know to affect lipid metabolism using strains carrying mutations in these pathways. In particular, we determined lipid profiles in genetic model of caloric restriction (eat-2), strain lacking homolog of TGF\u03b2 (daf-7) and in strain lacking the SREBP/sbp-1 transcription factor.",

Briefly, 800 \u00b5l of ice-cold chloroform-methanol (1:2 v/v) was added to the homogenates and vigorously vortexed for 1 min followed by shaking at 1200 RPM for 30 min using a thermomixer (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). In order to minimize oxidation during extraction, 0.5% butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) was added to the organic solvents. For method validation and to control lipid-class dependent differences in extraction and ionization, at the time of extraction samples were spiked with known amounts of internal standards (Avanti polar lipids, Alabaster, AL, USA) corresponding to each lipid class. Upon centrifugation, the organic phase was transferred to a fresh centrifuge tube and dried under vacuum using a vacuum concentrator (SpeedVac, Thermo Savant, Milford, USA). The dried lipid extract was reconstituted in 100 ml methanol and stored until the MS analysis was performed.",

Chromatographic separation was achieved on the LC system equipped with a ZORBAX Eclipse Plus C18 column. Separation of the molecular species was done using a gradient elution. Solvent A was acetonitrile/H2O (60:40 v/v) with 10 mM ammonium formate, while solvent B was isopropanol/acetonitrile (90:10) containing 10mM ammonium formate. The flow rate was set to 0.4 ml/min and the column temperature was 45 \u00b0C. Solvent B was set at 40% at injection and increased linearly to 100% in 7 min, retained at this value for 2 min, decreased back to 40% in 1 min and then retained there until the end of the gradient by 14 min. The eluent was directed to the ESI source of the mass spectrometer operated in the positive ion mode. Lipids were ionized by ESI and each individual lipid molecular species was analyzed using a targeted dynamic multiple reaction monitoring (dMRM) approach measuring over several unique transitions with known precursor/product mass-to-charge ratio (m1/m3) and retention times. The MS conditions were as follows. For ESI: gas temperature, 300 \u00b0C, gas flow, 10 l/min; sheath gas temperature, 350 \u00b0C, sheath gas flow, 8 l/min, and capillary voltage, 3500 V. The resolution of the instrument is about 1,000 at m/z 760 and a mass accuracy of >200ppm. The minimum dwell time used was 19 ms while the run time was 14 min. MRM method was used where Q1 and Q3 were set to pass molecularly distinctive precursor and product ions, whereby collisions were induces in Q2 using N2.",
