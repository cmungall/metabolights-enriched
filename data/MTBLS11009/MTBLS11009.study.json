                "description": "<p>Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is frequently the outcome of oral submucous fibrosis (OSMF), a common possibly premalignant disease. In our study, a cohort of 50 patients with OSCC and OSMF, along with 50 healthy controls, was analyzed to identify significant metabolic differences between the patient and control groups through multivariate statistical analysis using NMR-based metabolomics in saliva samples. The 2D scatter plot of PC1 versus PC2 scores clearly shows a distinction between the groups, with the principal component analysis (PCA) explaining 24.6% of the variance. Partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) demonstrated R2 and Q2 values of 0.94 and 0.90, respectively, indicating a robust model fit. A total of 20 distinct metabolites were identified, including 5 that were up-regulated and 5 down-regulated. Univariate ROC curve analysis identified 9 salivary metabolites with AUC values exceeding 0.70, including acetone, tryptophan, 5-aminopentanoic acid, betaine, aspartic acid, ethanol, acetoacetate, adipic acid and citrate. Notably, the distinct presence of three metabolites - acetone, tryptophan and 5-aminopentanoic acid - yielded AUC values of 0.98123, 0.95358 and 0.91506, respectively. The refined statistical model was subjected to metabolic pathway analysis, revealing interconnected pathways. We could also predict the disease's severity, specifically distinguishing between Stage I and Stage II OSCC. This differentiation was highlighted by the PCA score plot, which explained 28.6% of the variance. PLS-DA further confirmed these results. These insights pave the way for early diagnosis and predicting severity in oral cancer patients, enabling better management of the disease.</p>",

Before collection, participants were advised to abstain from all activities for at least 1 h, including eating, drinking, smoking, and brushing their teeth to avoid contamination and ensure the collection of unstimulated saliva. For each subject, 5 mL of full bland saliva was obtained. using the drooling method, where participants were instructed to allow their saliva to accumulate on the mouth's floor before being drooled into a sterile, chilled saliva container. Immediately after collection, saliva samples were transferred into sterile centrifuge tubes. The samples were centrifuged for 6 min at 4 \u00b0C at 3000 rpm to remove cells and debris. After being cautiously decanted into 2 mL aliquots, the supernatant was kept at -80 \u00b0C.</p>",
