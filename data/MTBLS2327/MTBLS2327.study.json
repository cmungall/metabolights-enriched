                "description": "Apple (Malus \u00d7 domestica) has commercial and nutritional value, but breeding constraints of tree crops limit varietal improvement. Marker-assisted selection minimizes these drawbacks, but breeders lack applications for targeting fruit phytochemicals. To understand genotype-phytochemical associations in apples, we have developed a high-throughput integration strategy for genomic and multi-platform metabolomics data. 124 apple genotypes, including members of three pedigree-connected breeding families alongside diverse cultivars and wild selections, were genotyped and phenotyped. Metabolite genome-wide association studies (mGWAS) were conducted with ~10,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms and phenotypic data acquired via LC-MS and <sup>1</sup> H NMR untargeted metabolomics. Putative metabolite quantitative trait loci (mQTL) were then validated via pedigree-based analyses (PBA). Using our developed method, 519, 726, and 177 putative mQTL were detected in LC-MS positive and negative ionization modes and NMR, respectively. mQTL were indicated on each chromosome, with hotspots on linkage groups 16 and 17. A chlorogenic acid mQTL was discovered on chromosome 17 via mGWAS and validated with a two-step PBA, enabling discovery of novel candidate gene-metabolite relationships. Complementary data from three metabolomics approaches and dual genomics analyses increased confidence in validity of compound annotation and mQTL detection. Our platform demonstrates the utility of multi-omic integration to advance data-driven, phytochemical-based plant breeding.",

Sample extraction order was randomized by random selection of sample bags from freezer storage totes. Several representative slices were removed from each sample freezer bag containing 8 slices. For each apple sample, peel was weighed to 1.0 g \u00b1 0.05 g. Pieces of apple flesh were cut from the slices and added to the peel to reach a combined weight of 5.0 g \u00b1 0.05 g. Apples with inadequate sample collection (n = 5) were weighed to half the value of the standard: peel 0.5 g \u00b1 0.05 g and flesh 2.5 g \u00b1 0.05 g. Separate weighing of peel and flesh was used to account for the different sizes of the apples. Small apples would have a higher peel:flesh ratio than larger apples. This would be problematic in extraction because there is a higher concentration of phytochemicals in the apple peel compared to flesh. Weight matching peel and flesh separately allowed us to see differences in chemical abundance based on true differences instead of differences imparted by fruit size.</p><p><br></p><p>Weight-matched peel and flesh were then placed together in a 50 ml tube with 2x 3/8' x 7/8' angled ceramic cutting stones (W.W. Grainger: Lake Forest, IL; Item no.: 5UJX2). Using a bottle top dispenser (Q-sep Bottle Top Solvent Dispenser, 2.5-30 ml, Restek Corp., Bellefonte, PA, USA), 15 ml of methanol was immediately added to extract polar/semi-polar metabolites and inhibit enzymatic and non-enzymatic oxidation reactions.</p><p><br></p><p>After overnight storage at -80 \u00b0C, tubes were placed in a sample homogenizer (SPEX SamplePrep Geno/Grinder, NJ, USA) for grinding. Samples were then centrifuged at 2,800 x g for 3 min to pellet insoluble material. Supernatant was then syringe-filtered (0.22 \u03bcm PTFE) to remove remaining particulates. Filtered extract was then dispensed for UHPLC-QTOF-MS and NMR analyses. Samples for LC-MS analysis were diluted to 50:50 water:methanol. NMR samples were dried via a vortex vacuum evaporator (Combidancer, Hettich AG, Baech Switzerland).</p><p><br></p><p>A 1.0 ml aliquot of each sample extract was pooled to create a bulk quality control (QC) to be used in the MS experiments. The pooled QC solution was diluted with H2O to 50% MeOH then aliquoted. Several process blanks were made by conducting the extraction method with all the same physical elements except the apple fruit. Analyzing the process blank allowed detection of the presence of any residues or contamination with compounds from the pipette tips, tubes, or pellets used in the extractions. All extracts were stored at -20 \u00b0C until analysis.</p>",

If fragmentation data had been obtained in the untargeted data-dependent MS/MS experiments, MS/MS spectral data were also compared against experimental or predicted MS/MS spectra in databases as well as fragmentation data or spectra in the literature.</p><p><br></p><p>Generation of putative identities was broadly applied to all collected iterative MS/MS spectra using the classical molecular networking platform in the GNPS infrastructure<strong>[2]</strong>. A molecular network was created using the online workflow (<a href='https://ccms-ucsd.github.io/GNPSDocumentation/' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>https://ccms-ucsd.github.io/GNPSDocumentation/</a>) on the GNPS website (<a href='http://gnps.ucsd.edu' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>http://gnps.ucsd.edu</a>). The precursor ion mass tolerance was set to .01 Da and a MS/MS fragment ion tolerance of 0.01 Da. A network was then created where edges were filtered to have a cosine score above 0.65 and more than 6 matched peaks. Further, edges between two nodes were kept in the network if and only if each of the nodes appeared in each other's respective top 10 most similar nodes. Finally, the maximum size of a molecular family was set to 100, and the lowest scoring edges were removed from molecular families until the molecular family size was below this threshold. The spectra in the network were then searched against GNPS spectral libraries. All matches kept between network spectra and library spectra were required to have a score above 0.7 and at least 6 matched peaks. This workflow was repeated as 4 separate jobs, 1 per ionization mode, collision energy combination: negative 20 eV, negative 40 eV, positive 20 eV, and positive 40 eV.</p><p><br></p><p>Chlorogenic acid stock solution was prepared in 1:1 MeOH:H2O. Stock solutions were analyzed with full scan LC-MS and MS/MS with collision energies of 20 and 40 eV. Fragments of note were 191.0574 m/z and 161.0247 m/z, which corresponded to the constituent molecules of <strong>chlorogenic acid</strong>, <strong>3-O-caffeoylquinic acid</strong>, <strong>quinic acid</strong> ([M-H]- 191.0562 m/z) and <strong>caffeic acid</strong> ([M-H2O-H]- 161.0239 m/z), respectively.</p><p><br></p><p>Identities of NMR peaks from the complex mixture were investigated primarily through comparison with identities determined in the literature for polar apple extracts as well as other fruits. Chemical shift and multiplicity were also compared to online databases containing 1D 1H NMR spectral data for pure compounds, namely HMDB<strong>[1]</strong>. For compound ID verification in NMR for chlorogenic acid, spike experiments with the authentic standard were analyzed with additional 1D and 2D 1H NMR analysis. Here, the analytical standard was added to a pooled QC sample and analyzed to determine if the intensity increases for the peaks of interest at specific ppm.</p><p><br></p><p>Chlorogenic acid stock solution was prepared in 80:20 deuterated methanol to 0.2 mM aqueous phosphate buffer solution.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Wishart DS, Feunang YD, Marcu A, Guo AC, Liang K, V\u00e1zquez-Fresno R, Sajed T et al.
