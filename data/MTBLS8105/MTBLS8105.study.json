                "description": "<p>Rapid metabolic responses to pathogens are essential for plant survival and depend on numerous transcription factors. Mediator is the major transcriptional co-regulator for integration and transmission of signals from transcriptional regulators to RNA polymerase II. Using four Arabidopsis Mediator mutants, med16, med18, med25 and cdk8, we studied how differences in regulation of their transcript and metabolite levels correlate to their responses to Pseudomonas syringae infection. We found that med16 and cdk8 were susceptible, while med25 showed increased resistance. Glucosinolates, phytoalexins and carbohydrates were reduced already before infection in med16 and cdk8, but increased in med25, which also display increased benzenoids levels. Early after infection, wild type plants showed reduced glucosinolate and nucleoside levels, but increases in amino acids, benzeniods, oxylipins and the phytoalexin Camalexin. The Mediator mutants showed altered levels of these metabolites and in regulation of genes encoding key enzymes for their metabolism. At later stage, mutants displayed defective levels of specific amino acids, carbohydrates, lipids and jasmonates which correlates to their infection response phenotypes. Our results reveal that MED16, MED25 and CDK8 are required for a proper, coordinated transcriptional response of genes which encode enzymes involved in important metabolic pathways for Arabidopsis responses to Pseudomonas syringae infection.</p>",

Briefly, 20 mg of liquid nitrogen grinded samples were mixed with 1 mL extraction buffer (20/20/60, v/v/v, chloroform:water:methanol) including internal standards for both GC-MS and LC-MS. The LC-MS internal standards were: 13C9-phenylalanine, 13C3-caffeine, D4-cholic acid, D8-arachidonic acid and 13C9-caffeic acid obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA). The GC-MS internal standards were: L-proline-13C5, alpha-ketoglutarate-13C4, myristic acid-13C3, cholesterol-D7 from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc. (CIL; Andover, MA, USA) and succinic acid-D4, salicylic acid-D6, L-glutamic acid-13C5,15N, putrescine-D4, hexadecenoic acid-13C4, D-glucose-13C6, D-sucrose-13C12 from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA). The samples were bead-beated and centrifuged as described<strong>[2]</strong>. Most of the supernatants, 200 \u00b5L for LC-MS analysis and 50 \u00b5L for GC-MS analysis, were transferred to micro vials, evaporated to dryness in a SpeedVac concentrator and stored at -80 \u00b0C until analysis. Small aliquots of the remaining supernatants were pooled and used as quality control (QC) samples. MSMS analysis (LC-MS) was run on the QC samples for identification purposes.

The gas flow rate through the column was 1 mL/min.

Each batch of samples were initially analyzed in positive mode, followed by a switch to negative mode for a second injection of each sample after analyzing all samples within the batch. The chromatographic separation was performed on an Agilent 1290 Infinity UHPLC-system (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany). Briefly, 2 \u03bcL of each sample were injected onto an Acquity UPLC HSS T3, 2.1 x 50 mm, 1.8 \u03bcm C18 column in combination with a 2.1 mm x 5 mm, 1.8 \u03bcm VanGuard precolumn (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA) held at 40 \u00b0C. The gradient elution buffers were A (0.1% formic acid) and B (75/25 (v/v) acetonitrile:2-propanol, 0.1% formic acid), and the flow rate was 0.5 mL/min. The compounds were eluted with a linear gradient consisting of 0.1-10% B over 2 min. B was then increased to 99% over 5 min and held at 99% for 2 min. B was then decreased to 0.1% over 0.3 min and the flow rate was increased to 0.8 mL/min for 30 s. These conditions were kept for 0.9 min, after which the flow rate was reduced to 0.5 mL/min for 0.1 min before the next injection.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Gullberg J, Jonsson P, Nordstr\u00f6m A, Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m M, Moritz T.

The extracted mass spectra were identified by comparisons of their retention index and mass spectra with libraries of retention time indices and mass spectra<strong>[1]</strong>. Mass spectra and retention index comparison was performed using the NIST MS 2.2 software. Annotations of mass spectra were based on reverse and forward searches in the library. Masses and ratios between masses indicative of a derivatized metabolite were especially notified. The mass spectrum with the highest probability indicative of a metabolite and the retention index between the sample and library for the suggested metabolite was \u00b1 5 (usually less than 3) and the deconvoluted 'peak' was annotated as an identification of a metabolite.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>LC-MS profiling</strong></p><p>For the LC-MS data, all data processing was performed using the Agilent MassHunter Profinder version B.10.00 (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA).&nbsp;The processing was performed both in a targeted and an untargeted fashion. For target processing, a pre-defined list of metabolites was analyzed using the Batch Targeted feature extraction in MassHunter Profinder. An in-house LC-MS library built up by authentic standards run on the same system with the same chromatographic and mass-spec settings, was used for the targeted processing<strong>[1]</strong>. The identification of the metabolites was based on MS, MSMS and retention time information.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Davoine C, Abreu IN, Khajeh K, Blomberg J, Kidd BN, Kazan K, Schenk PM, Gerber L, Nilsson O, Moritz T, Bj\u00f6rklund S.
