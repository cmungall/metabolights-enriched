                "description": "<p>While the risk factors for Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) are known, early predictive markers of transition from normal to a prediabetes state are unidentified. We studied the basal metabolism and metabolic response to a mixed-meal challenge in 110 healthy subjects in the age group of 18 to 40 years (Male:Female\u2009=\u20091:1); grouped into first degree relatives of patients with T2DM (n\u2009=\u200930), those with a body mass index &gt;23\u2009kg/m2 but &lt;30\u2009kg/m2 (n\u2009=\u200930), those with prediabetes (n\u2009=\u200920) and normal controls (n\u2009=\u200930). We performed an untargeted metabolomics analysis of plasma and related that with clinical and biochemical parameters, markers of inflammation, and insulin sensitivity. Similar to prediabetes subjects, overweight subjects had insulin resistance and significantly elevated levels of C-peptide, adiponectin and glucagon and lower level of ghrelin. Metabolites such as MG(22:2(13Z, 16Z)/0:0/0:0) and LysoPC (15:0) were reduced in overweight and prediabetes subjects. Insulin sensitivity was significantly lower in men. Fasting levels of uric acid, xanthine, and glycochenodeoxycholic-3-glucuronide were elevated in men. However, both lysophospholipids and antioxidant defense metabolites were higher in women. Impaired postprandial metabolism and insulin sensitivity in overweight normoglycemic young adults indicates a risk of developing hyperglycemia. Our results also indicate a higher risk of diabetes in young men.</p>",

Progenesis QI (Non-linear dynamics, Waters) was employed for peak/feature picking and raw data deconvolution. Progenesis QI performs noise filtering, peak detection, isotope peak removal, alignment of retention time and mass, as well as optional peak/feature normalization. Progenesis produces a feature matrix that contains accurate mass (m/z), retention time (RT), and chromatographic peak area.  MetaX software was used for further processing of normalized data(Wen et al. 2017). The features detected in less than 50% in QC samples or less than 20% in experimental samples were removed. The missing values retained after the initial filtration were imputed with k-nearest neighbor method. A signal correction was performed with the QC-RLSC method to correct batch influence (Dunn et al. 2011). After normalization, features with a relative standard deviation of < 30% in the QC samples were used for further statistical analysis.\nRef:\nDunn WB, Broadhurst D, Begley P, Zelena E, Francis-Mcintyre S, Anderson N, Brown M, Knowles JD, Halsall A, Haselden JN, Nicholls AW, Wilson ID, Kell DB & Goodacre R (2011) Procedures for large-scale metabolic profiling of serum and plasma using gas chromatography and liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry.

Ion source and desolvation gas (nitrogen) temperatures were kept at 1120C and 3500C respectively. The sampling cone and desolvation gas flow rates were 60 L/h and 875 L/h respectively. Capillary voltage was set at 2.85 KV. Sampling cone voltage was set at 40V. The lock mass acquisition was made every 10 seconds by Leucine enkephalin (MW= 555.62) for accurate on-line mass calibration. Initial 10 QC samples run was used for the stabilization of the system (~4 hours). QC samples were analyzed after every 5th sample run. An analytical batch contains an equal number of samples from all study groups and run order was randomized within a batch. One analytical batch had 90 runs and data was acquired up to 35 hours without affecting the stability of the system",

Reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) technique was employed with a C18 (ACQUITY UPLC HSS T3 C18 column, 100 A0, 1.8 \u03bcm, 2.1mm X 100mm, Waters) column. In the RPLC Method, mobile phase consists of aqueous (A) and organic (B) solvent components, where A is 0.1% formic acid in water and B is 0.1% formic acid in methanol. The gradient is 0 min, 0% B; 1 min, 0% B; 16 min, 100% B; 20 min, 100% B, and 22 min, 0% B. The curve parameter of 5 was used for the throughout the gradient except 1 was used for 20 to 22 minutes. The same gradient was used for positive and negative ion mode methods. For the wash cycle, weak wash solvent (100%) water and strong wash solvent (100%) methanol were used in RPLC method. Similarly, the hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) method was performed using a BEH (ACQUITY BEH HILIC column, 130 A0, 1.7 \u03bcm, 2.1mm X 150mm, Waters) column. For the HILIC, A is 95% Acetonitrile in 10mM ammonium acetate and B is 50% Acetonitrile in 10mM ammonium acetate. Both A and B contains 0.1% formic acid or 0.1% acetic acid in positive ion mode and negative ion mode respectively. The HILIC positive ion gradient was 0 min, 1% B; 5 min, 20 %B; 10 min, 50% B; 14 min, 95 %B; 16 min, 95 % B; 17 min, 1 %B; and 20 min, 1 %B. The curve parameter of 6 was used for the throughout the gradient. The HILIC negative ion gradient was 0 min, 1% B; 3 min, 20 %B; 6 min, 50% B; 9 min, 95 %B; 10 min, 95 % B; 11 min, 1 %B; and 15 min, 1 %B. The curve parameter of 6 was used for the throughout the gradient. For HILIC wash cycle, weak wash solvent (100%) acetonitrile and strong solvent (100%) were used. The injection volume was 5 \u00b5l with a flow rate of 0.4ml/min and the column temperature of\u3016 40\u3017^0 C.",
