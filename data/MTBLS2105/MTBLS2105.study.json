                "description": "<p>While bacterial metabolism is known to impact antibiotic efficacy and virulence, the metabolic capacities of individual microbes in cystic fibrosis lung infections are difficult to disentangle from sputum samples. Here, we show that untargeted metabolomic profiling of supernatants of multiple strains of<em> Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> and <em>Staphylococcus aureus </em>grown in monoculture in synthetic cystic fibrosis media (SCFM) reveal distinct species-specific metabolic signatures with limited strain-to-strain variability. The majority of metabolites significantly consumed by <em>S. aureus </em>were also consumed by <em>P. aeruginosa</em>, indicating that <em>P. aeruginosa</em> has the flexibility to metabolically outcompete<em> S. aureus </em>in coculture even in the absence of other pathogen-pathogen interactions. Finally, metabolites that were uniquely produced by one species or the other were identified. Specifically, the virulence factor precursor anthranilic acid as well as the quinoline 2,4-Quinolinediol (DHQ) were robustly produced across all tested strains of <em>P. aeruginosa</em>. Through the direct comparison of the extracellular metabolism of <em>P. aeruginosa</em> and <em>S. aureus</em> in a physiologically relevant environment, this work provides insight towards the potential metabolic interactions in vivo and supports the development of species-specific diagnostic markers of infection.</p>",

                        "description": "<p><strong>Bacterial strains and media conditions</strong></p><p>3 lab strains, 1 laboratory adapted lab strain, and 5 clinical isolates were selected for metabolomics profiling (see <strong>Table 1 </strong>in the paper associated with this study). <strong><em>P. aeruginosa</em></strong> strain <strong>UCBPP-PA14[1]</strong>, <strong>methicillin-sensitive <em>S. aureus</em></strong> strain <strong>ATCC 29213</strong>, and <strong>methicillin-resistant <em>S. aureus</em></strong> strain <strong>LAC (USA300)</strong> were selected as representative laboratory strains.<strong> <em>P. aeruginosa</em></strong><em> </em>strain <strong>UCBPP-PA14 </strong>was additionally adapted to <strong>SCFM </strong>for 10 d as described below. Clinical isolates were provided by the CDC and FDA Antibiotic Resistance Isolate Bank<strong>[2][3]</strong>. Specifically, 3 clinical isolates from the \u2018<strong><em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em></strong>\u2019 panel (<strong>ID 234</strong>, <strong>ID 249</strong>, and <strong>ID 258</strong>) and 2 clinical isolates from the \u2018<strong><em>Staphylococcus </em></strong>with <strong>Borderline Oxacillin Susceptibility</strong>\u2019 panel (<strong>ID 474 </strong>and <strong>ID 484</strong>) were selected due to their differing levels of antibiotic susceptibility.</p><p><br></p><p>For supernatant collection, cultures were revived from frozen on <strong>lysogeny broth</strong> <strong>(LB) </strong>agar plates, inoculated into <strong>LB liquid media</strong>, and washed in 1 x <strong>DPBS </strong>prior to inoculation into <strong>SCFM</strong>. <strong>SCFM </strong>was prepared and stored at 4 \u00b0C as previously described<strong>[4]</strong>. Stocks of <strong>SCFM </strong>components were remade as they were depleted or if precipitation or a change in color was observed. <strong>SCFM </strong>was selected over <strong>SCFM2[5]</strong> to maximize the number of media components that could be detected in our metabolomics analysis as well as to avoid challenges associated with viscous samples<strong>[6]</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Generation of an SCFM-evolved P. aeruginosa strain </strong></p><p><strong><em>P. aeruginosa</em> </strong>strain <strong>UCBPP-PA14</strong> <strong>(isogenic) </strong>was evolved to <strong>SCFM </strong>for 10 d prior to metabolomics profiling to create a <strong>SCFM-evolved <em>P. aeruginosa</em> </strong>isolate. Briefly, <strong>isogenic <em>P. aeruginosa</em></strong> was streaked onto an <strong>LB agar</strong> plate and incubated for 24 h at 37 \u00b0C. A single colony was inoculated into 5 mL of <strong>SCFM </strong>and 200 \u03bcL of this culture was moved to a single well in a 96 well plate. Throughout the adaptive evolution experiment, the SCFM-evolved lineage was incubated at 37 \u00b0C with shaking and the OD600 of the lineage was measured every 10 min (Tecan Infinite M200 Pro, see <strong>Figure S2A </strong>in the paper associated with this study). Every 24 h, 5 \u03bcL of culture was propagated into 195 \u03bcL of fresh <strong>SCFM</strong>, resulting in a 1:40 dilution. The remaining sample was frozen at a final concentration of 25% glycerol. This process was repeated for 10 d when growth rates had levelled out for 5 d (see <strong>Figure S2B</strong> in the paper associated with this study) with the exception of between Day 5 and Day 6 where the lineage was revived from frozen to inspect and confirm homogeneity.</p><p><br></p><p>As a final check to ensure homogeneity, the d 10 <strong>SCFM-evolved <em>P. aeruginosa</em></strong><em> </em>was streaked onto an <strong>LB </strong>plate and incubated for 22 h at 37 \u00b0C. A single colony was selected and inoculated into 5 mL of <strong>SCFM</strong>. This culture was grown for 26 h shaking at 200 rpm and 37 \u00b0C. Liquid culture from this sample was frozen at a final concentration of 25% glycerol and this frozen stock was used as the <strong>SCFM</strong>-evolved lineage. The growth curves of the <strong>SCFM-evolved lineage</strong> and <strong>isogenic <em>P. aeruginosa</em></strong> in <strong>SCFM </strong>were measured (see <strong>Figure S2C</strong> in the paper associated with this study). Growth rates were calculated with the <strong>growth rates</strong> package in <strong>R[7]</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Collection of conditioned SCFM</strong></p><p>Isolates were streaked from frozen stocks onto <strong>LB agar </strong>plates and incubated overnight at 37 \u00b0C. Single colonies from each plate were inoculated into 5 mL of <strong>LB liquid media</strong> in 50 mL flasks and incubated at 37 \u00b0C with shaking (200 rpm) overnight. Liquid cultures were washed twice in 1 x <strong>DPBS </strong>and a 3rd time in <strong>SCFM </strong>(6000 rpm for 5 minutes). Washed cultures were 20 inoculated into 25 mL of <strong>SCFM </strong>in 500 mL flasks at an OD600 of 0.01 (~104-107 CFU/mL) and were incubated at 37 \u00b0C with shaking (200 rpm) for 24 h. As a <strong>control</strong>, a flask of <strong>SCFM </strong>with no bacteria was also incubated under the same conditions. Stationary cultures were centrifuged (3000 rpm at 4 \u00b0C for 20 min) and supernatants were collected, filter sterilized (22 \u03bcm PES membrane), and stored at 4 \u00b0C. Colony counts were measured at the time of inoculation and just prior to collection of supernatant and reported as CFU/mL (see <strong>Figure S3A </strong>in the paper associated with this study). The OD600 of each washed culture was also measured at the time of supernatant collection (see <strong>Figure S3B</strong> in the paper associated with this study). 7 biological replicates were each collected on a different day, where each replicate started from an individual colony. 4 batches of SCFM were used across the 7 replicates.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1] </strong>Liberati NT, Urbach JM, Miyata S, Lee DG, Drenkard E, Wu G, Villanueva J, Wei T, Ausubel FM.

For precursor selection, MS(n-1) precursors were selected, and S/N Threshold was set at 1.5.&nbsp;Retention time alignment was performed using<strong> </strong>Adaptive curve algorithm<strong> </strong>with maximum shift allowed for 2 min at a mass tolerance of 5 ppm.&nbsp;Compounds were detected at a mass tolerance of 5 ppm and minimum peak intensity threshold was set at 500,000.&nbsp;Preferred ions were set at either [M+H]+1 or [M-H]-1 respectively for positive or negative mode. Compounds were grouped at a mass tolerance of 5 ppm and RT tolerance of 0.2 min was allowed.&nbsp;A QC-based area correction was applied using a Linear regression model with minimum allowable QC coverage of 50% and maximum QC Area RSD allowed was 30%.&nbsp;Peak areas were normalized using constant median.&nbsp;Blank samples were used for detection and identification of background peaks.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Compound annotations were performed by searching the ddMS2 masses in <strong>mzCloud</strong>.

The in-house database contained approximate standards for 550 compounds detected in both positive and negative modes detected on the same Orbitrap mass spectrometer, using similar chromatographic separation. Metabolites were retained and considered sufficiently annotated if they met the following 2 conditions. First, metabolites were required to have an <strong>mzCloud </strong>or <strong>mzVault </strong>score &gt; 60. Second, metabolites were required to have been verified during the 2nd search. If a metabolite was detected in both positive and negative modes, the positive mode was kept and the negative mode was discarded.</p>",
