                "description": "The interactions between Emiliania huxleyi and E. huxleyi virus (EhV) regulate marine carbon and sulfur biogeochemical cycles and play a prominent role in global climate change. As a large DNA virus, EhV has developed a novel 'virocell metabolism' model to meet its high metabolic needs. Although it has been widely demonstrated that EhV infection can profoundly rewire lipid metabolism, the epigenetic regulatory mechanisms of lipid metabolism are still obscure. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) can regulate biological pathways by targeting hub genes in the metabolic processes. In this study, the transcriptome, lipidome, and miRNAome were applied to investigate the epigenetic regulation of lipid metabolism in E. huxleyi cells during a detailed time course of viral infection. Combined transcriptomic, lipidomic, and physiological experiments revealed reprogrammed lipid metabolism, along with mitochondrial dysfunction and calcium influx through the cell membrane. A total of 69 host miRNAs (including 1 known miRNA) and 7 viral miRNAs were identified, 27 of which were differentially expressed. Bioinformatic prediction revealed that miRNAs involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism and a dual-luciferase reporter assay suggested that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) gene might be a target of ehx-miR5. Further qPCR and western blot analysis showed a significant negative correlation between the expression of ehx-miR5 and its target gene PI3K, along with the lower activity of its downstream components (p-Akt, p-TOR, SREBP), indicating that lipid metabolism might be regulated by ehx-miR5 through the PI3K-Akt-TOR signaling pathway. Our findings reveal several novel mechanisms of viral strategies to manipulate host lipid metabolism and provide evidence that ehx-miR5 negatively modulates the expression of PI3K and disturbs lipid metabolism in the interactions between E. huxleyi and EhV.",

Exponentially growing cells (~7.5 x 10^5 cell/mL) were infected with a 1:50 volumetric ratio of EhV99B1 virus lysate to <em>E. huxleyi</em> culture (multiplicity of infection of ~1:1 viral particle per cell).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Sample collection</strong></p><p>At ca. 0-96 h post inoculation (hpi), samples (2 mL) for algal and viral counts were fixed with 1.0% and 0.5% glutaraldehyde (final concentration) respectively, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 \u00b0C until analysis. At ca. 0, 6, 12, 24, 48 and 60 hpi, i.e., the early, middle and late stages in the second lytic cycle when the majority of the cells were infected, 100 mL of the cultures was harvested by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C, and the cell pellets were fixed (4% formaldehyde + 1% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) for 4 h at 4 \u00b0C for sample preparation for transmission electron microscopy. The cell pellets of 1000 mL of cultures at the time points indicated were collected for RNA isolation, protein extraction, biochemical experiments (3 biological replicates) and total lipids isolation (6 biological replicates) by centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 5 min at 4 \u00b0C.

The column temperature was set at 55 \u00b0C. The mobile phases included acetonitrile:water (6:4, v/v) with 10 mM ammonium acetate as phase A and isopropanol:acetonitrile (9:1, v/v) with 10 mM ammonium acetate as phase B. The elution gradient started with 32% B for 1.5 min, then increased to 85% B at 15.5 min, then to 97% B at 15.6 min and kept until 18.0 min. Then, the gradient was quickly changed back to 32% B at 18.1 min and equilibrated for another 1.9 min until the next injection. The elution was maintained for 20 min for each injection with a flow rate of 0.26 mL/min. The sample tray was set at 10 \u00b0C, and the injection volume was 5 \u03bcL.</p>",
