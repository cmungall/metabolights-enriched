                "description": "<p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> Bagging is one of the most important techniques for the production of high-quality fruits. In the act of cultivation, we found a new kind of browning in peel of the apple fruit that occurs before harvest and worsens during the storage period. There are many studies on metabonomic analysis about the browning of storage fruits, but few studies on the mechanism of browning before harvest. This experiment was based on metabonomic studies to explore the effect of bagging on fruit peel browning.</p><p><strong>RESULTS:</strong> In this study, five-year-old trees of \u2018Rui Xue\u2019 were used as materials. Bagging fruits without browning (BFW) and bagging fruits with browning (BFB) were set as the experimental groups, non-bagging fruits (NBF) were set as control (CT). Our results show that 131 metabolites of BFW were significantly up-regulated and 217 metabolites were significantly down-regulated compared with NBF; 198 metabolites of BFB were significantly up-regulated and and 178 metabolites were significantly down-regulated compared with BFW (Variable important in projection (VIP) &gt; 1 and p-value &lt; 0.05). The synthesis and accumulation of flavonoids and lipids were significantly changed after bagging; compared with NBF, 11 flavonoids and 6 lipid molecules were significantly decreased in the BFW (top 50 metabolites). Compared with BFW, 11&nbsp;flavonoids and 7 lipids were further decreased in BFB, but, 12 triterpenes were significantly accumulated in BFB. As the peel browning, galactose metabolism, ABC membrane transporter protein, flavonoid biosynthesis and linoleic acid metabolism pathways were significantly changed in BFW and BFB compared with NBF. Physiological indicators show that, compared with NBF, the MDA in peel of BFW and BFB significantly increased by 0.46 times and 2.94 times, respectively; and the cell membrane permeability of BFW and BFB were significantly increased by 15.7% and 28.2%, respectively. We analyzed the expression of related genes in the metabolic pathways of flavonoids, compared with NBF, the flavonoid synthesis genes MdLAR were significantly up-regulated by 2.55 and 9.37 times in BFW and BFB, and the MdANR genes were also significantly up-regulated by 2.33 and 2.69 times, respectively. In addition to this, the downstream&nbsp;flavonoids-related polymeric genes MdLAC7 and MdLAC14 were the most significantly expressed. Compared with NBF, MdLAC7 was significantly up-regulated by 0.43 and 13.88 times in BFW and BFB, and MdLAC14 was also significantly up-regulated by 7.13 and 3.17 times, respectively.</p><p><strong>CONCLUSIONS:</strong> Our findings demonstrated that the microenvironment of fruit was changed by bagging, the destruction of cell structure, the increase of lipid peroxidation of cell membrane, the decrease of&nbsp;flavonoids and the increase of triterpenoids were the main reasons for the browning of peel about bagging 'Rui Xue'.</p>",

The test station owns a warm temperate continental monsoon climate with an altitude of 915 m, annual mean rainfall of 578 mm, and an annual mean temperature of 11.4 \u00b0C. In the middle and late stage of fruit growth, the maximum temperature of atmosphere and inner bag in the daytime was 31.7 \u00b0C, the relative humidity was 40.7% and 35.9%, respectively, the minimum temperature at night was 4.1 \u00b0C and 4.6 \u00b0C, respectively, and the relative humidity was 100%, the details of the date are given in Fig S2 in the paper associated with this study. Scions of 'Rui Xue' were grafted to M26 roots stocks. 5-year-old fruit trees of 'Rui Xue' were used as materials. The trees were cultivated as spindle-shaped (1.5 x 3.0 m). Bagging was conducted in middle of May 2019. The external bag was brown and the inner was red (the specification of fruit bags was 155 mm x 180 mm, the outer paper was 57.0 g wood pulp composite paper, the outer color was pulp color, and the inner color was black, the inner paper was 32.0 g red paper coated with wax on both sides). 3 rows of bagging and without bagging fruits were set as biological repeats, with 10 plants in each line. The fruits were harvested with bags at the mature stage (October, 2019). The bagging fruits without browning (BFW) and bagging fruits with browning (BFB) were randomly selected as the experimental group, non-bagging fruits (NBF) were used as the control (CT). 30 fruits with the same size, maturity, and without any mechanical damage were selected for analysis for each group. The fruit peels of the stalk cavity were sampled with a sterilized scalpel, and then immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 \u00b0C.</p>",
