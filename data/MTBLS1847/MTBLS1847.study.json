                "description": "The commonly observed increased heavy metal tolerance of ectomycorrhized plants is usually linked with the protective role of the fungal hyphae covering colonized plant root tips. However, the molecular tolerance mechanisms in heavy metal stressed low-colonized ectormyocrrhizal plants characterized by an ectomycorrhiza-triggered increases in growth are unknown. Here, we examined <i>Populus \u00d7 canescens</i> microcuttings inoculated with the <i>Paxillus involutus</i> isolate, which triggered an increase in poplar growth despite successful colonization of only 1.9% \u00b1 0.8 of root tips. The analyzed plants, lacking a mantle-a protective fungal biofilter-were grown for 6 weeks in agar medium enriched with 0.75 mM Pb(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>. In minimally colonized 'bare' roots, the proteome response to Pb was similar to that in noninoculated plants (e.g., higher abundances of PM- and V-type H<sup>+</sup> ATPases and lower abundance of ribosomal proteins). However, the more intensive activation of molecular processes leading to Pb sequestration or redirection of the root metabolic flux into amino acid and Pb chelate (phenolics and citrate) biosynthesis coexisted with lower Pb uptake compared to that in controls. The molecular Pb response of inoculated roots was more intense and effective than that of noninoculated roots in poplars.",

For the<strong> NM-Pb</strong> and <strong>M-Pb </strong>treatments, the agar medium was supplemented with 0.75 mM Pb(NO3)2. For the control treatment, nitrogen was compensated for with 0.75 mM NH4NO3. The final pH was adjusted to 5.5.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>In the present study, we used <strong>Paxillus involutus</strong>, which increased in vitro poplar microcutting growth despite the low colonization ratio (Szuba, unpublished results). Fragments of barcoded (data not shown)<strong> P. involutus</strong> mycelium were placed near the freshly transferred poplar microcuttings growing in the 2-layer agar medium. Poplar cultures were grown in a growth chamber at 21 \u00b0C in 60% relative humidity with a 16 h/8 h day/night photoperiod using cool white fluorescent light (150 \u00b5mol m\u22122 s \u22121). Additionally, for the metabolomic study, pure cultures of<strong> P. involutus</strong> were cultivated in darkness in MNM medium on Petri dishes <strong>[1]</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Harvesting and Biometrical, Biochemical and Root Colonization Analyses</strong></p><p>6 wks after inoculation, the leaves, stems and <strong>roots </strong>were weighed. Pooled samples of <strong>roots </strong>and agar medium as well as P. involutus hyphae (from the pure culture) were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u201380 \u25e6C until analysis. For the <strong>M-Pb</strong> treatment, the <strong>root </strong>colonization level was assessed. The <strong>root </strong>tip morpho-type percentage was determined using ImageJ 1.48 v Software (Wayne Rasband, Bethesda, MD, USA) from high-resolution images captured during harvest. Categorization was performed on the basis of the anatomical structure of representative root tip morphotypes (selected during harvest and immediately analyzed under a microscope exactly according to <strong>[1]</strong>). <strong>Root </strong>tips were divided into three categories established during our previous study<strong>[1],[2]</strong>: \u2018<strong>nonmycorrhized</strong>\u2019 root tips and 2 stages of <strong>root </strong>tip colonization, \u2018changed\u2019 <strong>root </strong>tips (root tips devoid of root hairs and covered with fungi\u2014such root tips do not have the fully developed Hartig net) and \u2018fully mycorrhized\u2019 root tips (swollen, shortened root tips with a very well-developed mantle \u2014such phenotypes have a well-developed mantle and Hartig net). Pooled dried leaf (50 \u00b5g; we also analyzed the foliar P level; see <strong>Figure S1 </strong>in the paper associated with this study), stem and root (10 \u00b5g) samples were used to measure the Pb level in terms of both the concentration (\u00b5g/DWg) and content (mg per plant). The Pb translocation factor was calculated according to formula: Sum of Pb contents in stem and leaves (per plant) Root Pb content (per plant) . Mineral analyses were completed with 6 replicates using an inductively coupled plasma time-of-flight mass spectrometer (GBC Scientific Equipment, Hampshire, Braeside, Australia) as described in the previous published paper<strong>[1]</strong>. Agar medium was agitated for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C and then filtered through Miracloth (Millipore). The obtained supernatants were analyzed with an Elmetron CX-551 pH meter (n = 4).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1] </strong>Szuba, A.; Karli \u00b4nski, L.; Krzes\u0142owska, M.; Hazubska\u2013Przyby\u0142, T.

Retention indexes (RI) for each compound were calculated based on the alkane series mixture (C-10 to C-36) analysis. Metabolites were identified by library searches (<strong>NIST </strong>and Fiehn libraries); the analyte was considered identified when the quality threshold was passed, i.e., at a similarity index (SI) above 700 and a matching retention index \u00b1 10. Artifacts (alkanes, column bleed, plasticizers, MSTFA and reagents) were identified analogously and then excluded from further analyses. The obtained data were normalized against the sum of the chromatographic peak areas (using the TIC approach), and the resulting tables were transferred into <strong>Perseus </strong>software (Max Planck). The ion intensities were transformed to&nbsp;log values and filtered for blanks in samples. The missing values in the Perseus data table were replaced (by constant value (0) imputation), and such prepared matrixes were used for the statistical calculations (see below).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Statistical and Bioinformatics Analyses </strong></p><p>Statistical analyses of the biometric features of poplars and Pb levels (as well as leaf pigments and foliar mineral composition; see <strong>Figure S1 </strong>in the paper associated with this study) were performed using <strong>JMP Pro 13.0.0 </strong>software (SAS Institute Inc.). Values were considered significant according to T tests or ANOVA/post hoc HSD tests (\u03b1 = 0.05). Statistical calculations for the molecular data (proteomic and metabolomic analyses) were performed in <strong>Perseus </strong>software. The log values (for information on data matrix preparation, see above) were analyzed using two-sample T tests and/or multisample ANOVA (\u03b1 = 0.05; FDR = 0.05). Only the significantly differentially abundant compounds were subjected to a hierarchical analysis. For clustering analysis, data were normalized using the Z-score algorithm.</p>",
