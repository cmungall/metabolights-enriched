                "title": "Discovering potential urinary biomarkers of tomato consumption using untargeted metabolomics",
                "description": "Tomatoes are one of the most consumed vegetables in the United States, making them an economically and nutritionally important crop. Previous epidemiological and intervention studies have suggested positive health outcomes associated with tomato consumption. To more conclusively understand the relationship between tomato intake and health benefits, an accurate measurement of tomato consumption is required. Current methods rely on self-report dietary assessments which suffer from recall bias or, plasma lycopene analysis which lacks reliability. Urine sampling allows an objective, non- invasive assessment of dietary intake, resulting in a more robust determination of consumption. Untargeted metabolomics allows for detection of differences in small molecules between groups without preconceived bias, allowing for several classes of compounds to be evaluated as potential biomarkers. The objective of this study was to discover putative urinary biomarkers of tomato consumption using untargeted metabolomics. Healthy subjects (n=11) were evaluated on two separate days: on each day they consumed a controlled diet with either red or tangerine tomato juice with breakfast. Two varieties of tomato juices were included in order to understand how variation in tomato source contributes to intake biomarkers observed. Urine was collected at baseline, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 hours. UHPLC-QTOF-MS was used to compare osmolality-normalized urine samples at each time point. Data was collected in both positive and negative modes for comprehensive coverage of metabolites. Raw data was processed using MZmine2. Univariate and multivariate statistical approaches were applied to understand which metabolites were significantly different between urine pre- and-post-tomato consumption. Feature lists were reduced to those that met all three of the following criteria: the compound was significantly different (p<0.05) at every timepoint compared to baseline; the compound had a fold change greater than 2 at every timepoint compared to baseline; the compound had a VIP score greater than 1 for the Partial Least Squares Regression model. We found 99 metabolites in ESI (+) and 46 metabolites in ESI (-) that met these criteria. Online databases were consulted as a first attempt at identifying unknown compounds. Data-independent MS/MS analysis was conducted to generate fragmentation patterns to support feature identification. Authentic standards for naringenin-4-O-glucuronide and naringenin-7-O-glucuronide confirmed their identities in both modes compared to pooled 6 hour urine. Previously reported compounds in urine after tomato consumption, N-caprylhistidinol and N-caprylhistidinol glucuronide were also identified in positive mode with a level 2 confidence, giving more support for future investigation into these compounds as biomarkers. Several compounds from the features of interest reduced lists could be tentatively identified as metabolites that had undergone phase II reactions prior to urinary excretion. Additional studies will need to be done to test the robustness, analytical performance, stability, and reliability of these compounds.",

Subjects were instructed to avoid lycopene-containing foods (including tomatoes) for 14 days leading up to each day-long intervention. Subjects were fed either 94 g of red (Solanum lycopersicum&nbsp;L., hybrid derived from OH8245 x OH 8243) or 505 g of tangerine (Solanum lycopersicum&nbsp;L., hybrid FG10314) tomato juice with breakfast. Juice volumes were dosed so that each provided 10 mg of total lycopene. Tomatoes were grown at The Ohio State University (OSU) North Central Agriculture Research Station, Fremont, OH, harvested, and processed into juice at the OSU Food Industries Center Pilot Plant (Columbus, OH, USA)[1]. Table 1 lists the components of each meal consumed by study participants. Breakfast was consumed after baseline urine collection and provided 521 kcal, 30 g protein, 11.7 g fat, 77 g carbohydrates and 5.7 g fiber[1]. Lunch was fed 4.5 h after breakfast and provided 692 kcal, 42 g protein, 1.6 g fat, 127 g of carbohydrates and 7.8 g fiber[1]. Dinner was also provided and was free of tomato products. Values were calculated using the Nutrient Data System for Research software (University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA).</p><p><br></p><p>Upon arriving to the clinic, overnight fasted subjects provided a urine samples representing a baseline or without tomato consumption. Additionally, urine was collected postprandially, at 3, 6, 9, 12 and 24 h after tomato meal consumption. The urine collected was done cumulatively, where all urine was collected in the same container, and aliquoted separately at each timepoint. For example, h 6 was a combination of all the urine collected at baseline, 3 and 6 h. The 24-h urine is then the total amount of urine collected. In total, for 11 subjects, there were 132 samples collected, 22 at each timepoint. Urine was collected with boric acid to serve as a preservative and allow storage at room temperature during the collection period.</p><p><br></p><p>Ref:</p><p>[1] (Cooperstone et al., 2015)</p>",

The freezing point depression method works as such: as the concentration of solutes in a solution increases, the freezing point decreases. The change in freezing point is used to calculate the concentration of solutes. Samples were diluted to with LC-MS grade water to standardize the concentrations to 100 mOsm. Samples were centrifuged again at 21,130 x&nbsp;g&nbsp;for 5 min before analysis. Process blanks were prepared using LC-MS grade water that was run through the same processes and tubes as the samples.

Raw data files were converted from Agilent *.d files into *.mzML files using ProteoWizard MSConvert[2] before importing into MZmine2. Features were deconvoluted using a Wavelet Transform and the noise level set. The ADAP chromatogram feature was used to build chromatograms by defining the number of scans a mass must be detected in, the intensity threshold that mass must meet, the minimum height the peak must have, and the mass tolerance for difference between data points. Chromatograms were further deconvoluted by setting a signal-to-noise ratio and estimator, setting an area threshold, and defining peak duration and retention time wavelet ranges. The retention time was cropped to remove the solvent front and re- equilibration time from the run using the Feature List Rows Filter. The Isotope Grouping feature was used to ensure isotopes of the same feature were not listed as separate compounds. Retention time and m/z tolerances were set, as well as the maximum charge state. Samples were then aligned using the Join Aligner feature. Retention time and&nbsp;m/z&nbsp;tolerances were set again, along with weights assigned to each, with the m/z tolerance being weighted more than retention time. The Feature List Rows Filter was used again, this time to set the minimum number of rows a feature must be seen in. In this case, it was set at the number of QC samples, as the feature should be seen in at least all of those and some samples. The Gap Filling Peak Finder feature was used to re-search the chromatograms to ensure peaks were picked if they were missed after the first pass. Features that were seen in the blanks were removed. Features that were not seen in at least 50% of one timepoint and in 80% of the QCs were also removed. Meaning, a feature needed to be seen in at least 11 of 22 samples of at least one timepoint and in 15 of 18 QCs. Missing values were imputed to be half of the lowest value. Data was log10&nbsp;transformed and Pareto scaled.</p><p><br></p><p>Refs:</p><p>[1] (Pluskal et al., 2010)</p><p>[2] (Chambers et al., 2012)</p>",

A pool of all 6-h urine samples was used for targeted analysis as most of the features of interest were more abundant at 6 h vs. any other timepoint postprandially. Compounds were identified by matching spectra to authentic standards when available. Identification of compounds was attempted by comparing masses to databases, previously reported literature and MS/MS fragmentation. Authentic standards were purchased for 2 compounds, naringenin-4-O-glucuronide and naringenin-7-O-glucuronide. Full scan data was collected for the pooled 6-h sample as well as the standards and their masses and retention times compared to confirm identification.
