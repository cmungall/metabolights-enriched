                "description": "As metabolic rewiring is crucial for cancer cell proliferation, metabolic phenotyping of patient-derived organoids is desirable to identify drug-induced changes and trace metabolic vulnerabilities of tumor subtypes. We established a novel protocol for metabolomic and lipidomic profiling of colorectal cancer organoids by LC-QTOF-MS facing the challenge of capturing metabolic information from minimal sample amount (< 500 cells/injection) in the presence of extracellular matrix (ECM). The best procedure of the tested protocols included ultrasonic metabolite extraction with acetonitrile/methanol/water (2:2:1, v/v/v) without ECM removal. To eliminate ECM-derived background signals, we implemented a data filtering procedure based on p-value and fold change cut-offs which retained features with signal intensities >120% compared to matrix-derived signals present in blank samples. As a proof-of-concept, the method was applied to examine the early metabolic response of colorectal cancer organoids to 5-fluorouracil treatment. Statistical analysis revealed dose-dependent changes in the metabolic profiles of treated organoids including elevated levels of 2'-deoxyuridine, 2'-O-methylcytidin, inosine and 1-methyladenosine and depletion of 2'-deoxyadenosine and specific phospholipids. In accordance with the mechanism of action of 5-fluorouracil, changed metabolites are mainly involved in purine and pyrimidine metabolism. The novel protocol provides a first basis for the assessment of metabolic drug response phenotypes in 3D organoid models.",

For cell metabolomics and viability analysis, <strong>organoids </strong>were dissociated to single cells using the TrypLE Express enzyme (Fisher Scientific/gibco, Paisley, UK). Disaggregation was stopped with advanced DMEM/F12 and cells were counted. Cells were suspended in growth factor-reduced MatrigelTM (Corning, Bedford, MA, USA) and the complete culture medium (3:1, v/v). For the protocol evaluation experiments cells were cultured for 3 days in 300 \u00b5L of the complete medium prior to analysis. For the proof-of-concept experiments and the viability analysis, a 5-FU stock solution (10 mM 5-FU in water) was diluted with complete medium to final concentrations of 1, 10 and 100 \u00b5M 5-FU. After preculturing of the cells for 3 days in 300 \u00b5L of complete medium, the medium was replaced by 300 \u00b5L of the corresponding 5-FU solution or by the complete culture medium for control&nbsp;(0 \u00b5M 5-FU). The organoids were treated for 24 h and then subjected to the metabolomics analysis. The proof-of-concept experiments were performed in 3 independent biological replicates (passage number 39-72). The CellTiter Glo 3D cell viability assay (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) was used to analyze cell viability according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. In brief, an equal volume of reagent was added to the culture medium, mixed thoroughly, incubated for 30 min at room temperature, and transferred into opaque-walled 96-well plates. The intensity of luminescence was measured using the EnSpire plate reader (PerkinElmer, Hamburg, Germany). In addition, cell death was analyzed using the NucRed Dead 647 ReadyProbes Reagent (ThermoFisher Scientific, Eugene, OR, USA). The reagent was added to the culture medium, incubated for 15 min, and brightfield and fluorescence images (excitation: 642 nm, emission: 661 nm, Cy5 filter cube) were acquired from each well of the 48-well plate using a Cytation 1 Cell Imaging Multi-Mode Reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA).

                        "description": "<p><strong>Sampling and Extraction Procedures</strong></p><p>3 <strong>protocol </strong>variants were compared to find an optimized procedure. The extraction was mainly based on a 2D-cell metabolomics protocol reported by Ivanisevic et al.<strong>[1] </strong>modified as described below. Each <strong>protocol </strong>was performed on 5 <strong>organoid </strong>sample replicates and 3 <strong>ECM blanks </strong>(<strong>extracellular matrix without organoids</strong>). The samples were collected at room temperature to avoid premature <strong>ECM </strong>liquefaction. Sample extraction and analysis was performed in a randomized manner. <strong>Protocol A</strong>: After removal of the culture medium, 1000 \u00b5L of cold PBS (4 \u00b0C) was added to each well. Liquefied <strong>ECM </strong>and organoids were carefully resuspended and transferred into a BSA-coated polypropylene tube (ThermoFisher Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA) sitting on ice. For transfer BSA-coated pipette tips were used. Samples were centrifuged (30 s, 2,370 \u00d7 g, 4 \u00b0C) and the supernatant (PBS-ECM-suspension) was removed. The organoid pellet was resuspended in 100 \u00b5L of MeOH/ACN/H2O (2:2:1, v/v/v) by vortex mixing for approximately 5 s followed by snap-freezing in liquid nitrogen. Samples were stored in liquid nitrogen until further processing. The samples were thawed at 4 \u25e6C and cells were extracted by ultrasonication (ultrasonic wave output power: 320 W, ultrasonic on/off cycles: 0.5 min, total disruption time: 4 min and T = 4 \u00b0C; Bioruptor UCD-200, Diagenode s.a., Li\u00e8ge, Belgium). In order to precipitate proteins, the samples were incubated for at least 30 min at \u221220 \u00b0C, followed by 5 min centrifugation at 21,130 \u00d7 g and 4 \u00b0C. The resulting supernatant was removed and transferred to a fresh tube. The pellet was resuspended in 100 \u00b5L MeOH/ACN/H2O (2:2:1, v/v/v) on a vortex mixer (approximately 5 s) and centrifugation was repeated. The supernatants were combined and divided in equal aliquots used for HILIC and RPLC analysis. <strong>Protocol B</strong>: The samples were extracted as described in <strong>protocol A.</strong> The remaining organoid pellet was resuspended in 100 \u00b5L of MTBE/MeOH (3:1, v/v) on a vortex mixer (approximately 5 s) and re-extracted by ultrasonication using the same parameters as before. After centrifugation at 21,130 \u00d7 g and 4 \u00b0C the supernatant was combined with the aliquot intended for RPLC analysis. <strong>Protocol C</strong>: After removal of the culture medium, the surface of the ECM and of the well were washed with 500 \u00b5L of warm PBS (37 \u00b0C), which was immediately removed and discarded. Cells and ECM were resuspended in 500 \u00b5L of ice-cold MeOH/ACN/H2O (2:2:1, v/v/v), transferred to a polypropylene tube (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) and immediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Further sample extraction was performed as described for <strong>protocol A</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Sample Storage and Preparation</strong> </p><p>All extract aliquots were evaporated to dryness in a rotational vacuum concentrator (RVC 2-25 CDplus, Christ, Germany) at ambient temperature and stored at \u221220 \u00b0C until analysis. Prior to analysis the dry extracts were reconstituted in 70 \u00b5L of solvent (HILIC analysis: ACN:H2O (95:5, v/v), RPLC analysis: IPA:MeOH (3:1, v/v)) by vortex mixing (10 min) and ultrasonication (2 min)&nbsp;followed by centrifugation (5 min, 21,130\u00d7 g, 4 \u00b0C). Fifty microliters of the supernatants were transferred into 250 \u00b5L glass inserts with polymer feet in 2 mL sample vials (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany) covered with preslit polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)/silicone screw caps (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany). The remaining extracts of all samples (approximately 20 \u00b5L each) including ECM blanks were pooled to prepare quality control (QC) samples. Optionally, a 50 \u00b5L aliquot was taken for the acquisition of fragmentation spectra while the remaining solution was diluted with the corresponding solvent to achieve an appropriate QC sample volume for monitoring and correction of experimental drifts.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1] </strong>Ivanisevic J, Zhu ZJ, Plate L, Tautenhahn R, Chen S, O'Brien PJ, Johnson CH, Marletta MA, Patti GJ, Siuzdak G.
