                "description": "<p>Infiltrating gliomas are devastating and incurable tumors. Amongst all gliomas, those harboring an isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 mutation (IDHmut), acquire a different tumor biology and clinical manifestation than those that are IDHWT. Understanding the unique metabolic profile reprogrammed by IDH1 mutation has the potential to identify new molecular targets for glioma therapy. Herein, we discovered monounsaturated (MUFA) to polyunsaturated (PUFA) lipid imbalances in organelles, generated by IDH mutation in cells and patient tissue, that were responsible for Golgi and ER dilation. We demonstrated a direct link between the IDH mutation and these organelle morphology via D-2HG-induced stearyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) overexpression, the rate limiting enzyme in MUFA biosynthesis. Inhibition of IDH mutation or SCD silencing restored ER and Golgi morphology, while D-2HG and oleic acid induced morphological defects in these organelles. Moreover, addition of oleic acid, which tilted the balance towards elevated levels of MUFA, produced IDH1mut-specific cellular apoptosis. Collectively, these results suggest that IDH1mut-induced SCD overexpression can rearrange the biodistribution of lipids in the organelles of glioma, providing a new insight on the link between lipids metabolism and organelle morphology in these cells, with potential and unique therapeutic implications.</p><p><br></p><p>Linked studies;</p><p><a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS1967' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>MTBLS1967</a> FA_HILICZ</p><p><a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS1973' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>MTBLS1973</a> LCMS(CSHNeg)</p>",

Organelle pellets were individually sonicated at 40 amps for 0.5 min. Prior to extraction, 100 \u03bcL chilled 50 % MeOH (aq) reagent spiked with qualitative internal standards (qIS) at 0.125 \u03bcg/mL nitrodracylic acid (NDA) and 0.125 \u03bcg/mL isocaramidine sulfate&nbsp;(ICS) was added to each lysate. Samples were vortexed on BenchMixer (Benchmark Scientific, Edison, NJ, USA) at mid-speed (6) for 15 s and incubated on ice for 10 min.&nbsp;Bligh and Dyer biphasic liquid extraction was performed upon the addition of 500 \u03bcL methanol chilled (-20 \u00b0C) LC/MS grade Methanol (MeOH) was added to each followed by 275 \u03bcL chilled (-20 \u00b0C) chloroform. Next, 100 \u00b5L chilled chloroform reagent spiked with qIS, 0.6 \u03bcg/mL phenyl-N-pyridinyl acrylamide (PNPA) was added to each lysate solution and placed on rotating mixer for 60 min on ice. The samples were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 18 min at 4 \u00b0C.&nbsp;The resulting two phases (upper hydrophilic and lower hydrophobic lipid) were separated while the remaining protein disk was discarded. Extracts were concentrated under N2 gas vapor, snap frozen with dry ice and stored at -80 \u00b0C. The hydrophobic organelle extracts were reconstituted in reagent containing 3:1:6 methanol: ACN: water as previously described [1]. Pooled quality control (QC) samples were composed of 10% volume from each sample. Blanks were prepared containing 3:1:6 methanol: ACN: water.</p><p><br></p><p>References:</p><p>[1] Altadill T, Dowdy TM, Gill K, Reques A, Menon SS, Moiola CP, Lopez-Gil C, Coll E, Matias-Guiu X, Cabrera S, Garcia A, Reventos J, Byers SW, Gil-Moreno A, Cheema AK, Colas E.
