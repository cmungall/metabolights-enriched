                "description": "<p>A nano sheath-flow capillary electrophoresis mass spectrometry (CE-MS) system with electrospray ionization was used to profile cationic metabolite cargo in exosomes secreted by non-tumorigenic MCF-10A and tumorigenic MDA-MB-231 breast epithelial cells. CE-MS-based metabolomics revealed increased purine synthesis intermediates and increased carnitine synthesis metabolites in MDA-MB-231-derived exosomes, with pathway enrichment indicating activation of de novo purine pathways and upregulating of carnitine metabolism. In addition, nanoLC-MS-based proteomics revealed differential expression of ecto-5\u2019-nucleotidase (NT5E) and mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH9A1) demonstrated metabolic alterations in related enzymatic steps. This study demonstrates the application of nano sheath-flow CE-MS for comprehensive and quantitative exosome metabolomics, uncovering metabolic reprogramming in purine and carnitine pathways between normal and cancerous breast cell lines and providing insight into exosome-mediated signaling of breast cancer metabolism.</p>",

Mass tolerance was set to 20 ppm and mobility tolerance was 3 mm^2/kV/s (MSDIAL parameter was still RT due to absence of mobility parameter). [M+H]1+, [M+H-H2O]1+, [2M+H]1+ and [M+2H]2+ adducts were included in the analysis. The alignment result was then exported with MS2 as MSP files and imported into MSFINDER for identification. Identification was restricted to human databases, notably, HMDB, with MS2 abundance cutoff of 0.1%. Identified compounds were used to build a library for MSDIAL peak matching. An aligned data set with identifications was exported, and the values were then normalized to the area of the UV peak at 280 nm wavelength. Normalized values were then used for all statistical analyses.</p>",

Injection and processing were performed in the same manner as previously described for all samples. Spectral matching was performed against a library samples. Two criteria were used for validation: match of the MS2 fragments between purified standard and the sample, as well as match of the electrophoretic mobilities. Electrophoretic mobility values were obtained by converting time scale to effective mobilities with ROMANCE algorithm using L-arginine as the internal standard. L-arginine was ubiquitously present in all EV samples as well, allowing for migration time correction even in absence of spiked internal standard.</p>",

Capillary was then fed through the outlet of the cartridge to the MS source, aligning the window with the PDA probe (Figure 3 1-A). The new capillary was conditioned with 60 min wash with isopropanol, 60 min wash with 5 M ammonium hydroxide and 60 min wash with 1 M formic acid. All separations were carried out in 0.5 M formic acid at \u223c357 V/cm electric field. Dry sample was resuspended in 5 \u00b5L of 500 mM formic acid. Prior to sample injection, 500 mM ammonium hydroxide was injected at 2 psi for 20 s. Sample injection was carried out at 2 psi for 40 s.
