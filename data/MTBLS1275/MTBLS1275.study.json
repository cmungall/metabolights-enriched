                "description": "<p>Pathogenic bacteria proliferating inside mammalian host cells need to rapidly adapt to the intracellular environment. How they achieve this and scavenge essential nutrients from the host has been an open question due to the difficulties in distinguishing between bacterial and host metabolites <em>in situ</em>. Here we capitalized on the inability of mammalian cells to metabolize mannitol to develop a stable isotopic labeling approach to track <em>Salmonella enterica</em> metabolites during intracellular proliferation in host macrophage and epithelial cells. By measuring label incorporation into <em>Salmonella</em> metabolites with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, and combining it with metabolic modeling, we identify relevant carbon sources used by <em>Salmonella</em>, uncover routes of their metabolization, and quantify relative reaction rates in central carbon metabolism. Our results underline the importance of the Entner-Doudoroff pathway and the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase for intracellularly proliferating <em>Salmonella</em>. More broadly, our metabolic labeling strategy opens novel avenues for understanding the metabolism of pathogens inside host cells.</p>",

Only cells below a passage number of 15 were used for all experiments. For infection experiments, cells were seeded and treated in a medium with 1 g/L glucose and 0.11 g/L sodium pyruvate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 11885084) containing 10% heat-inactivated (and dialyzed for metabolomics experiments) FBS (Sigma-Aldrich, F0392).</p><p><br></p><p>The bacterial wt used was Salmonella enterica subsp.

In brief, for RAW264.7 cell infections, cells were seeded 16-18 h before the infection in 6-well plates (0.9 x 10^6 cells per well) or T-75 flasks (7 x 10^6 per flask). STm were grown overnight with shaking at 37 \u00b0C from a single colony in LB medium. For HeLa cell infections, cells were seeded in 6-well plates (0.2 x 10^6 cells per well) or T-75 flasks (1.6 x10^6 per flask). STm were grown overnight with shaking at 37 \u00b0C from a single colony in LB medium, and sub-cultured (300 \u00b5L overnight culture in 10 mL LB Miller) for 3.5 h at 37 \u00b0C, with shaking at 60 rpm. For RAW264.7 and HeLa infections, bacteria were washed once with PBS and resuspended in the same volume of PBS. Bacteria were added to the host cells at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 100, spun down at 170 x g for 5 min at RT, and incubated for 25 min at 37 \u00b0C to allow for bacterial uptake. Note that this MOI leads to cell death in around 30% of the host cells in 19 h<strong>[2]</strong>, but released bacteria are quickly killed by gentamicin in the medium, and washed away before host cell lysis and bacterial isolation. Therefore they do not contaminate the metabolic signals from the isolated alive bacteria. Cells were then washed once with DMEM medium containing 100 \u00b5g/mL gentamicin and incubated for 1 h with 100 \u00b5g/mL gentamicin in DMEM. After 1 h, the medium was exchanged for DMEM with 16 \u00b5g/mL gentamicin, and 4 g/L mannitol (U-13C-labeled or unlabeled) was added to the medium if applicable.

The samples were incubated in the lysis solution for 5 min, scraped from the flask and the lysate was filtered through a 5 \u00b5m cellulose nitrate filter (Whatman, Puradisc, WHA10462000).

A QC sample was analyzed after every ~5th experimental sample to monitor instrument performance throughout the analytical sequence. For the determination of background signals and subsequent background subtraction, an additional processed blank sample was recorded. Internal standards were used to detect procedural errors, not for data normalization.</p>",

                        "description": "<p>Peak areas of the deprotonated M-H metabolite ions and of all isotopologs (masses determined using Scientific Instrument Services isotope distribution calculator) for each metabolite were quantified on the smoothed extracted ion chromatograms (15 smoothing points) using the XCalibur Quan Browser software (Thermo Fisher Scientific, version 4.1.31.9) with a mass tolerance of 7-10 ppm. Areas of non-detected peaks were set to NF.</p><p><br></p><p>All subsequent data analysis was done using Matlab. Based on the comparison between our standard and a faster isolation protocol, we considered the following metabolites as unreliable for the quantification of MIDs from intracellular STm. This selection was based on direct measurements, or on close proximity to an unreliable metabolite in the metabolic network (although the metabolite could not be quantified in this specific experiment): cis-aconitate, citrate, alpha-ketoglutarate, glutamate, glutamine, serine, pyruvate, lactate, alanine, fumarate, aspartate. In addition, to identify real isotopic peaks - as opposed to contaminations or interference from other metabolites - we directly compared the same condition treated with 12C mannitol (unlabeled) and U-13C mannitol. As we generally had low signal intensities, we used the 12C samples to select metabolites for which we could make reliable statements about the quantitative fractional 13C enrichment in the 13C samples. This selection was done based on the detection of the naturally labeled M+1 isotope, and generally, only metabolites were selected for which the M+1 fractional enrichment did not deviate by more than 50% from the theoretically calculated M+1 enrichment (based on the natural 13C isotope abundance of 1.07%<strong>[1]</strong>), except for mannitol 1P and glucose 6P/fructose 6P, which deviated by 79% and 57%, respectively. We chose this relatively high deviation of 50%, as orbitraps are already known to systematically underestimate heavier natural isotopes, up to 20% for the M+1 isotope<strong>[2]</strong>. In general, we expect higher labeling ratios in our data to be more accurate than smaller ones: as most labeled isotopologues showed higher labeling ratios than the naturally occurring 13C, we expect our data to be more accurate than the 50% cutoff. This strict cut-off led to a slightly different set of metabolites that could be quantified in each experiment. In general, the reproducibility and precision between replicates were very high, and we, therefore, decided to measure only 2-3 replicates per condition. Note that we only quantified labeling ratios from isolated bacteria, which are more stable than absolute metabolite levels<strong>[3]</strong>. We corrected all data for the 13C natural isotope and 12C impurity in the fully labeled 13 mannitol using IsoCor<strong>[4]</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p>To obtain the fractional 13C enrichment, we summed the peak areas from all reliably detected isotopes for one metabolite and divided the peak area of each isotope by this sum. Averages and standard deviations were determined from replicates using the Matlab functions mean(), and std(). To determine the total fractional 13C enrichment (TFLE) for one metabolite, we summed the percentages starting from M+1 (= 1 - M+0).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Berglund M, Wieser ME.

This analysis of standards on the LC-MS system allowed us to determine retention times and peak shapes for all metabolites of interest.</p><p><br></p><p>To identify real isotopic peaks - as opposed to contaminations or interference from other metabolites - we directly compared the same condition treated with 12C mannitol (unlabeled) and 13C mannitol. As we generally had low signal intensities, we used the 12C samples to select metabolites for which we could make reliable statements about the quantitative labeling fractions in the 13C samples.</p><p><br></p>",
