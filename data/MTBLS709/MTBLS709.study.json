                "description": "<p>The central aim in ecometabolomics and chemical ecology is to pinpoint chemical features that explain molecular functioning. The greatest challenge is the identification of compounds due to the lack of constitutive reference spectra, the large number of completely unknown compounds, and bioinformatic methods to analyze the big data. In this study we present an interdisciplinary methodological framework that extends ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC/ESI-QTOF-MS) with data-dependent acquisition (DDA-MS) and the automated in silico classification of fragment peaks into compound classes. We synthesize findings from a prior study that explored the influence of seasonal variations on the chemodiversity of secondary metabolites in nine bryophyte species. Here we reuse and extend the representative dataset with DDA-MS data. Hierarchical clustering, heatmaps, dbRDA, and ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey HSD were used to determine relationships of the study factors species, seasons, and ecological characteristics. The tested bryophytes showed species-specific metabolic responses to seasonal variations (50% vs. 5% of explained variation). Marchantia polymorpha, Plagiomnium undulatum, and Polytrichum strictum were biochemically most diverse and unique. Flavonoids and sesquiterpenoids were upregulated in all bryophytes in the growing seasons. We identified ecological functioning of compound classes indicating light protection (flavonoids), biotic and pathogen interactions (sesquiterpenoids, flavonoids), low temperature and desiccation tolerance (glycosides, sesquiterpenoids, anthocyanins, lactones), and moss growth supporting anatomic structures (few methoxyphenols and cinnamic acids as part of proto-lignin constituents). The reusable bioinformatic framework of this study can differentiate species based on automated compound classification. Our study allows detailed insights into the ecological roles of biochemical constituents of bryophytes with regard to seasonal variations. We demonstrate that compound classification can be improved with adding constitutive reference spectra to existing spectral libraries. We also show that generalization on compound classes improves our understanding of molecular ecological functioning and can be used to generate new research hypotheses.</p>",

The additional packages parallel, foreach, doMC, RColorBrewer, multtest, MSnbase, mixOmics, vegan, multcomp and Hmisc were used. The resulting feature matrix was subjected to analysis of metabolite richness and diversity indices by determining the unique chemical entities (those features that are only present in one of the species/seasons but not the others), by calculating the Shannon diversity index H\u2019, and by determining the peak intensities of chromatographic peaks (concentration). To measure how homogeneous metabolite features were distributed, the evenness (or equitability) was determined calculating the Pielou\u2019s J index. To compare the above diversity indices, boxplots were generated for the two study factors species and seasons. To test individual factor levels for significant differences, the Tukey HSD on a one-way ANOVA was performed post-hoc and placed in the upper part of the boxplots.",

Loeske, Fissidens taxifolius Hedw., Grimmia pulvinata (Hedw.) Sm., Hypnum cupressiforme Hedw. (H. lacunosum was not differentiated), Marchantia polymorpha L., Plagiomnium undulatum (Hedw.) T.J. Kop., Polytrichum strictum Menzies ex Brid. and Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus (Hedw.) Warnst. were collected at random locations in the area of the Botanical Gardens of the Martin-Luther-University Halle-Wittenberg. Sampling was performed in spring (2016/04/13), summer (2016/08/08), autumn (2016/11/09) and winter (2017/01/27) at relatively comparable conditions as it is known that short-term climatic fluctuations and rainfall can influence secondary metabolite content and ammonium uptake of bryophytes [1]. Thus, the bryophytes were only collected when there was sunshine at least two days prior to and during sampling. Furthermore, sampling was performed after mid-day between 13:00 and 15:00. In each season, three composite samples of different individuals of each species were taken, leading to a total of 3 * 9 * 4 = 108 samples. Only above-ground parts of the moss gametophytes such as leaves, branches, stems or thalloid parts were taken for sampling. From dioecious species such as M. polymorpha, P. strictum and P. undulatum female, male and sterile gametophytes were collected in a composite sample. Before sampling, visible archegonial and antheridial heads and any belowground parts such as rhizoids and rooting stems were removed with a sterile tweezer. The gametophytic moss parts were put in Eppendorf tubes and were frozen instantly on dry ice and later in the lab in liquid nitrogen.</p><p><br></p><p>Ref:</p><p>[1] Cornelissen JH, Lang SI, Soudzilovskaia NA, During HJ.

Fragment spectra similar in precursor mass (mz difference of 0.01 Da) and retention time (rt error of 5 sec) were merged in each sample. Only compounds with a mass between 50 and 1000 Da and a retention time between 10 and 1020 sec were evaluated. Compound classes of all the grouped MS-MS fragment spectra were determined using classifiers which were created on a training set of ~57,000 MS-MS fragment spectra with known structures from MassBank (Ren\u00e9 Meier, personal communication). As the MassBank does not contain spectra of the group of neolignans (bis-bibenzyls) and sesquiterpenoids are underrepresented for bryophytes, we complemented the library with manually curated spectra of 23 lignans and 27 sesquiterpenoids from known compounds of Marchantia polymorpha. We further annotated these spectra with terms from the ChemOnt ontology using the web tool ClassyFire. Classes from the ChemOnt ontology were used to train a classifier for each compound class determined in the bryophyte samples. Spectra were grouped into a foreground data set containing spectra from compounds which are member of the compound class and a background data set containing the remaining spectra. Only those fragment peaks above an abundance threshold of 100 were used. A simple classifier was trained with the foreground and background data set and the accuracy of the resulting classifier was determined using a stratified random subset validation procedure. To assess the correctness of the classifier, the area under precision-recall curve and the true positive rate for a fixed false negative rate of 5% was determined. The score distribution of the background data set was retained. In the prediction step, the membership of each unknown spectrum in the samples was predicted for each compound class. A p-value based on the score distribution of the background data set was calculated from the training step. Only predictions with a p-value equal or less than 0.05 were kept.\n",
