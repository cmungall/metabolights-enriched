                "description": "<p>Archaea are differentiated from the other two domains of life by their biomolecular characteristics. One such characteristic is the unique structure and composition of their lipids. Characterization of the whole set of lipids in a biological system (the lipidome) remains technologically challenging. This is because the lipidome is innately complex, and not all lipid species are extractable, separable or ionizable by a single analytical method. Furthermore, lipids are structurally and chemically diverse. Many lipids are isobaric or isomeric and often indistinguishable by the measurement of mass or even their fragmentation spectra. Here we developed a novel analytical protocol based on liquid chromatography ion mobility mass spectrometry to enhance the coverage of the lipidome and characterize the conformations of archaeal lipids by their collision cross-sections (CCSs). The measurements of ion mobility revealed the gas-phase ion chemistry of representative archaeal lipids and provided further insights into their attributions to the adaptability of archaea to environmental stresses. A comprehensive characterization of the lipidome of mesophilic marine thaumarchaeon, <em>Nitrosopumilus maritimus</em> (strain SCM1) revealed potentially an unreported phosphate- and sulfate-containing lipid candidate by negative ionization analysis. It was the first time that experimentally derived CCS values of archaeal lipids were reported. Discrimination of crenarchaeol and its proposed stereoisomer was, however, not achieved with the resolving power of the SYNAPT G2 ion mobility system, and a high-resolution ion mobility system may be required for future work. Structural and spectral libraries of archaeal lipids were constructed in non-vendor-specific formats and are being made available to the community to promote research of Archaea by lipidomics.&nbsp;</p>",

Cell growth was monitored by nitrite production, and the purity of the culture was monitored by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analysis<strong>[3]</strong>. Further details have been given in previously<strong>[4]</strong>. Cells were harvested by filtering through a 0.22 \u03bcm Polyvinylidene Fluoride (PVDF) filter (Whatman) after reaching the stationary phase. Filters were stored at -80 \u00b0C until extraction. An MTBE-based lipid extraction procedure is used in this study as it has superseded the chloroform-based approach commonly used<strong>[5]</strong>. MTBE is less toxic than chloroform. It is less dense than water and the organic phase retaining the lipids sits on the upper layer while hydrophilic compounds and salts are enriched in the lower aqueous phase. This allows the collection of the lipid-containing phase without contacting either the aqueous phase or non-extractable residues at the bottom of the extraction tube, and thus affording a contamination-free collection of the two main liquid phases<strong>[6]</strong>. The extraction efficiency is comparable to the Bligh and Dyer protocol<strong>[7]</strong>. A recent study, comparing MTBE and chloroform-based protocols, suggests that the MTBE method is more efficient for glycerophospholipids, ceramides and unsaturated fatty acids, while the chloroform protocol is superior for saturated fatty acids and plasmalogens<strong>[8]</strong>, and thus meeting the challenges and criteria of this work. One caveat of the MTBE method is that MTBE is more polar than chloroform. As a result, a carryover of water is inevitable. It is recommended to use a centrifugal concentrator to reduce the sample to dryness.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> K\u00f6nneke M, Bernhard AE, de la Torre JR, Walker CB, Waterbury JB, Stahl DA.

In the first step, biomass captured on a PVDF membrane was extracted by 4 mL of MTBE and 1.2 mL methanol (10:3, v/v) in a clean Teflon tube (Thermo Scientific Nalgene Oak Ridge high-speed centrifuge tubes). The tube was placed on a tube revolver (Thermo Scientific) and rotated for 1 h. Thereafter, 1 mL of water was added to the extract to induce phase separation. The extract was vortexed and centrifuged to allow the partition of polar metabolites and lipids into the aqueous and organic phases. The upper organic phase was collected in a clean Teflon tube, whereas the lower aqueous phase and the biomass were re-extracted two additional times. The combined organic fraction was reduced to dryness using a centrifugal concentrator (Christ RVS 2-18 CD plus, Osterode am Harz, Germany) and the dried samples were stored at -30 \u00b0C until analysis. The aqueous fraction was discarded. Samples were reconstituted in 150 \u00b5L of methanol. A total of 100 \u00b5L was transferred to a sample vial, the remaining was pooled to prepare a QC sample. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Matyash V, Liebisch G, Kurzchalia TV, Shevchenko A, Schwudke D.

Solvent A was methanol and solvent B was ethanol. Both solvents were modified with 0.1% aqueous ammonia and 0.04% formic acid. The strong wash solvent was 2-propanol. The linear gradient started at 100% A, held for 4.0 min, then increased to 50% B at 10.0 min, and further increased to 99% B at 30.0 min and held for another 4.0 min. The gradient returned to 100% B at 34.1 min and re-equilibrated for 2.0 min. The flow rate was 0.40 mL/min. The column temperature was maintained at 45 \u00b0C. The sample manager was maintained at 7 \u00b0C. </p><p><br></p><p>A reverse-phase liquid chromatographic method was adopted with chromatographic gradient modified to reduce analytical time<strong>[1]</strong>. An analytical ACE Excel 2 SuperC18 column from Advanced Chromatography Technologies Ltd, Aberdeen, Scotland, was used. It had been demonstrated that this chromatographic method has higher performance for archaeal ether lipid analysis relative to a normal-phase chromatographic method based on a diol column<strong>[1]</strong>. The SuperC18 column was also found to perform better (lower back pressure) than a similar CORTECS C18 column from Waters despite having a slightly larger particle size. As a result, an elevated column temperature was not required and the chromatographic resolution was maintained by minimizing longitudinal diffusion.</p><p><br></p><p>Methanol and ethanol were used as the eluents to minimize interferences. This modification was essential as the use of methanol:isopropanol mobile phase and aqueous ammonia modifier as previously reported was found to extravagate background interferences under ion mobility mode, especially in the mass region 1200-1800 m/z. The reason for this was not known although these interferences were a lot minor in ToF mode when IMS was switched off. Moreover, an ion mobility enhanced data-independent acquisition (DIA) method (HDMSE) was chosen over data-dependent acquisition (DDA) used in the previous studies, as HDMSE offered several advantages over DDA, including the acquisition of fragmentation spectra indiscriminately with the peak\u2019s intensity. The spectral quality of HDMSE spectra should be comparable with MS2 obtained by DDA.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Zhu C, Lipp JS, W\u00f6rmer L, Becker KW, Schr\u00f6der J, Hinrichs K-U.

Spectral characteristics, including mass errors, isotope similarities, and similarities between experimental and <em>in silico</em> fragmentation spectra, were used for accessing the confidence of the assignment, and a quantitative scoring system was used to estimate the confidence of the metabolite assignments<strong>[2]</strong>. The software calculated the similarity of each spectral characteristic and summed them to an overall confidence score (maximum score 60). Annotations of the spectral features were tentatively assigned from lipid candidates with an overall score \u2265 47.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Schmelzer K, Fahy E, Subramaniam S, Dennis EA.
