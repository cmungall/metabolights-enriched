So far, root exudates have only been studied under artificial conditions due to methodological difficulties. In this study, each five perennial grass and forb species were investigated for polar metabolites in exudates under field conditions. Therefore, exudate samples were measured by liquid chromatography coupled to electron spray ionisation quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry and analysed by untargeted metabolite profiling.</p><p><br></p><p>Linked study: <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS866' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>MTBLS866</a></p>",

The phytometer were harvested in 50 of the 54 established plots (in total 389 individual plants) as follows. We dug a hole of ca. 20 cm depth and 15 cm length and width to extract one individual, carefully removed the rhizosphere soil and roots of other plants and gently washed the roots with tap water. As the plants were only 3 months in the field by the time of harvest, the roots did not grow into other patches and could be easily extracted from the soil and surrounding plants. Therefore, it was possible to extract the phytometer plants completely without damaging their roots. Afterwards, the phytometers were gently washed with tap water, prepared for exudation and then individually separated into roots, shoots (including flowers and fruits) and leaves. Fresh weight of the three parts was assessed. ",

To reduce the content of ions from the tap water, we performed a second wash step of the roots with deionised water. Afterwards, the complete roots of the intact plant were placed in 250 ml brown plastic vessels (Nalgene) containing 200 ml of deionised water of HPLC quality for 2 hours exudation followed by freezing and storage of the solution at -20\u00b0C. Plastic vessels containing deionised water of HPLC quality were treated as the exudate samples and used as identifier for signals of non-plant-exudate origin (blanks, water control). An internal standard stock solution containing 20 \u00b5g/mL 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and 10 \u00b5M Ribitol were added immediately after exudate collection in the field. After thawing the sample solutions, each was filtered (Sartorius; 185mm, 80g/cm3) and evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure (30 mbar) at 40 \u00b0C by vacuum rotary evaporator. Metabolites were dissolving two times in 100 % methanol (Sigma-Aldrich) and sonicating for 10 min at 20 \u00b0C. The residue was evaporated to dryness at 40 \u00b0C using a vacuum centrifuge, followed by the and reconstitution in 80% MeOH. Remaining particles were precipitated by centrifugation. 10 \u00b5l of each exudate sample of each exploratory were pooled as a quality control sample (QC). An aliquot was subjected to LC-MS analyses.</p><p><br></p><p>References:</p><p>[1] Aulakh, Reiner Wassmann, C. Bueno &amp; Heinz Rennenberg. Plant and Soil<strong> </strong>2001;230:77\u201386.</p>",

The following instrument settings were used: nebulizer gas: nitrogen, 1.6 bar; dry gas: nitrogen, 6 l/min, 190 \u00b0C; capillary: -4000 V; end plate offset: -500 V; funnel 1 RF: - 200 Vpp; funnel 2 RF: - 200 Vpp; in- source CID energy: 0 eV; hexapole RF: - 100 Vpp; quadrupole ion energy: -5 eV; collision gas: nitrogen; collision energy: -7 eV; collision: - 150 Vpp; transfer time: 70 \u00b5s; pre pulse storage: 5 \u00b5s; spectra rate: 3 Hz.\n\nSelected features (species specific metabolites, see identification) were used to obtain fragment spectra for substance identification (species specific compounds). Therefore, exudate samples and water controls (blanks) were pooled according to their affiliation to the ten species and three exploratory sites. The pooled samples were used for acquisition of fragment mass spectra by collision induced dissociation (CID) mass spectrometry. The analysis was performed on a MicrOTOF\u2013Q I hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer also equipped with an Apollo II electrospray ion source (Bruker Daltonics, www.bruker.com). Argon was used as collision gas. Product ions were detected using the same instrument settings as described above. CID mass spectra were acquired at first by automated data dependent MS/MS with an isolation width of \u00b1 3-15 m/z and fragmentation inside the collision cell with an applied collision energy in the range of 15\u201370 eV. Additional CID mass spectra were acquired by scheduled precursor ion list (SPIL) dependent MS/MS with an isolation width of \u00b1 3-15 m/z and fragmentation inside the collision cell with an applied collision energy in the range of 15\u201370 eV. SPIL were prepared according to the statistical selection of species specific compounds. ",

Features occurring in 50 % of water controls were excluded from the metabolite list.\nFeatures occurring only in samples of one species (or in one genus in case of Gallium spp) were subjected to MS as well as CID MS measurements (see Mass spectrometry) and were processed with MetaboScape 3.0.1 software (Bruker Daltonics).\nT-Rex 3D algorithm with following settings: Intensity threshold 1500, minimum peak length 7 spectra, minimum peak length recursive 7 spectra, minimum of features for extraction 2, no log mass calibration, primary ion M-H-, expected ions M+Cl-, M+Na-H-, M+K-H-, ions for pseudo spectra M-H-H2O, M+ HCOOH-H-, EIC correlation 0.8, mass range 90 \u2013 1001, RT range 0.01-18. In a first step, the most probable elemental composition was calculated with MetaboScape 3.0.1\u2019s Smart Formula algorithm (Bruker) and a putative annotation of compounds was performed automatically by MetaboScape 3.1\u2019s 'Annotate with analyte list' and 'Annotate to spectral library' functions. These program uses in-house library of measured standards and previously identified metabolites containing m/z values, RT, precursor ion and fragment ions of measured MS and CID spectra. In a second step, MS/MS spectra of compounds (limited to the species specific metabolites) were exported and processed with MetFamily metabolite classification online software [Treutler et al, 2016]. There, fragment spectra were grouped according to their m/z fragment similarity by hierarchical clustering and jaccard distance. Putative classification of metabolites was done manually based on the grouping diagnostic fragments and neutral losses, either by searching for them in the in-house library or using expert knowledge. </p><p><br></p><p>References: </p><p>[1] Treutler, H., Tsugawa, H., Porzel, A., Gorzolka, K., Tissier, A., Neumann, S., Balcke, G.
