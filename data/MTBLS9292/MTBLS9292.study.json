                "description": "<p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> Diarrhea is common in infants, particularly, children less than 2 years old. Intractable or protracted infancy diarrhea is typically associated with feeding intolerance and malabsorption that is lethal for newborns. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of baizhu shaoyao decoction in reducing functional diarrhea induced by weaning stress, while also delving into its potential mechanisms of action.</p><p><strong>RESULTS:</strong> Piglets were allocated into 5 groups, with each group receiving designated medication for a continuous 14-day period: control, zaohu powder, as well as low-, medium- and high-dose baizhu shaoyao decoction groups (n = 6 piglets per group). To identify diarrhea-related biomarkers, microbial communities, functions and metabolites were compared between the early-weaned piglets (control group) and those treated with 1.28 g/kg baizhu shaoyao decoction (medium-dose baizhu shaoyao decoction group). Our findings revealed significant shifts in microbial composition, function and metabolic profiles in piglets from the medium-dose baizhu shaoyao decoction group, intricately associated with the host's diarrhea status. Furthermore, carbohydrate metabolism and biosynthesis, lipid and amino acid metabolism, glycan activity and carbohydrate digestive enzymes exhibited downregulation in piglets of the medium-dose baizhu shaoyao decoction group compared to those in the control group. Transcriptome analysis highlighted the pivotal role of the FoxO1/3 transcription factor in mitigating weaning stress, particularly through the augmentation of CD4+/CD8+ T cell proportions. Our findings underscored that baizhu shaoyao decoction's therapeutic effects on weaning stress involve intestinal barrier restoration, modulation of brain-gut peptide expression and a reduction in mast-cell activity in the ileum.</p><p><strong>CONCLUSIONS:</strong> The key metabolites (chenodeoxycholyglycine, chenodeoxycholyltaurine, dinoprost, chenodeoxyglycocholic acid, glycochenodeoxycholic acid, glycocholic acid, N-choloylglycine, 5-trans-PGE2, Pregnanediol 3-O-glucuronide, spermidine and spermine) exhibited strong correlations with the abundance of <em>Clostridia_bacterium</em> and <em>Lachnospiraceae_bacterium</em>, emphasizing the significance of <em>Clostridia_bacterium</em> and <em>Lachnospiraceae_bacterium</em> in gut metabolism and function. Besides, this study suggests the potential efficacy of baizhu shaoyao decoction in addressing early post-weaning stress-induced diarrhea in infants, showcasing promising prospects for translational and clinical applications.</p>",

These were used in a weight ratio of 6:4:3:2, respectively. The raw materials were procured from Beijing Tong Ren Tang Chinese Medicine Co., Ltd (Beijing, China). Initially, the ingredients were soaked in distilled water, 8x their volume, for 1 h and then boiled twice for 30 min. The resulting solution was filtered through 16 layers of gauze. Finally, the supernatant was collected and lyophilized using a laboratory freeze dryer (SCIENTZ-10ND, Xinzhi Biological Co., Ltd). The active agents in BSD were identified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-LTQ-Orbitrap-MS. The dried powder was stored in a -80 \u00b0C refrigerator (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Animal experiments</strong></p><p>In total, Bama minipigs (PN18) aged 18 days and weighing 2.5-3.5 kg were weaned from their sow. These weaned piglets were housed in pens with Tenderfoot flooring (3.7 x 2.7 m, with 3 pigs per pen) under controlled conditions of temperature (21 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C) and humidity (60% \u00b1 10%). The piglets were randomly divided into 5 groups: the control group (administered orally with normal saline), Zaohu powder (ZHP) group (administered 1 g/kg ZHP as a positive drug), BSD-L group (administered 0.64 g/kg BSD orally), BSD-M group (administered 1.28 g/kg BSD orally) and BSD-H group (administered 2.56 g/kg BSD orally). All administrations were conducted once a day for 14 days, and body weight measurements were recorded on days 1, 4, 7, 10 and 13. On day 14, the piglets were anesthetized using ketamine (15 mg administered intramuscularly) and then euthanized by an intra-cardiac injection of phenobarbitone (65 mg/kg) to facilitate the collection of tissue and serum samples. All animal experiment protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of China Agricultural University (Aw72012202-2-5, Beijing, China).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Untargeted metabolites</strong></p><p>The ileum samples of the piglets were used for metabolite extraction<strong>[1]</strong>.

LC-MS raw data files were converted into mzXML format and then processed by the XCMS, CAMERA and metaX toolbox implemented with the R software. Each ion was identified by combining retention time (RT) and m/z data. Intensities of each peaks were recorded and a 3D matrix containing arbitrarily assigned peak indices (retention time-m/z pairs), sample names (observations) and ion intensity information (variables) was generated. The intensity of peak data was further preprocessed by metaX. Those features that were detected in less than 50% of QC samples or 80% of biological samples were removed, the remaining peaks with missing values were imputed with the k-nearest neighbor algorithm to further improve the data quality. PCA was performed for outlier detection and batch effects evaluation using the pre-processed dataset. Quality control-based robust LOESS signal correction was fitted to the QC data with respect to the order of injection to minimize signal intensity drift over time. In addition, the relative standard deviations of the metabolic features were calculated across all QC samples, and those &gt; 30% were then removed.</p>",
