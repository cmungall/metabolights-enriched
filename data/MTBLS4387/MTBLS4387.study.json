                "description": "<p>Malaria varies in severity, with complications ranging from uncomplicated to severe malaria. Severe malaria could be attributed to peripheral hyperparasitemia or cerebral malaria. The metabolic interactions between the host and <em>Plasmodium</em> species are yet to be understood during these infections of varied pathology and severity. An untargeted metabolomics approach utilizing the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry platform has been used to identify the affected host metabolic pathways and associated metabolites in the serum of murine malaria models with uncomplicated malaria, hyperparasitemia and experimental cerebral malaria. We report that mice with malaria share similar metabolic attributes like higher levels of bile acids, bile pigments, and steroid hormones that have been reported for human malaria infections. Moreover, in severe malaria, upregulated levels of metabolites like phenylalanine, histidine, valine, pipecolate, ornithine and pantothenate, with decreased levels of arginine and hippurate, were observed. Metabolites of sphingolipid metabolism were upregulated in experimental cerebral malaria. Higher levels of 20-hydroxy-leukotriene B4 and epoxyoctadecamonoenoic acids were found in uncomplicated malaria, with lower levels observed for experimental cerebral malaria. Our study provides insights into host biology during different pathological stages of malaria disease and would be useful for the selection of animal models for evaluating diagnostic and therapeutic interventions against malaria.</p>",

For all the experiments, mice of 4-6 weeks of age weighing around 20-25 g were used. They were housed at about 25 \u00b0C with a 12\u2009h light/dark cycle, provided with a pellet diet and clean water. All infection experiments were performed at the BSL-2 facility housed inside the animal house of KIIT School of Biotechnology. For metabolomics experiments involving BALB/c, a total of 27 mice were used (uninfected control-8, PyXNL infected-8 and PyXL infected-11). For experiments involving C57BL/6 mice, a total of 19 mice has been used (uninfected control-6, PbA infected-13). Mice that died (2 PyXL infected BALB/c and 1 PbA infected C57BL/6) before the collection of samples for the metabolomics experiments have not been included in the above groups.</p><p><br></p><p>To initiate infection, the cryopreserved parasites were injected intraperitoneally into the mice used for passage. When the parasitemia of the passaged mice reached around 5-7%, 10^6 parasites diluted in PBSH (PBS with 10 U/mL heparin) were injected intraperitoneally into the experimental mice. The control mice were injected with the same amount of PBSH.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Sample collection and storage</strong></p><p>Parasitemia in experimental mice was monitored daily, starting from day 4 post-infection. Bleed was collected from <em>P. yoelii </em>17XL infected BALB/c mice at day 6 post-infection. All the <em>P. yoelii </em>17XL infected mice had parasitemia of \u226540% at day 6 post-infection. Simultaneously, bleed from <em>P. yoelii</em> 17XNL infected BALB/c mice were collected at day 6 post-infection. For the cerebral malaria model, the day for bleeding was selected based on the observed behavioral pattern and Rapid Murine Coma and Behavior Scale (RMCBS)<strong>[1]</strong>. RMCBS consisted of 10 parameters, with each parameter to be evaluated with a score between 0-2. The lowest score depicted low performance. To avoid biases or mistakes in evaluation, the RMCBS were evaluated by 2 independent operators. Only those mice with RMCBS value less than 12/20, were selected for the study.</p><p><br></p><p>Any mice that died before the collection of bleeds for the lethal strains were not used in the study. For daily parasitemia monitoring, caudal vein blood was used, whereas the final blood was obtained by retro-orbital bleeding. Blood obtained from the animals was allowed to clot and the serum was collected, aliquoted into tubes, and stored at -80 \u00b0C until further use. The effect of Plasmodium infection on RBC count was also evaluated by a hemocytometer (measuring the hematocrit).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Carroll RW, Wainwright MS, Kim KY, Kidambi T, G\u00f3mez ND, Taylor T, Haldar K.
