                "description": "Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is a heterogeneous disease with 50-80% patients exhibiting mutations in the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene. RSUME (RWD domain (termed after three major RWD-containing proteins: RING finger-containing proteins, WD-repeat-containing proteins, and yeast DEAD (DEXD)-like helicases)-containing protein small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) enhancer) acts as a negative regulator of VHL function in normoxia. A discovery-based metabolomics approach was developed by means of ultraperformance liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MS) for fingerprinting the endometabolome of a human ccRCC cell line 786-O and three other transformed cell systems (<i>n</i> = 102) with different expressions of RSUME and VHL. Cross-validated orthogonal projection to latent structures discriminant analysis models were built on positive, negative, and a combination of positive- and negative-ion mode MS data sets. Discriminant feature panels selected by an iterative multivariate classification allowed differentiating cells with different expressions of RSUME and VHL. Fifteen identified discriminant metabolites with level 1, including glutathione, butyrylcarnitine, and acetylcarnitine, contributed to understand the role of RSUME in ccRCC. Altered pathways associated with the RSUME expression were validated by biological and bioinformatics analyses. Combined results showed that in the absence of VHL, RSUME is involved in the downregulation of the antioxidant defense system, whereas in the presence of VHL, it acts in rerouting energy-related pathways, negatively modulating the lipid utilization, and positively modulating the fatty acid synthesis, which may promote deposition in droplets.",

Stable clones were obtained as described elsewhere<strong>[1]</strong>, transfecting RCC 786-O cells with pcDNA3-shScramble/shRSUME or pcDNA3-Flag-VHL-shScramble/shRSUME, leading to 4 cell lines: RCC 786-O cells silenced for endogenous RSUME (786-O shRSUME); RCC 786-O cells with endogenous RSUME levels (786-O scramble); RCC 786-O cells re-expressing VHL and silenced for endogenous RSUME (786-O VHL shRSUME); and RCC 786-O cells re-expressing VHL with endogenous RSUME levels (786-O VHL scramble). Cells were cultured in DMEM (pH=7.3) supplemented with 10% FBS, 2.2 g/l NaHCO3, 10 mM HEPES, 4 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. All cells were cultured at 37 \u00b0C, in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Cells were regularly tested for mycoplasma. 3 different culture media preparation batches were used. The protocol designed for cell culture and endometabolome analysis generated 30 samples for each cell line. 3 cryovials with similar cell passage number were thawed for each cell line. Cells from each cryovial were split into 5 flasks and were treated independently during the experiments. After cell counting, 2 plates were plated for each cell line. Culture media blanks were obtained by incubating cell culture media using the same protocol (see Fig. S1 in the paper associated with this study).</p><p><br></p><p>Cells were counted and cultured in 10 cm plates. Once 80% confluence was reached, cells were gently washed 3 times during 10 min with DMEM culture media, without FBS, antibiotics and phenol red. Then, cell monolayers were incubated overnight with 5 ml of culture media under starving conditions<strong>[2]</strong> (without FBS) and without phenol red or antibiotics.</p><p><br></p><p>Conditioned media (culture media modified by overnight cell incubation) were harvested and aliquoted in conic microtubes of 400 \u00b5l and immediately frozen at -80 \u00b0C for further analysis. For endometabolome analysis, cells were washed twice with 5 ml of PBS solution and once with 5 ml of ultrapure water at 37 \u00baC in a fast way to reduce cross-contamination and matrix effects while minimizing perturbation of the metabolic steady state of the cells<strong>[3]</strong>. Subsequently, cells were carefully scraped with 2 ml of cold (-20 \u00b0C) methanol:acetonitrile (50:50 v/v); 1.4 ml of the resulted suspension were sonicated on a water-ice bath to complete cells lysis, incubated for 15 min at 0 \u00b0C, and centrifuged at 16,000 x g for 20 min at 4 \u00b0C. The supernatant was splitted into 2 aliquots of 640 \u03bcl, and frozen at -80 \u00b0C after the addition of 800 \u03bcl of ultrapure water in each tube. Process blanks were prepared using plates without cells that were subjected to the sample preparation protocol described above. Lyophilization blanks consisted of ultrapure water. Samples and blanks were stored at -80 \u00b0C until lyophilization.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Gerez J, Tedesco L, Bonfiglio JJ, Fuertes M, Barontini M, Silberstein S, Wu Y, Renner U, P\u00e1ez-Pereda M, Holsboer F, Stalla GK, Arzt E.

The procedure included retention time alignment, peak picking, deisotoping, integration, and grouping together adducts derived from the same compound. Based on previous findings<strong>[1]</strong>, different adduct ions with NaCl were also considered for this step [M+xNaCl-H]\u2212, [M+xNaCl+Cl]\u2212, [M+xNaCl+H]+, [M+xNaCl+Na]+) in addition to ionic species that are typically observed in ESI.</p><p><br></p><p>2 feature matrices were obtained from positive and negative data sets. Different curation steps were applied to these data. First, a 100% detection rate filter was applied to intra-study QC samples, i.e., features that were not detected in all intra-study QC samples were discarded. In addition, signals from salt clusters based on their mass defect were removed<strong>[2]</strong>. As endogenous metabolites may contain phosphate, sulfur and iodine, exhibiting high mass defect, an 'inclusion list'<strong>[2]</strong> was used to account for them. Subsequently, QC sample-based robust LOESS (locally estimated scatterplot smoothing) signal correction (QC-RLSC) was applied to correct for instrumental drift during analysis using intra-study QC samples<strong>[3]</strong>. Afterwards, if a feature had a peak area in a sample that was 3-fold or less than the mean peak area in blanks, then its peak area was set to 0.32. Otherwise, the mean peak area in blanks was subtracted from the feature peak areas in the samples. After blank subtraction, only those features that were present in at least 80% of 1 group class were retained. In addition, features with RSD &gt; 30% in intra-study QC samples were removed. Chromatographic peak shape and signal intensity of each feature was further evaluated for data curation. Features with signal intensity &lt; 10^3 in the continuum mass spectra or with a mass difference larger than 10 mDa along the sample list were discarded. Finally, each feature matrix obtained after this procedure was normalized to the total peak area for each sample.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Knott ME, Manzi M, Zabalegui N, Salazar MO, Puricelli LI, Monge ME.

                        "description": "<p>For UPLC-MS/MS experiments, the product ion mass spectra were acquired with collision cell voltages between 6 and 40 V, depending on the analyte. Ultra-high-purity argon (\u226599.999%) was used as the collision gas. Data acquisition and processing were carried out using MassLynx version 4.1 (Waters Corp., Milford, MA, USA).</p><p><br></p><p>Metabolite identification was attempted for the 75 discriminant features resulting from the GA and iPLS-DA variable selection processes. Elemental formulae were generated based on accurate masses and isotopic patterns, and mass spectral adduct ions were searched against the Human Metabolome Database (HMDB)<strong>[1]</strong>, Metlin<strong>[2]</strong> and LIPID MAPS<strong>[3]</strong> databases. Metabolites were identified based on accurate mass, isotopic profiles, fragmentation patterns compared to those obtained from authentic chemical standards in tandem MS experiments, and retention time matching with authentic chemical standards. Experimental MS/MS spectra were compared to databases, and for those cases in which spectra were not available, fragmentation patterns were manually interpreted for metabolite annotation. Chemical standards were prepared in ultrapure water or methanol (1-38 \u00b5M), and were analyzed under identical conditions as samples for validating metabolite identification. Spiking experiments on the study samples were also conducted with chemical standards to address retention time differences caused by matrix effects (see (Figs. S3-S4 of the paper associated with this study). Identification of metabolites was reported according to the Metabolomics Standard Initiative (MSI) identification standards<strong>[4]</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p>Spearman's correlation analysis as well as retention time difference were used to identify those features corresponding to the same compound that were not grouped by Progenesis QI, considering in-source fragmentation and additional adduct ions formed in the source. Peak areas from features that exhibited a pair-wise correlation larger than 0.7, except for 2 adduct ions corresponding to glutathione that were subsequently verified with chemical standards, and features with a retention time difference under 2 s were added and grouped under the label of 'total' metabolite. Through this approach 14 features detected in negative ion mode were identified for glutathione (M); i.e., [M-H]-, [M-SH2-H]-, [M+Na-2H]-, [M+CHO2Na+Na-2H]-, [M+H3PO4+Na-2H]-, [M+H3PO4-H]-, [M+NaH2PO4+Na-2H]-, [M+NaH2PO4+NaCl+Na-2H]-, [M+2NaH2PO4+Na-2H]-, [2M+Na-2H]-, [2M+H3PO4+Na-2H]-, [2M+H3PO4-H]-, [2M+3Na-4H]-, [2M+H3PO4+2Na-3H]- (see Figs. 1A-F and S3-14 in the paper associated with this study). Similarly, 6 features were identified for glutathione in positive ion mode; i.e., [M+H]+, [M-2H+3Na]+, [M+NaH2PO4+Na]+, [M-C5H7NO3+H]+, [M-H2O+H]+, [M-C2H5NO2+H]+ (see Figs. S15-S20 in the paper associated with this study). 2 features were also identified for leucine in positive ion mode; i.e., [M+H]+ and [M-CH2O2+H]+ (see Fig. S21 in the paper associated with this study).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Wishart DS, Tzur D, Knox C, Eisner R, Guo AC, Young N, Cheng D, Jewell K, Arndt D et al.
