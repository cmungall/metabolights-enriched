                "description": "<p><strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong> To decrease antibiotic resistance, their use as growth promoters in the agricultural sector has been largely abandoned. This may lead to decreased health due to infectious disease or microbiome changes leading to gut inflammation.</p><p><strong>OBJECTIVES:</strong> We aimed to generate a m/z signature classifying chicken health in blood, and obtain biological insights from the resulting m/z signature.</p><p><strong>METHODS:</strong> We used direct infusion mass-spectrometry to determine a machine-learned metabolomics signature that classifies chicken health from a blood sample. We then challenged the resulting models by investigating the classification capability of the signature on novel data obtained at poultry houses in previously unseen countries using a leave-one-country-out (LOCO) cross-validation strategy. Additionally, we optimised the number of mass/charge (m/z) values required to maximise the classification capability of Random Forest models, by developing a novel ranking system based on combined univariate t-test and fold-change analyses and building models based on this ranking through forward and reverse feature selection.</p><p><strong>RESULTS:</strong> The multi-country and LOCO models could classify chicken health. Both resulting 25-m/z and 3784-m/z signatures reliably classified chicken health worldwide. Through mummichog enrichment analysis on the large m/z signature, we found changes to amino acid metabolism, including branched chain amino acids and polyamines.</p><p><strong>CONCLUSION:</strong> We reliably classified chicken health from blood, independent of genetic-, farm-, feed- and country-specific confounding factors. The 25-m/z signature can be used to aid development of a per-metabolite panel. The extended 3784-m/z version can be used to gain a deeper understanding of the metabolic causes and consequences of low chicken health. Together, they may facilitate future treatment, prevention and intervention.</p>",

Per chicken, 4 drops of blood were sampled in independent spots on \u201cWhatmantm 903 Protein Saver Cards\u201d blood spot cards (BSC) (Sigma-Aldrich Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany). Countries were selected based on availability of on-site experts to perform the sampling and willingness of local farmers to participate in the experiment. Furthermore, the participating countries were important chicken-producing countries in their respective continents and thus well suited for an initial impression of the variation present in chicken metabolomes. In general, each continent uses a different basal feed composition based on agricultural availability, which was an additional reason for including multiple countries across continents.</p><p><br></p><p>Sampling was performed by the country broiler expert/coordinator together with the local farmer. Prior to sampling, instructions and BSCs, together with sealing bags, moisture indicators and desiccant bags were sent by the UMC Utrecht team to the country expert/coordinator. The instruction video provided to the on-site experts for sampling can be found at https://tinyurl.com/bscumc.</p><p><br></p><p>In this rather uncontrolled field experiment, we wanted to capture a maximum amount of variation, to understand whether metabolic health classification is feasible on the basis of the perceived overall health status of the broilers as classified by the local farmers and country experts. Rather than registering specific characteristics, country experts registered a healthy (\u2018high\u2019 health) and unhealthy (\u2018low\u2019 health) label for each chicken, on the basis of several commonly seen and widely accepted characteristics:&nbsp;reduced animal size relative to the farm average, rough feathers, reduced activity and/or presence of dirty feathers near the vent.</p><p><br></p><p>Each farm sampled 50% healthy and 50% unhealthy chickens regardless of on-site health distribution. Blood was drawn through syringe from the brachial wing vein and dripped onto the BSC. In total, Brazil supplied 98 BSCs distributed across 10 farms, Italy supplied 30 BSCs distributed across 5 farms and Spain supplied 69 BSCs distributed across 7 farms.</p><p><br></p><p>After being dried at room temperature, ranging from 5 h to overnight, the BSCs were stored in sealed plastic bags with desiccant and moisture level monitoring cards and stored at 4 \u00b0C. After collection of cards from all farms within a country was completed, they were shipped to the UMC Utrecht (transit time: 2-7 days) for further processing, Upon arrival BSCs were stored at -80 \u00b0C until analysis. BSCs on which the blood spots were not dripped as instructed or those that contained smears were excluded from the analysis.</p>",

Using the <strong>xcms</strong> package, files were divided into positive and negative mode scans based on the available metadata<strong>[1]</strong>. Samples with a low total intensity in either positive or negative mode were excluded from further analysis.</p><p><br></p><p>Scans were aligned to each other per mode and replication, using a list of m/z values observed in &gt; 80% of samples, only found in internal standards. The spectra of each mode were then added together, yielding one positive and one negative spectrum per sample. Per sample, the <strong>MALDIQUANT</strong> program was used to call peaks<strong>[2]</strong>. Next, all of the files associated with the aforementioned experiments were gathered, and a summary of all peak tables was created. To facilitate statistical analysis, spectra were binned/aligned to each other using <strong>MALDIQUANT</strong> at 2 ppm (parts per million).</p><p><br></p><p>The binned spectra were combined into a table and exported to a <strong>MetaboShiny</strong>-supported table. Only the peaks observed in 2/3 technical duplicates were kept, and the peak signals of the replicates were averaged. A table including data on the day-of-run batch and injection order was also exported for batch correction purposes. The raw file pipeline can be found on <strong>Github</strong> for SLURM-supporting compute clusters in the '<strong>joannawolthuis/MassChecker</strong>' repository.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Filtering and normalization</strong></p><p>Peaks with more than 20% missing samples were excluded from the analysis. Peak intensities were quantile adjusted for each sample and then autoscaled to Z-score format per m/z value. The <strong>waveICA</strong> package was then used to correct any batch effect, using both the day-of-run batch and injection order<strong>[2]-[5]</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Domingo-Almenara X, Siuzdak G.
