                "description": "An antipsychotic drug, Thioridazine has been shown to inhibit a broad spectrum of cancer cells. However, its molecular mechanism is still not well understood. In the present study, we have shown that thioridazine induces cytostatic effects in both parental and tamoxifen-resistant cancer cells through cell viability, cell count, caspase activation, cell cycle analysis and enhanced p21 levels. Further, using the pharmacometabolomics approach, we identified that thioridazine induces phospholipids accumulation in breast cancer cells. We proved that thioridazine induces only phospholipids accumulation and not neutral lipids in cells by using lipid-specific fluorescent quantification and image analysis. The accumulation of phospholipid induces necroptosis, which was assessed by propidium iodide uptake assay. Thioridazine activates RIP1 and RIP3 signalling and subsequent translocation of pore-forming MLKL to the plasma membrane to initiate necroptosis induction. The MLKL-induced membrane pores were confirmed using a scanning electron microscope cell surface visualization. Further, thioridazine co-treatment enhances the efficacy of tamoxifen in resistant breast cancer cells potentiating its usefulness for combinatorial treatment",

After incubation, the cells were trypsinized and mixed with 10 \u00b5L of an isotope-labeled internal standard (IS) mixture. To this, 750 \u00b5L of a chilled methanol-water solution (4:1 ratio) was added and the cells were lysed using a probe sonicator. Subsequently, 450 \u00b5L of chilled chloroform was added, and the mixture was vortexed for 3 min. Following this, 150 \u00b5L of chilled water was added, and the mixture was vortexed again for 2 min. A two-phase liquid-liquid extraction method was employed to separate metabolites and lipids. The methanol-water mixture was used to extract polar metabolites, while chloroform was utilized to extract lipids from the cells. The resulting solution was incubated at -20 \u00b0C for 30 min. After incubation, the samples were centrifuged at 5000 RPM and 4 \u00b0C for 10 min to separate the methanol and chloroform layers. Both layers were collected into the same centrifuge tube and vacuum-dried at 30 \u00b0C. The dried residue was reconstituted in 500 \u00b5L of a methanol-water solution (1:1 ratio). Amicon filters, preconditioned with 500 \u00b5L of methanol-water solution (1:1 ratio), were used for sample cleanup. The reconstituted sample was added to the filter, centrifuged at 10,000 rpm and 4 \u00b0C for 45 min, and the filtrate was discarded. The final filtration was vacuum-dried and reconstituted in 100 \u00b5L of methanol-water solution (1:1 ratio) before injection into the mass spectrometry system</p>",
