                "description": "<p>Cellular senescence affects many physiological and pathological processes and is characterized by durable cell cycle arrest, an inflammatory secretory phenotype and metabolic reprogramming. Here, by using dynamic transcriptome and metabolome profiling in human fibroblasts with different subtypes of senescence, we show that a homeostatic switch which results in glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) and phosphoethanolamine (PEtn) accumulation links lipid metabolism to the senescence gene expression program. Mechanistically, p53-dependent glycerol kinase (GK) activation and post-translational inactivation of Phosphate Cytidylyltransferase 2-Ethanolamine (PCYT2) regulate this metabolic switch, which promotes triglyceride accumulation in lipid droplets and induces the senescence gene expression program. Conversely, G3P phosphatase (G3PP) and Ethanolamine-Phosphate Phospho-Lyase (ETNPPL)-based scavenging of G3P and PEtn acts in a senomorphic way by reducing G3P and PEtn accumulation. Collectively, our study ties G3P and PEtn accumulation to controlling lipid droplet biogenesis and phospholipid flux in senescent cells, providing a potential therapeutic avenue for targeting senescence and related pathophysiology.</p>",

The medium was changed every 2 days. Cells were split as they reached a confluency of 70-80%. Experiments were performed on cells at a population doubling level (PDL) inferior to 45 divisions (except for the replicative senescence model). WI-38-ER:RASV12 fibroblasts were generated by retroviral transduction as previously described<strong>[1]</strong>. RAS-OIS was induced by adding 400 nM 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) to the culture medium. The doxycycline- inducible oncogenic BRAFV600E retroviral construct was a gift from Carl Mann (CEA, Gif-sur-Yvette, France). RAF-OIS was induced with 100 ng/mL doxycycline. DNA damage-induced senescence (DDIS) was triggered by etoposide treatment at a concentration of 20 \u03bcM for 2 days. Cells were then washed and incubated with fresh medium without drug. Replicative senescence was obtained through proliferative exhaustion. For the induction of quiescence, WI-38 fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM containing 0.2% FBS. Primary human myoblasts (SkMC) were isolated from a skeletal muscle biopsy of a healthy donor (PromoCell C-12530, Lot 414Z025.11) and were purified with an immuno-magnetic sorting system using CD56/NCAM magnetic beads (Miltenyui Biotec 130-050-401) following the manufacturer\u2019s specifications. The purified CD56-positive myoblasts were seeded in dishes coated with type I collagen (Sigma-Aldrich C 8919) and cultured in the proliferation medium (DMEM-high glucose (Sigma D6429), 20% FBS (Life Technologies 10270106), 50 \u03bcg/mL gentamicin (Life technologies 15750037), 0,5% Ultroser G (PALL 15950-017) at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2. All experiments were conducted CPD11 and CPD29 to avoid replicative senescence, and myoblasts were passaged at a cell confluency not exceeding 50% to avoid myogenic differentiation. Retroviral infections were performed as outlined for WI38 fibroblasts. For all the indicated treatments of fibroblasts and myoblasts, cells were collected and processed at the indicated time points.</p><p><br></p><p>Metabolomics data which includes four senescence onset and quiescence models; RAS-OIS cells treated with DMOG or shPCYT2, overexpressing G3PP, PCYT2 or ETNPPL and etoposide-induced cells treated with Rapamycin. Cells were washed 2 times with ice cold DPBS and were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 \u00b0C before the extraction.</p><p><br></p><p>Targeted metabolomics analyses were focused on small polar compounds in central carbon metabolism. Established methods for sample extraction and LC-MS analyses using pHILIC HPLC column for polar metabolites separation were used<strong>[2]</strong>. As a part of the routine analytical pipeline, recommendations of the metabolomics Quality Assurance and quality Control Consortium (mQACC) were applied: the routine quality controls include regular equipment maintenance (Thermo), the use of standard operating procedures for sample extraction, storage and analyses. General practices also include weekly test runs to assure system stability and quality of runs. Several QCs were used (1) pooled interstudy QC, (2) process and extraction blanks, (3) system stability blanks, (4) solvents blanks, (5) long-term reference standard inter-laboratory QC mix to ensure system stability and (6) the samples were blinded and loaded in randomized order. The analyses of pooled samples QC showed no significant difference in metabolites levels between QCs.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Mart\u00ednez-Zamudio RI, Roux PF, de Freitas JANLF, Robinson L, Dor\u00e9 G, Sun B, Belenki D, Milanovic M, Herbig U, Schmitt CA, Gil J, Bischof O.
