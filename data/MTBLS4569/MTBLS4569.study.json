                "description": "<p>Metabolites are important determinants of disease progression. In this study, we conducted a case-control study to explore permanent teeth caries-related differences in salivary metabolite profiles and related changes in the composition of the oral microbiota in 200 subjects including 100 caries-free individuals and 100 with moderate-to-severe caries with good homogeneity through widely targeted metabolomics and 16S rRNA deep sequencing technologies. We found that: 1) 822 metabolites were detectable in salivary samples from these participants, of which 4-acetamidobutyric acid and adipic acid were respectively enriched in healthy individuals and individuals with caries, exhibited the greatest area under the curve (AUC) values of &gt; 0.970; 2) less diversity was observed in individuals with dental caries relative to caries-free individuals, and significant differences in the dominant taxa were evident between the two groups. For example, the healthy oral microbiome is enriched for <em>Rothia aeria</em> and <em>Neisseria perflava</em>, whereas <em>Prevotella melaninogenica</em>, <em>Streptococcus salivarius</em>, <em>Streptococcus parasanguinis</em> and <em>Prevotella histicola</em>, and <em>Streptococcus mutans</em> were enriched in individuals with caries; 3) <em>Prevotella histicola</em>, <em>Oribacterium asaccharolyticum </em>and<em> Rothia aeria</em> were the top 3 species being required to differentiate caries from caries free population; 4) adipic acid and 4-acetamidobutyric acid derived from microbiota and host-microbiota co-metabolism, respectively. A negative correlation was observed between the microbes enriched in caries individuals (such as <em>Prevotella histicola</em>) and 4-acetamidobutyric acid. Moreover, the upstream regulatory factor ALDH of 4-acetamidobutyric acid is expressed throughout the entire process of tooth development including the differentiation of tooth bud, ameloblasts and odontoblasts. Together, these results suggest that 4-acetamidobutyric acid and adipic acid are important targets for future caries-focused research, offering insight into cariogenic activity or risk assessment in moderate or severe cases.</p>",

This study received ethical approval from Bengbu Medical College ([2021] KY172), and was conducted as per the STROBE guidelines. The sample size required for caries evaluation among college students was calculated according to formula: N=(Z\u03b1/2/\u03b4)2P(1-P). The values of \u03b1, Z\u03b1/2, and \u03b4 were set as 0.05, 1.96 and 5%, respectively. The prevalence of permanent dental caries in Chinese 15-year-olds was 44.42% according to the 4th National Oral Health Survey<strong>[1]</strong>. We set the caries prevalence of college students at 50%. The calculation showed that the minimum sample size was 385 participants for the investigation of dental caries among college students. In September of 2021, 971 college students from Bengbu Medical College were recruited for this study. To control for the impact of confounding factors on the incidence of caries, participants were asked to complete questionnaires that collected details regarding gender, level of parental education and information pertaining to oral health behaviors (including use of F toothpaste, brushing frequency, flossing frequency and sugar intake frequency). All oral examinations were performed by trained dentists (Kappa value &gt; 0.8). The decayed, missing and filled teeth (DMFT) and Dean\u2019s indices were respectively used to identify dental caries and fluorosis as per WHO (World Health Organization) recommendations. While the decayed, missing and filled surfaces (DMFS) index can survey caries epidemiology with greater sensitivity as compared to the DMFT index, it requires more time to complete. The present study was primarily focused on differentiating between caries susceptible and non-caries groups, followed by the comparison of microbiome and metabolite profiles between these groups. Given that the DMFT index was sufficient for this goal, it was used to complete this study. Caries was recorded based on the presence of a lesion in a fissure or pit, or when smooth surfaces exhibited a distinctive cavity, undermining of the enamel, or detectable floor or wall softening. DMFT scores were used to grade caries severity experiences, with respective scores of 1-3, 4-6 and \u22657 corresponding to mild, moderate and severe caries experience. DT including current caries lesion and filled crown with caries. Dental caries experience was graded using these DMFT scores, with scores of 1-3, 4-6 and \u22657 being respectively classified as mild, moderate and severe<strong>[2][3]</strong>. Caries was identified through a visual examination and confirmed through tactile assessment without any X-ray analyses. Code 0 from the ICDAS II criteria was used to eliminate initial lesion interference in the caries-free diagnostic criteria<strong>[4]</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Metabolomic and microbiome sample collection</strong></p><p>Those participants who provided samples used to conduct metabolomic and microbiome analyses were required to meet the following criteria: (1) participants were free of genetic and systemic diseases; (2) participants were unaffected by dental fluorosis, periodontitis, recurrent oral ulcers or other oral diseases; (3) participants had not undergone fluoride treatment; and (4) participants had not taken any antibiotics or antiseptics within the last 6 months. Of the 160 caries-free individuals without dental fluorosis, 100 caries-free individuals (CF group) were selected at random. Similarly, 100 caries-susceptible individuals (DC group) were selected at random from among the 164 participants with a DMFT index &gt; 3 without dental fluorosis. These participants were chosen as a representative participant subset to conduct all metabolites and microbiome analyses using Wuhan Metware Biotechnology Co. Ltd (Wuhan, China). During the 2 h interval prior to the collection of samples, subjects were told to avoid consuming any food or beverages, and were directed to use sterile water to gently rinse their mouths before sample collection. Samples of saliva were then collected after a rest period of a minimum of 10 min. For each participant, a sterile 5 mL tube was used to collect 3 mL of unstimulated saliva. These samples were then separated into 3 tubes (300 \u03bcL in tube A, 1 mL in tube B with the remainder in tube C), with tubes A and B respectively being utilized to conduct metabolomic and microbial analyses. After collection, samples were rapidly frozen at -80 \u00b0C.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Quan JK, Wang XZ, Sun XY, Yuan C, Liu XN, Wang X, Feng XP, Tai BJ, Hu Y, Lin HC, Wang B, Si Y, Wang CX, Wang WJ, Rong WS, Zheng SG.

LIT and triple quadrupole (QQQ) scans were acquired in positive and negative ion modes with a triple quadrupole-linear ion trap mass spectrometer (QTRAP), QTRAP LC-MS/MS system, equipped with an ESI Turbo Ion-Spray interface under the control of the Analyst 1.6.3 software (Sciex). The ESI source operation parameters were as follows<strong>[1]</strong>: source temperature, 500 \u00b0C; ion spray voltage (IS), 5500 V (positive) / -4500 V (negative); ion source gas I (GSI), gas II (GSII) and curtain gas (CUR) were set at 55, 60 and 25 psi, respectively; the collision gas (CAD) was high. Instrument tuning and mass calibration were performed with 10 and 100 \u03bcmol/L polypropylene glycol solutions in QQQ and LIT modes, respectively. Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode was used to quantitatively analyze metabolite levels. Specific MRM transitions were monitored for each period based upon the metabolites eluted during that period. That is, the characteristic ions of each substance were selected by the triple quadrupole mass analyzer, and the signal intensities were acquired by the detector. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Chen W, Gong L, Guo Z, Wang W, Zhang H, Liu X, Yu S, Xiong L, Luo J.

Qualitative analyses were conducted based on retention time (RT) values, ion pairs and MS2 spectra for identified metabolites utilizing a self-constructed target standard product database MWDB (metware database). Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode was used to quantitatively analyze metabolite levels. MultiQuant 3.03 was used to open off-machine mass-spectra files for samples, followed by the integration and calibration of chromatographic peaks. Peak area for individual chromatograms corresponds to the relative abundance of that metabolite, with integral peak area values being saved. The relative abundance of all detected metabolites in different samples was assessed based upon RT and peak type for each metabolite, with qualitative and quantitative accuracy being ensured through the calibration of chromatographic peaks for each metabolite. A quality control (QC) sample consisting of a mixture of 10 \u00b5L of each prepared sample was analyzed after every 10 sample acquisitions to ensure that these analyses were repeatable. Coefficient of variation (CV) values for the metabolites present within these QC samples were then calculated, with those metabolites exhibiting a CV &gt; 0.5 in positive or negative ion mode being excluded from this analysis. MetOrigin (http://metorigin.met-bioinformatics.cn/) was used to analyze the origins of these metabolites. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG, https://www.kegg.jp/) was used to evaluate the function of target metabolites.</p>",
