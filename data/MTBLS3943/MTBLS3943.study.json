                "description": "<p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> Evidence on the relationship between food processing and health outcomes has been increasing steadily. Under this context, ultra-processing food, such as sugar-sweetened fruity beverages (SS-FB), is associated with a higher risk of metabolic syndrome. However, whether drinking fruit juice not from concentrate (NFC-FJ), which belongs to minimally processed food, causes poor health or not is controversial. The major goal was to determine the impact of fruit drinks with different processing degrees on health via the interaction of gut microbiota and metabolomics.</p><p><strong>RESULTS:</strong> Significant different trends in metabolic syndrome were found between NFC-FJ and SS-FB in a 4-week experiment. NFC-FJ increased alpha diversity and decreased F/B ratio compared to SS-FB. The modulated bacterial taxa by NFC-FJ increased lipid metabolism as well as decreased insulin resistance and inhibited the dimethyl-L-arginine (ADMA) formation from S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM), contributing to a lower risk of metabolic syndrome in rats. However, SS-FB led to a higher risk of metabolic syndrome in rats with increased food intake and weight change. Additionally, SS-FB with the fructose-to-glucose ratio of 1.5 corresponded to an increase in kidney mass and serum C17-sphinganine level, boosting risks for kidney disease. More than 10 times higher flavonoid content in NFC-FJ than SS-FB was caused by processing degrees, which might be partly responsible for the alteration of gut microbiota.</p><p><strong>CONCLUSIONS:</strong> Our results revealed that rich flavonoids in minimally processed fruit juice decreased the risk of metabolic syndrome in rats through the pathway of insulin resistance via gut microbiota alteration, while ultra-processed fruit beverages enhanced the risk of metabolic syndrome. Based on our data, NFC fruit juice should be considered a healthy choice.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Metabolomics assay</strong>&nbsp;is reported in the current study <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS3943' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS3943</strong></a>.</p><p><strong>Lipidomics assay</strong>&nbsp;is reported in&nbsp;<a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS4108' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS4108</strong></a>.</p>",

All experimental procedures described here were conducted following the National Institutes of Health Guidelines on the Care and Use of Laboratory Animal of Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Beijing Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co., Ltd. The approve code is SCXK-2016\u20130006. The permission code is P2021032.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Drinks preparation</strong></p><p>We chose 2 kinds of popular drinks from the local market as the objects of our study. For <strong>FB</strong> (<strong>SS-FB</strong>), its label claims no less than 10% orange juice content. For <strong>FJ</strong> (<strong>NFC-FJ</strong>), its label claims 100% orange juice content. All drinks samples were stored at room temperature and shaken before use.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Animal experiment</strong></p><p>First, 6-8 week-old SD (Rattus norvegicus) rats (male; SPF; the mean weight of 209 g) were purchased from Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co. Ltd (Beijing, China). The animal feeds were purchased from Keao Xieli Feed Co., Ltd (Beijing, China), and the primary nutrients of animal feed are shown in <strong>Table S4</strong> in the paper associated with this study. The rats were kept under controlled light conditions (12 h light-dark cycle) with free access to feed and water throughout the entire intervention.</p><p><br></p><p>The design of drink intervention study is shown in <strong>Figure S5</strong>. The rats were acclimatized for 7 days, and the weight, fasting blood glucose (FBG), total cholesterols (TC), total triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were recorded on the last day of acclimatization. When the rats were adapted to the experiment condition during the first week, body weight, FBG, TC, TG, HDL-C and LDL-C were measured to divide these rats into 4 groups, denoted as <strong>C0</strong>, <strong>control</strong> (C-4W), <strong>FJ-intake</strong> (fruit juice not from concentrate; HJ (NFSQ)) and <strong>FB-intake </strong>(sugar-sweetened fruity beverages; LJ (MZY)), respectively. After grouping, there are no significant differences in these indexes among groups.</p><p><br></p><p>For C0, cecum and serum samples were directly collected after 7 days of acclimatization and stored at -80 \u00b0C until analysis. Then, rats were dissected to obtain kidney, brain, liver, fat, colon, intestine and cecum. The organ mass was recorded and the organs were stored at -80 \u00b0C until analysis.</p><p><br></p><p>The control and 2 intervention groups (control, FJ-intake and FB-intake) proceeded with formal intervention for 28 days. Under the regular diet, the rats were gavaged with normal saline for control, FJ and FB, FJ-intake and FB-intake, respectively (twice per day). Each rat was given the equivalent of one adult (60 kg) drinking 300 mL of drinks a day. The specific volume of gavage was calculated as 31.5 times the volume of each rat's last measured body weight (for example, if the last measured weight of a rat is 0.2 kg, its gavage volume is 6.3 mL per day). During the 28-day diet, the weight, FBG, TC, TG, HDL-C and LDL-C were recorded once per week. On the last day, samples from the 3 groups were collected and stored under the same condition as C0. The organ index was calculated based on the ratio of organ mass to body weight. In total 120 samples of the cecum and serum samples (60 samples each) from all the rats were obtained.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Metabolomics &amp; Lipidomics</strong></p><p>The ultrahigh-pressure liquid chromatography coupled with a quadrupole time-of-flight mass (UHPLCQTOF MS) was performed. The samples were subjected to a reversed-phase chromatography using an LC system (SCIEX, USA). Mass spectrometric analysis was performed with a QTOF MS with a DuoSpray ion source (TripleTOF 6600, SCIEX, USA). Quality control (QC) samples were made by pooling equal aliquots of each sample together in an analytical run. The QC sample was injected and analyzed at regular intervals of every 6 samples in UHPLC-QTOF MS acquisition. These QC sample data were used to monitor the reproducibility and stability of the analytes in samples during the analysis.
