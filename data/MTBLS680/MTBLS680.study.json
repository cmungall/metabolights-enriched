                "description": "<p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> Large-scale, placebo-controlled trials established that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs confer a cardiovascular hazard: this has been attributed to depression of cardioprotective products of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, especially prostacyclin. An alternative mechanism by which nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs might constrain cardioprotection is by enhancing the formation of methylarginines in the kidney that would limit the action of nitric oxide throughout the vasculature.</p><p><strong>METHODS:</strong> Targeted and untargeted metabolomics were used to investigate the effect of COX-2 deletion or inhibition in mice and in osteoarthritis patients exposed to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on the l-arginine/nitric oxide pathway.</p><p><strong>RESULTS:</strong> Analysis of the plasma and renal metabolome was performed in postnatal tamoxifen-inducible Cox-2 knockout mice, which exhibit normal renal function and blood pressure. This revealed no changes in arginine and methylarginines compared with their wild-type controls. Moreover, the expression of genes in the l-arginine/nitric oxide pathway was not altered in the renal medulla or cortex of tamoxifen inducible Cox-2 knockout mice. Therapeutic concentrations of the selective COX-2 inhibitors, rofecoxib, celecoxib, and parecoxib, none of which altered basal blood pressure or renal function as reflected by plasma creatinine, failed to elevate plasma arginine and methylarginines in mice. Finally, plasma arginine or methylarginines were not altered in osteoarthritis patients with confirmed exposure to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs that inhibit COX-1 and COX-2. By contrast, plasma asymmetrical dimethylarginine was increased in mice infused with angiotensin II sufficient to elevate blood pressure and impair renal function. Four weeks later, blood pressure, plasma creatinine, and asymmetrical dimethylarginine were restored to normal levels. The increase in asymmetrical dimethylarginine in response to infusion with angiotensin II in celecoxib-treated mice was also related to transient impairment of renal function.</p><p><strong>CONCLUSIONS:</strong> Plasma methylarginines are not altered by COX-2 deletion or inhibition but rather are elevated coincident with renal compromise.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Murine kidney and plasma UPLC-MS/MS assay</strong> protocols and data are reported in the current study <strong>MTBLS680</strong>.</p><p><strong>Murine and human plasma quantitative L-arginine and methylarginines UPLC-MS/MS assay</strong> protocols and data are reported in <a href=\"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS685\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>MTBLS685</strong></a>.</p>",

All mice were on a C57/BL6 background unless otherwise specified. Male mice, 8 to 20 weeks of age, were used for all experiments. Tamoxifen-inducible Cox-2 KO (ind.Cox-2 KO) mice and their littermate controls (wild-type [WT]) were generated as previously reported[1]. Hyperlipidemic vascular Cox-2 KO (vascular smooth muscle cell [VSMC]/EC Cox-2 Ldlr KO) mice and their control (Ldlr KO) mice were generated as previously reported[2]. Ip KO mice[3] were bred in a homozygous manner, and C57/BL6 mice were used as controls. All animals were fed ad libitum with regular chow diet, unless specified, for the course of study. Mice were kept under a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle. The mice were sacrificed by carbon dioxide asphyxiation and immediately dissected. Kidney cortex and medulla were harvested.\n</br></br>\nInd.Cox-2 KO Study:</br>\nSystolic blood pressure was measured in conscious 16-week-old ind.Cox-2 KO mice and WT by a tail-cuff system. Blood was collected from the vena cava, and then plasma was analyzed for metabolomics analysis. Kidney cortex and medulla from ind.Cox-2 KO were used for metabolomics analysis.\n</br></br>\nCelecoxib and Rofecoxib Study:</br>\nTwelve-week-old C57/BL6 mice started receiving a diet containing celecoxib (100 mg/kg body weight [BW] per day) or rofecoxib (50 mg/kg BW per day) for 8 weeks. Celecoxib and rofecoxib were obtained from Sequoia Research Products. Drug-containing diets were prepared by Teklad laboratory. Systolic blood pressure was measured in conscious mice at the end of the study by a tail-cuff system.

Briefly, 100 \u03bcl of plasma or 50 \u03bcg of tissues was added to 600 \u03bcl methanol/chloroform/water (2:2:1; vol/vol), and the samples were homogenized with a Tissuelyser (Qiagen, UK) for 5 min at a frequency of 20/s and sonicated for 15 min. Water and chloroform (each of 200 \u03bcl) were added to the samples before being centrifuged at 13 300 rpm for 20 min. The resulting aqueous and organic phases were separated from the protein pellets. The extraction procedure was repeated on the remaining protein pellets. Both organic and aqueous phases were collected and evaporated to dryness. The dried samples were stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until further analysis. Half of the aqueous extract was reconstituted in 200 \u03bcl of 10 mmol/l ammonium acetate containing universally 13C- and 15N-labeled glutamic acid (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) at a concentration of 20 \u03bcmol/l.\n</br></br>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Wang X, West JA, Murray AJ, Griffin JL.

The temperature of the autosampler was set to 7 \u00b0C. The mobile phase consisted of solvent A: 0.1% formic acid in HPLC grade water (Sigma-Aldrich) and solvent B: 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile (Sigma-Aldrich). When eluting the column, the following gradient was used: initial conditions were 100% A held for 1.5 min followed by a linear gradient with increase of B to 100% at 4.5 min with re-equilibration for 1.5 min, giving a total run time of 6 min with a flow rate of 400 \u03bcl/min.
