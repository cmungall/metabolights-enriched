                "description": "Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) is the most common type of breast cancer and the leading cause of breast cancer related mortality. In the present study, metabolomic profiles of 72 tissue samples and 146 serum samples were analysed using targeted liquid chromatography multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry (LC-MRM/MS) and untargeted gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) approaches. Combination of univariate and multivariate statistical treatment identified significant alterations of 42 and 32 metabolites in tissue and serum samples of IDC respectively when compared to control. A decent interconnection of metabolomic changes was observed between tissue and serum, indicating a bi-directional interaction of metabolites in IDC. Additionally, 8 tissue metabolites and 9 serum metabolites showed progressive change from control to benign to IDC suggesting their possible role in malignant transformation. We have identified a panel of three metabolites viz. tryptophan, tyrosine, and creatine in tissue and serum, which could be useful in screening of IDC subjects from both control and benign. The metabolomic alterations in IDC showed perturbations in purine and pyrimidine metabolism, amino sugar metabolism, amino acid metabolism, fatty acid biosynthesis etc. Comprehensively, this study provides valuable insights into metabolic adaptations of IDC, which can help to identify diagnostic markers as well as potential therapeutic targets.",

Subjects with cancerous breast tumour were considered as malignant while non-cancerous breast tumour subjects were considered as benign. IDC status of malignant tumours was confirmed by histopathological analysis. Clinical specimens, tissue and serum for IDC and benign groups were collected from the same subjects at the time of the surgery. The tumours selected were appropriately stage and size matched according to new TNM staging system. Normal tissue as a control was obtained from IDC tumour adjacent tissue (2-5 cm away). Control serum samples were obtained from the subjects undergoing breast health check-up at the camp organized by the hospital.",

The blood samples were allowed to clot\nat room temperature and then centrifuged at 1000 x g for 10 min. The clear sera were then transferred into sterile vials, snap frozen and stored at -80 \u00b0C until further analysis.\n</p>\nMetabolite extraction was performed using adding 400 \u00b5l of ice-cold methanol to 50 \u00b5l of serum spiked with 2 \u00b5l of internal standard. This mixture was vortexed and kept overnight incubation at -20 \u00b0C for deproteination. Samples were then vortexed and centrifuged at 14,000 x g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C. The supernatant was collected and filtered through 0.22 \u03bcm nylon filter. The filtrate was collected and dried in SpeedVac.\n</p>\nTissue:</br>\nIn the case of tissue samples, the tumor and normal tissue were collected immediately after surgery and put in the cryovials which were then transported in -20 \u00b0C minicooler from the hospital to the experimental laboratory. Tissue samples were then snap frozen and stored in -80 \u00b0C ultra-low temperature freezer for long term preservation.\n</p>\nTissue samples weighing 50 mg was taken in a homogeniser vial containing zirconium beads. 400 \u00b5l of ice-cold methanol spiked with internal standard d2 L-phenylalanine was added to homogenizer vial. Tissue homogenization was carried out using Precellys homogeniser (Bertin Corp, USA). The following homogenizer program was used: 2 cycles of 6000 rpm for 20 sec and 2 cycles of 6500 rpm for 30 sec, with intermittent cooling on ice between each cycle. The homogenizer vials were then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C. The supernatant was collected and filtered through 0.22 \u03bcm Nylon filter. The filtrate was transferred to the vial and evaporated to dryness using SspeedVac.\n</p>\nThe dried metabolite extract from serum and tissue were dissolved in 50 \u00b5l sample buffer (6.5:2.5:1 Acetonitrile:Methanol:Water) and used for positive ionization mode (HILIC Chromatography). In case of negative ionization mode, the dried metabolite extract from serum and tissue were dissolved in 50 \u00b5l ultrapure water (T3 RPLC Chromatography). For both modes, 10 \u00b5l of the sample was injected using an autosampler.\n</p>\nUntargeted GC-MS</br>\nSample preparation\n50 \u00b5l serum and 50 mg tissue samples, spiked with an internal standard (15 \u00b5l 2-isopropyl-malic acid in water, 1.0 mg/ml) were taken. Metabolite extraction from serum and tissue was performed as described in LC-MRM/MS section above. Alternately, the metabolite extract was collected in a glass vial and dried under a stream of nitrogen gas. 2-step derivatization was carried out to obtain the trimethylsilyl derivatives of metabolites. At first metabolite extract was derivatized to form methylated derivatives by adding 30 \u00b5l of methoxyamine hydrochloride solution in pyridine (20 mg/ml) and incubating for 90 min at 37 \u00b0C. The second derivatization was achieved by adding 30 \u00b5l BSTFA with 1% TMCS to the mixture and heated for 1 h at 70 \u00b0C to yield trimethylsilyl derivatives. 1 \u00b5l aliquot of each sample is injected in the GC-MS.",
