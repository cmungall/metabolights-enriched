                "description": "Marine copepods are central to the productivity and biogeochemistry of marine ecosystems. Nevertheless, the direct and indirect effects of climate change on their metabolic functioning remain poorly understood. Here, we use metabolomics, the unbiased study of multiple low molecular weight organic metabolites, to examine how the physiology of Calanus spp. is affected by end-of-century global warming and ocean acidification scenarios. We report that the physiological stresses associated with incubation without food over a 5-day period greatly exceed those caused directly by seawater temperature or pH perturbations. This highlights the need to contextualise the results of climate change experiments by comparison to other, naturally occurring stressors such as food deprivation, which is being exacerbated by global warming. Protein and lipid metabolism were up-regulated in the food-deprived animals, with a novel class of taurine-containing lipids and the essential polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid, changing significantly over the duration of our experiment. Copepods derive these PUFAs by ingesting diatoms and flagellated microplankton respectively. Climate-driven changes in the productivity, phenology and composition of microplankton communities, and hence the availability of these fatty acids, therefore have the potential to influence the ability of copepods to survive starvation and other environmental stressors.",

                        "description": "Our fully factorial experiment compared the metabolic profiles of 10 replicate groups of 5 wild-caught Calanus spp. stage 5 copepodites (so-called \u2018CVs\u2019) acclimated to 8 \u00b0C and 10 \u00b0C in 0.2 \u00b5m filtered seawater (FSW) to those of replicate groups of CVs incubated in FSW at 8 \u00b0C or 10 \u00b0C that had been equilibrated to ambient air, containing ~380 \u00b5atm pCO2 (ambient hereafter), or air enriched to 1000 \u00b5atm pCO2, for a period of 5 days in the absence of food (6 treatment regimes, n=10 each, total n=60). CO2-enriched air was commercially produced to order (BOC Special Gases, UK). Experimental animals were collected off Stonehaven, NE Scotland (56\u00b057.80N, 02\u00b006.20W) on 23 May 2011 using a 1 m ring net fitted with a 250 \u00b5m mesh net and non-filtering cod-end. The percentage abundance of C. helgolandicus:C. finmarchicus was 55:45 at the time of sampling. Zooplankton were gently concentrated onto a 45 \u00b5m mesh and 60 replicate groups of 5 Calanus spp. CVs were carefully picked into FSW; 30 of these replicates were acclimated to each of the two temperature regimes in ambient FSW for 72 hrs prior to experimentation. We chose to work with CVs to ensure that eggs were not available as a potential food source during our experiment. No attempts were made to distinguish between live C. helgolandicus and C. finmarchicus (Calanus spp. hereafter) because it is not possible to reliably achieve this without inflicting severe stress and/or killing the animals. At the outset of the experiment (t0), 10 replicate groups of 5 animals from the two temperatures were individually concentrated onto a 45 \u00b5m mesh, rapidly transferred into Precellys homogenisation tubes (Stretton Scientific, UK) and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen.\n</p>\nThe experimental setup was conceptually similar to that described previously[1]. Experimental animals were transferred into 500 ml egg production chambers containing FSW at the prescribed temperature and CO2 level, topped up with the appropriate FSW (ambient or 1000 \u00b5atm pCO2) and sealed with an air-tight lid to avoid CO2 out-gassing. These were incubated for 24 hrs and subsequently transferred into fresh FSW at the same temperature and CO2 level after each 24 hr incubation period for a total of 5 days. The experiment was conducted in the absence of food to simultaneously examine the effects of food deprivation. This also avoided any confounding effects of feeding differences between the treatments. At the end of the experiment (t5) animals were collected and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen as described above. All samples were stored frozen at -80 \u00b0C until analysis. The pH of the incubation water was measured at the start and end of each 24-hr period using a Hanna bench top meter (H1859) following calibration using reference standards at pH 4, 7 and 10 (Sigma, UK). Average pH values of the ambient and CO2-acidified experimental seawater were 8.09 \u00b1 0.03 (sd) and 7.76 \u00b1 0.08, respectively; values did not differ between the temperature treatments (F=0.616, df=1, p=0.4337) or between the start and end of each 24 hr incubation period (F=0.100, df=1, p=0.7522).\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Mayor DJ, Matthews C, Cook K, Zuur AF, Hay S (2007) CO2-induced acidification affects hatching success in Calanus finmarchicus.

In brief, 100 \u00b5l methanol (HPLC grade) and 40 \u00b5l water per copepod were added to each sample prior to homogenization using a Precellys-24 ceramic bead-based homogenizer (Stretton Scientific, UK). Thereafter, 50 \u00b5l water and 100 \u00b5l chloroform per copepod were added to each sample, which was vortexed and centrifuged (1800 rcf, 10 min, 4 \u00baC), yielding an upper (polar) and lower (non-polar) fraction for each sample. Each polar fraction was collected into a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube, and the non-polar fraction into a 1.8 ml glass vial. Extraction blanks were also prepared using identical methods except that no biological material was added to the solvents. Two quality control samples were pooled from polar and nonpolar extracts, respectively. All polar samples were dried in a centrifugal concentrator (Thermo Savant, Holbrook, NY), the nonpolar samples under a stream of nitrogen gas. All samples were stored at -80 \u00baC prior to analysis.",

Samples were centrifuged (10 min, 22000 rcf, 4 \u00baC) to remove any particular matter. They were run in a controlled-randomized sequence different from the extraction sequence, in three technical replicates which followed each other immediately. QC samples were run in the beginning, the end, and equidistantly throughout the sequence. Data was acquired at nominal 1E5 resolution from m/z 70-590, in 7 wide SIM (selected ion monitoring) windows. Nonpolar (lipid) samples were taken up in the original volume of methanol/chloroform 3:1, containing 5 % ammonium acetate.

Missing values were imputed into the resulting data matrix using the KNN algorithm via an in-house R script. This matrix would be used for univariate statistics. The matrix was transformed using the generalised logarithm to stabilise the variance across the measured peaks prior to analysis with multivariate statistics.\n</p>\nPrincipal components analysis (PCA) was used initially to assess the overall metabolic differences between the sample groups in an unbiased manner, using the PLS Toolbox (version 5.5.1, Eigenvector Research, Manson, WA, USA) within Matlab (version 7.8; The MathsWorks, Natick, MA, USA). The significance of any group separation along individual principal components was tested using ANOVA and Tukey posthoc tests. Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), a form of supervised multivariate analysis, was performed using the PLS Toolbox, with internal cross-validation (Venetian blinds). The optimal number of latent variables was determined by minimising the classification error and the significance of the predictive models using in-house MatLab scripts. Student t-tests, corrected for a 5% false discovery rate (FDR, Benjamini-Hochberg) using in-house R scripts, were used to confirm the significance of changes in individual mass spectral signals. Corrected p values are reported here as q values.\n</p>\nSignals were putatively annotated with empirical formulae calculated by the MIPack software[1], searching the KEGG[2][3] and LipidMaps[4][5] databases, and confirmed by performing calculations based on the original spectra in Xcalibur 2.0.7 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Many signals that contributed significantly to distinguishing the metabolic profiles of individual treatment groups could not be identified by the combination of database and empirical formula searches. Consequently, further identification of selected metabolites was performed using mass spectrometry (same instrument as above). This utilised wide SIM windows and the m/z values of identified signals for additional high mass accuracy measurement of unknown signals, narrow SIM (nSIM) windows at up to 4E5 nominal resolution for the determination of isotope patterns, and MSn fragmentation using collision-induced dissociation (CID) and infrared multiphoton dissociation (IRMPD).\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Weber, R.
