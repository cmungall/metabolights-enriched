                "description": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the metabolic profiles of yak (Bos grunniens) serum, feces, and urine by using proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR), to serve as a reference guide for the healthy yak milieu. A total of 108 metabolites, giving information about diet, protein digestion, and energy generation or gut-microbial co-metabolism, were assigned across the three biological matrices. A core metabolome of 15 metabolites was ubiquitous across all biofluids. Lactate, acetate, and creatinine could be regarded as the most abundant metabolites in the metabolome of serum, feces, and urine, respectively. Metabolic pathway analysis showed that the molecules identified could be able to give thorough information about four main metabolic pathways, namely valine, leucine, and isoleucine biosynthesis; phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis; glutamine and glutamate metabolism; and taurine and hypotaurine metabolism.",

This is the time of the year when yaks are traditionally slaughtered for meat, due to their optimal health conditions and highest weight.\n</br></br>\n5 specimens of male Jiulong yak (approximately 3 years of age, receiving no supplementation) were randomly selected for the current experiment. The yaks were transported to the abattoir (without modern slaughtering equipment), held in lairage for 24 h (water supplementation until 3 h before slaughtering), and then sacrificed according to the local traditional manual procedures of yak slaughter[1].\n</br></br>\nUpon slaughtering, 10 ml of blood was collected using disposable syringes (10 ml, without clotting activator, Jiangyin Fanmei Medical Device Co., Ltd., Jiangyin, Jiangsu, China) from the abdominal vein and immediately transferred to sterile conical tubes. Blood samples were left at room temperature for 45 min to allow coagulation without centrifugation, and subsequently, the serum was separated from the blood clot. Urine samples were collected by cystocentesis upon direct bladder visualization using a sterile syringe while feces were collected as the animals defecated during the slaughtering process. All the above-mentioned samples were transported in dry ice and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until analysis.\n</br></br>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Wiener G, Han J, Long R.

Meiboom. Gill) filter composed of 400 echoes with a tau of 400 \u03bcs and a 180\u00b0 pulse of 24 \u03bcs, for a total filter of 330 ms. The water residual signal was suppressed by means of presaturation. This was done by employing the cpmgpr1d sequence, part of the standard pulse sequence library. Each spectrum was acquired by summing up 256 transients using 32 K data points over a 7184 Hz spectral window, with an acquisition time of 2.28 s.\n</br></br>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Zhu C, Faillace V, Laus F, Bazzano M, Laghi L.

                        "description": "Differences in water and fiber content among samples were taken into consideration by probabilistic quotient normalization[1], more reliable than the once more common normalization on creatinine. Spectra phase was manually adjusted and a line broadening of 0.3 Hz was appled in Topspin, while the subsequent adjustments were performed in R computational language by means of script developed in-house[2]. The spectra were aligned towards TSP signal (-0.017 ppm). After the removal of the residual water signal, 1H-NMR spectra were baseline-corrected by means of peak detection, according to the \u201crolling ball\u201d principle[3], implemented in the baseline R package[4]. The signals were assigned by comparing their chemical shift and multiplicity with Chenomx software library (Chenomx Inc., Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, ver 8.3), as detailed in Figures S1\u2013S36 in the paper associated with this study.\n</br></br>\nIn order to apply NMR as a quantitative technique[5], the recycle delay was set to 5 s by considering the relaxation time of the protons under investigation. Moreover, while TSP could be used as a reliable internal standard for urine and feces[6], the molecules of the first serum sample analyzed were quantified by means of an external standard, by taking advantage of the principle of reciprocity[7].\n</br></br>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Dieterle F, Ross A, Schlotterbeck G, Senn H.
