                "description": "This study aims to establish a comprehensive, genome-scale metabolic model (GSMM) combining different omics data of different regulatory levels of breast cancer cells in order to elucidate the way that these regulatory levels affect or determine each other. Together with transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics data obtained, fluxomics data was also to be integrated. In order to get the fluxomics data, MCF cells were incubated with either the medium containing [1,2-13C2]-D-glucose or [U-13C5]-L-glutamine for 8 or 24 hours. A good GSMM should answer any perturbations applied; therefore, different incubation conditions should be applied to generate different metabolic profiles that will help to test if the model of breast cancer works well. To this end, MCF cells were either administered oligomycine, which is an ATP synthase inhibitor, or were deprived of glutamine. Cells were counted before and after each incubation time so as to get the cell proliferation curve. Later, at the corresponding time points, cells and media were frozen to measure the concentrations of glucose, glutamine and lactate (not shown in the file) and the mass isotopomer distributions of glutamate, ribose, lactate, amino acids and TCA cycle intermediates (shown in the file). Finally, all these data was combined in order to estimate the flux rates of various reactions within the central carbon metabolism (not shown in the file). The fluxomics data obtained in this way is to be introduced in the GSMM designed.",

Purified RNA was hydrolyzed in 2 N HCl at 100 \u00b0C for 2 hrs and the solvent was evaporated to dryness under airflow. RNA ribose was converted to its ribose aldonitrile acetate derivative after treatment for 30 min at 100 \u00baC with hydroxylamine hydrochloride in pyridine (2% v/v) and then acetic anhydride for 1 hr more. Excess reagent and solvent were removed by evaporation with N2, and the derivatized ribose was redissolved in ethyl acetate just before GC/MS analysis.\n</p>\nLactate from incubation medium:</br>\nIncubation media were acidified with hydrochloric acid and lactic acid was extracted with ethyl acetate and evaporated to dryness under N2 flow. Lactate was derivatized to its lactic acid n-propylamide-heptafluorobutyric ester doing as follows: dried lactate samples were incubated at 75 \u00baC for 1 hr with dimethoxypropane and methanolic HCl. N-propylamine was added to the reaction mixture and heated at 100 \u00baC for 1 hr more. Samples were dried under a stream of N2. Derivative product was extracted with ethyl acetate and filtered through a glass wool packed pipette. Samples were dried under a stream of N2. Precipitates were then treated with dichloromethane and HFB anhydride at room temperature for 10 min. Samples were dried and dissolved in methylene chloride for GC/MS analysis.\n</p>\nGlutamate from incubation medium:</br>\nIncubation media were passed through Dowex-50WX8 columns and amino acids were eluted with 2N ammonium hydroxide. The solutions were evaporated to dryness by blowing air and next resuspended with water. These solutions were passed through Dowex-1X8 columns. Columns were washed with water and glutamate was collected with 0.5 N acetic acid. The acid solutions were evaporated to dryness. Glutamate was converted to its N-trifluoroacetyl-n-butyl ester; samples were heated for 1 hr at 100 \u00baC in butanolic HCl. They were then dried under a stream of N2 and methylene chloride and trifluoroacetic anhydride were added. After 20 min samples were dried under a stream of N2 and were dissolved in methylene chloride for injection into the GC/MS.\n</p>\nAmino acids from incubation medium:</br>\nIncubation media were passed through Dowex-50WX8 columns and amino acids were eluted with 2 N ammonium hydroxide.

They were then dried under a stream of N2 and methylene chloride and trifluoroacetic anhydride were added. After 20 min samples were dried under a stream of N2 and were dissolved in methylene chloride for injection into the GC/MS.\n</p>\nPolar intracellular metabolites (from frozen plates):</br>\n1 ml of cold methanol (100% v/v) was added to the defrost plate. 1 min later 1 ml of cold water was added to the same plate. The content of the plate was scraped and all the content was transferred to a glass tube. Then, cell extracts were sonicated using a titanium probe. 2 ml of cold chloroform was added to the cell lysate and tubes were placed in a shaker for vigorous agitation at 4 \u00b0C for 30 min. Next, tubes were centrifuged and the upper phase containing the polar metabolites was transferred to a separate glass tube. The tubes containing the polar phase were immediately evaporated to dryness under airflow at room temperature. The intracellular polar metabolites were derivatized by adding 50 \u00b5l 2% (v/v) methoxamine hydrochloride in pyridine and shaken vigorously at 37 \u00b0C for 90 min. Next, N-methyl-N-(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (MBTSTFA) + 1% tert-butyldimetheylchlorosilane (TBDMCS) were added and samples were incubated for 1 hr at 55 \u00b0C.
