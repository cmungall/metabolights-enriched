                "description": "<p>Profibrotic proximal tubular (PT) were identified as a unique phenotype of PTCs in renal fibrosis by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Controlling the process of renal fibrosis requires understanding how to manage the S1 subset's branch to the S3 subset rather than to the profibrotic PT subset. Insulin-induced gene 1 (Insig1) is one of the branch-dependent genes involved in controlling this process, although its role in renal fibrosis is unknown. Here, we discovered that tubular Insig1 deficiency, rather than fibroblast Insig1 deficiency, play a detrimental role in the pathogenesis of renal fibrosis in vivo and in vitro. Overexpression of Insig1 profoundly inhibited renal fibrosis. Mechanistically, Insig1 deletion in PTCs boosted SREBP1 nuclear localization, increasing Aldh1a1 transcriptional activity, causing excessive NAD+ consumption and ER enlargement, as well as accelerating renal fibrosis. We also identified nicardipine as a selective inhibitor of Aldh1a1, which could restore NAD+ and maintain ER homeostasis, as well as improve renal fibrosis. Together, our findings support tubular Insig1 as a new therapeutic target for chronic kidney disease (CKD).</p>",

After that, Insig1flox/wt self-crossing produced Insig1flox/flox mice. Kap-Cre (The Jackson Laboratory, stock number: 008781) and S100A4-Cre mice (The Jackson Laboratory, stock number: 030644) was bred with Insig1flox/flox mice to create F1. In order to create renal proximal tubular and fibroblast-specific conditional Insig1 knockout mice (Insig1dKap and Insig1dS100A4 mice), F1 were then bred with the opposite sex of Insig1flox/flox. The control group consisted of Insig1flox/flox mice.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO)-induced fibrosis model</strong></p><p>Briefly, 8-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were put into groups at random: Insig1flox/flox (WT) group, UUO-treated WT group, Insig1flox/flox; Kap-Cre (KO) group and UUO-treated KO group. Mice were anesthetized, and a lateral incision was made on the back. After being exposed, the left ureter was permanently ligated by being secured at 2 locations with a silk suture. As sham controls, similar procedures were performed on sham-operated animals without ureteric ligation. All left renal tissues were gathered for additional examination following a 14 days modeling period. The mice were sacrificed with sodium pentobarbital euthanasia (30 mg/kg, intraperitoneally (i.p.) and kidney tissue were immediately collected for further study.</p>",

For peak picking, the following parameters were used: centWave, m/z = 25/15 ppm, peakwidth = c(10,60)/(5,30), prefilter = c(10,100). For peak grouping, bw = 5/2, mzwid = 0.025/0.015, minfrac = 0.5 were used, In the extracted ion features, only the variables having more than 50% of the nonzero measurement values in at least one group were kept. Differentially abundant metabolites were analyzed using bioinformatics methods, and all procedures were performed by BioNovogene (Suzhou, China).</p>",
