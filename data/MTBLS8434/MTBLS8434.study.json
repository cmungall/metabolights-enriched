                "description": "<p>This study investigated the alleviating effect of Lacticaseibacillus paracasei IMAUJBC1 on hyperlipidemia and explored the associated mechanism by combining microbiome, transcriptomic and lipomic analyses. The high-fat mouse model was established with a high-fat diet (HFD), and the intervention of IMAUJBC1 was conducted for 8 weeks after modeling. The results showed that IMAUJBC1 inhibited weight gain and liver fat accumulation in HFD mice, reduced total cholesterol (T-CHO) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) serum levels, promoted the conversion of liver cholesterol to total bile acid (TBA), and increased fecal T-CHO excretion. The IMAUJBC1 intervention decreased the ratio of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, while the abundance of Alistipes was increased in mice gut microbiome. IMAUJBC1 may alleviate hyperlipidemia through the PPAR signaling pathway, fat digestion and absorption, cholesterol metabolism, and glycerophospholipid metabolism. In summary, IMAUJBC1 can be used as a functional lactobacillus to intervene in hyperlipidemia.</p>",
