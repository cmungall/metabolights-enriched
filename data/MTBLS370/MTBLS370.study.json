                "description": "<p><strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong> Combined infections from <em>Candida albicans</em> and <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> are a leading cause of death in the developed world. Evidence suggests that <em>Candida</em> enhances the virulence of <em>Staphylococcus</em> - hyphae penetrate through tissue barriers, while <em>S. aureus</em> tightly associates with the hyphae to obtain entry to the host organism. Indeed, in a biofilm state, <em>C. albicans</em> enhances the antimicrobial resistance characteristics of <em>S. aureus</em>. The association of these microorganisms is also associated with significantly increased morbidity and mortality. Due to this tight association we hypothesised that metabolic effects were also in evidence.</p><p><strong>OBJECTIVES:</strong> To explore the interaction, we used a novel GC-Orbitrap \u2013 based mass spectrometer, the QExactive GC, which combines the high peak capacity and chromatographic resolution of gas chromatography with the sub-ppm mass accuracy of an Orbitrap system. This allows the capability to leverage the widely available electron ionisation libraries for untargeted applications, along with expanding accurate mass libraries and targeted matches based around authentic standards.</p><p><strong>METHODS:</strong> Optimised <em>C. albicans</em> and <em>S. aureus</em> mono- and co-cultured biofilms were analysed in addition to the fresh and spent bacterial growth media.</p><p><strong>RESULTS:</strong> The targeted analysis experiment was based around 36 sugars and sugar phosphates, 22 amino acids and five organic acids. We detected an additional 22 highly scoring compounds from untargeted analysis.</p><p><strong>CONCLUSION:</strong> Many of the results were as expected \u2013 rapid consumption of glucose and fructose from the medium regardless of the cell type. We also detected trehalose from the untargeted data, only in medium that contained <em>C. albicans</em>, commensurate with it being a predominantly fungal sugar. Notable from the results is that the pentose phosphate pathway appears to be enhanced in the cells from co-cultured biofilms.</p>",

C. albicans was sub-cultured on Sabouraud\u2019s dextrose (SAB) agar (Fluka Analytical, India) and grown at 37 \u00b0C for 48 h and maintained at 4 \u00b0C. Broths were prepared by inoculating yeast peptone dextrose (YPD) medium (Sigma Life Sciences, USA), followed by incubation at 37 \u00b0C, at 188 rpm, for 16-18 h. Staphylococcus aureus Newman strain (NCTC 8178/ATCC) was cultured on Luria Bertani (LB) agar (Sigma Life Sciences, USA) and incubated for 48 h at 37 \u00b0C before being maintained at 4 \u00b0C. Overnight cultures were incubated aerobically in LB broth (Sigma Life Sciences, USA) in a shaking incubator set to 37 \u00b0C, at a speed of 188 rpm, for 16-18 h.</br>\n</p>\nBiofilm culture conditions: Overnight cultures of C. albicans and S. aureus were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min (Heraeus Megafuge 16R, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Germany) and washed twice using sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (Fisher Chemicals, Leicestershire, UK). C. albicans and S. aureus were standardised to 106 cells/ml in 50% foetal bovine serum (FBS). 50% FBS with no inoculum was used as a control. 1 ml of each of the individual cultures, mixed-cultures and controls were added to individual wells on a 24-well plate (Costar 3524 well plate, Corning Incorporated, NY, USA) containing a sterile cell culture Thermanox cover slip (13 mm \u00d8, Thermo Fisher Scientific, NY, USA). The cultures were incubated aerobically at 37 \u00b0C for 24 h. This experiment utilized six technical replicates for each condition.",

The reaction tubes were vortexed at maximum speed for 15 s (Vortex Genie 2, Scientific Industries, NY, USA) and stored at -80 \u00b0C prior to derivatization and analysis.</br>\n</p>\nIntracellular-metabolite extraction:</br>\nCell culture cover slips were removed from the wells and placed in bijouxs containing ice cold 10 mM ammonium bicarbonate. The bijouxs were sonicated at maximum speed for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C (XUB5, 4.5 L, Grant Instruments, Cambridgeshire, UK). The supernatants, including the debris, were removed and placed in clean reaction tubes. The biofilm suspensions were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min at 4 \u00b0C, the supernatants were removed, and 1 ml of a 1 ml:1 g extraction solvent (ChCl3:MeOH:H2O 1:3:1 v:v:v) : 0.1 mm acid washed glass beads (Sigma Aldrich, USA) were added to each pellet.

Samples were then dried in a Savant SPD1010 SpeedVac concentrator (Thermo Scientific) for 90 min. Inserts were then placed into a 9 mm screw cap amber borosilicate glass 1.5 ml vial (Thermo Scientific). Fifty \u00b5l of 20 mg / ml (w/v) methoxyamine HCl in pyridine was added to each dried sample and sealed. The vial and insert were vortexed for 10 s and incubated at 60 \u00b0C for 120 min. Following the methoximation step, 50 \u00b5l of MSTFA + 1% TMCS (N-Methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide + 1% trimethylchlorosilane) was added, followed by a further 10 s of vortexing. Silylation was performed by incubation at 80 \u00b0C for a further 120 min. Samples were cooled to room temperature. 1 \u00b5l of retention index alkane mixture was added to each sample.

The data from the samples were then screened against the compound databases and the integrated area for each detected compound recorded. Peak areas were then normalised using total detected signal to compensate for differences in sample loading. The normalised areas were then log2 transformed and compared.</br>\nPCAs were performed by importing the data into the Sieve 2.1 software\n",
