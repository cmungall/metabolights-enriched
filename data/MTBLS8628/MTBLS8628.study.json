It reveals that sn-isomer populations are tightly regulated and significantly different between cell lines and enables identification of rare lipids containing ultra long chain monounsaturated fatty acyl chains at the sn-1 position. It provides an order of magnitude increases over the number of sn-isomer pairs previously reported and is coupled with an automated data analysis pipeline.</p>",

MS1 spectra were collected for ca. 8 min with an m/z range of 350-1600 at a target mass resolution of 500,000 at m/z 200 (FWHM) and an automatic gain control (AGC) at 50% (manufacturer units) and a 50 ms maximum injection time.

MS2 spectra were acquired using a target mass resolution of 120,000 at m/z 200 with a maximum injection time of 246 ms and an AGC target of 300%.

Fragment assignments were produced by matching these files to the CIDOzID targetlist using the ALEX Xtractor with a target m/z tolerance of 0.003 Da and an estimated m/z offset of -0.0012 (based on inspection of typical mass offsets). The CIDOzID targetlist, fragment assignment results and a spreadsheet assigning sample group names and other metadata to each raw file is then imported by the \u2018Ozone-Enabled Identification\u2019 script written in SAS Enterprise Guide. The script first performs a file-by-file mass ppm error alignment at the MS3 level using median values of assigned fragments and filters all assignments by a +/-2.5 ppm cutoff.</p>",

For high-confidence identification of sn-position-defined molecular PC and PE species we devised a scoring algorithm that outputs a so-called CID/OzID fragment score. This scoring function is also implemented as an automatic and executable SAS Enterprise Guide script. This score function considers the number of expected fragment occurrences across all replicate analyses of a sample group. Lipids with different degrees of unsaturation and diacyl vs ether lipids, are assigned different expected numbers of fragments among the common 4 fragment subtypes, based on reliable patterns in fragment abundance observed from analysis of an array of standards. All lipids require observations of the {sn1a} fragment, detection of the CID/OzID-MS3 precursors (i.e. \u2018-PC(183)/-PE(141)\u2019 and the intermediate product ion&nbsp;\u2018-PC(183)+O/-PE(141)+O\u2019) in the same MS3 spectrum, as well as a CID/OzID fragment score of at least 0.8 to be considered \u2018high confidence\u2019.</p>",
