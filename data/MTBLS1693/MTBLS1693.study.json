                "description": "<p>The metabolome includes not just known but also unknown metabolites; however, metabolite annotation remains the bottleneck in untargeted metabolomics. Ion mobility \u2013 mass spectrometry (IM-MS) has emerged as a promising technology by providing multi-dimensional characterizations of metabolites. Here, we curated an ion mobility CCS atlas, namely AllCCS, and developed an integrated strategy for metabolite annotation using known or unknown chemical structures. The AllCCS atlas covers vast chemical structures with &gt;5000 experimental CCS records and ~12 million calculated CCS values for &gt;1.6 million small molecules. We demonstrated the high accuracy and wide applicability of AllCCS with medium relative errors of 0.5-2% for a broad spectrum of small molecules. AllCCS combined with in-silico MS/MS spectra facilitated multi-dimensional match and substantially improved the accuracy and coverage of both known and unknown metabolite annotation from biological samples. Together, AllCCS is a versatile resource that enables confident metabolite annotation, revealing comprehensive chemical and metabolic insights towards biological processes.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Known Metabolite Annotation in Different Biological Samples assays</strong> are reported in the current study <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS1693' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS1693</strong></a>.</p><p><strong>Unknown Metabolite Annotation in Mouse Aging assay</strong> is reported in <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS1622' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS1622</strong></a>.</p>",

A total of 100 \u03bcl of H2O and 800 \u03bcl of solvent mixture of ACN:MeOH (1:1, v/v) was added, and vortexed for 30 s, and sonicated for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C water bath. After incubation for 1 hour at \u221220 \u00b0C, the sample was further centrifuged for 15 min at 13,000 rpm and 4 \u00b0C. The supernatant was collected and evaporated to dryness at 4 \u00b0C. The dry extracts were then reconstituted into 100 \u03bcl of ACN:H2O (1:1, v/v), followed by sonication at 4 \u00b0C for 10 min, and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm and 4 \u00b0C for 5 min to remove the insoluble debris before LC-IM-MS/MS analysis.</p><p><br></p><p>For mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) cells, 1 ml of MeOH:ACN:H2O (2:2:1, v/v/v) solvent mixture was added to the samples, followed by vortex for 30 s and sonication for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C water bath.

Briefly, wild-type male fruit flies (FlyBase ID: <a href='https://flybase.org/reports/FBst0005905.html' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>FBst0005905</a>) were cultured in standard media (temperature, 25 \u00b0C; humidity, 60%; and a 12 h light and 12 h dark cycle). At day 3 (3-day) and day 30 (30-day), 100 fruit flies were collected and divided into 10 samples (10 flies in each sample, n = 10 in each group, and 20 samples in total). The fruit flies were killed with 75% ethanol. The heads of the fruit flies were collected and placed into microcentrifuge tubes. The tubes were immediately frozen with liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until metabolite extraction. The Drosophila aging samples were defrosted on ice. The Drosophila aging samples were then homogenized with 200 \u03bcl of H2O and 20 ceramic beads (diameter, 0.1 mm) using a homogenizer (Precellys 24, Bertin Technologies). A mixture of ACN:MeOH (1:1, v/v; 800 \u03bcl) was added to the samples, which were then vortexed for 30 s, followed by incubation in liquid nitrogen for 1 min, and then thawed on ice. This vortex\u2013freeze\u2013thaw cycle was repeated 3 times. The samples were incubated for 1 h at \u221220 \u00b0C for protein precipitation, followed by centrifugation at 16,200 x g and 4 \u00b0C for 15 min. The supernatant solution was removed and evaporated to dryness in a vacuum concentrator (Labconco, USA). A mixture of ACN:H2O (1:1, v/v; 100 \u00b5l) was then added to reconstitute the dry extracts, followed by sonication (50 Hz, 4 \u00b0C) for 10 min. The solutions were centrifuged at 16,200 x g and 4 \u00b0C for 5 min to precipitate the insoluble debris. Finally, the supernatant solutions were transferred to HPLC glass vials and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C prior to LC-IM-MS/MS analysis.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Shen X, Wang R, Xiong X, Yin Y, Cai Y, Ma Z, Liu N, Zhu ZJ.
