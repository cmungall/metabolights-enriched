                "description": "Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) is characterized by underdevelopment of left sided structures including the ventricle, valves, and aorta1. Although the mechanisms of disease pathogenesis remain elusive due to a paucity of candidate genes and animal models, prevailing paradigm suggests that HLHS is a multigenic disease of co-occurring phenotypes2,3. Here, we report that zebrafish lacking two orthologs of the RNA binding protein RBFOX2, a gene previously linked to HLHS in humans4,5, display cardiovascular defects overlapping those in HLHS patients. In contrast to current models, we demonstrate that co-existing ventricular, valve, and aortic deficiencies in rbfox mutant zebrafish arise secondary to impaired myocardial function as all three phenotypes are rescued when Rbfox is expressed specifically in the myocardium. On a molecular and cellular level, we find diminished expression and alternative splicing of sarcomere and mitochondrial components in rbfox-deficient hearts that compromise sarcomere assembly and mitochondrial respiration, respectively. Injection of human RBFOX2 mRNA restores ventricular structure and function in rbfox mutant zebrafish, while HLHS-linked RBFOX2 variants fail to rescue. Taken together, our data suggest that mutations in RBFOX2 are causal for HLHS pathogenesis and provide a complimentary paradigm for HLHS emergence where co-existing ventricular, valve, and aortic deficiencies have a monogenic etiology caused by myocardial dysfunction.",

The following zebrafish strains were used in this study: <strong>Tg(myl7:GFP)f1 1</strong>,<strong> Tg(myl7:nucGFP) fb18 2</strong>,<strong> Tg(kdrl:mCherry)s896 3</strong>, <strong>TgBAC(nkx2.5:Kaede)fb9 4</strong>,<strong> rbfox1lchb5 </strong>(this study),<strong> rbfox2chb6 </strong>(this study), <strong>Tg(myl7:GFP-P2A-rbfox1l)chb7 </strong>(this study).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Generation and Genotyping of rbfox1lchb5 and rbfox2chb6 mutant alleles</strong></p><p>Guide RNAs targeting the sequence 5\u2019- TGTGGCAGCGGCGGCTG -3\u2019 in exon 8 for rbfox1l and 5\u2019- GAGATCATCTTCAATGAAAG -3\u2019 in exon 3 for rbfox2 were generated and injected at a final concentration of 150 ng/\u00b5l with Cas9 protein (New England Biolabs) into one-cell stage <strong>zebrafish embryos </strong>as previously described<strong>[1]</strong>. Germline transmission of CRISPR/Cas9-induced deletions was detected using fluorescent PCR and DNA-fragment analysis as previously described<strong>[2]</strong>. For rbfox1l, 14 bp (CCGCAGCCGCCGCT) in exon 8 were deleted. For rbfox2, 2 bp (TCAATGAAAGGGGC) in exon 3 were deleted. For rbfox1l, the PCR primers: 5\u2019- GCAGTTTGTCGTTTTGCCCA-3\u2019 and 5\u2019- ACTGACCCTGGGTAGGCTG-3\u2019 were used for genotyping to produce a 193 bp wildtype amplicon and a 179 bp mutant (chb5) amplicon. For rbfox2, the PCR primers: 5\u2019-TTGGAAAGATTCTGGATGTG-3\u2019 and 5\u2019- TGACGAGTTTTGGAGGTTGA-3\u2019 were used to produce a 189 bp wildtype amplicon and a 187 bp mutant (chb6) amplicon. Construction of the Tg(myl7:GFP-rbfox1l) strain. A construct containing the following DNA elements was assembled by Gibson cloning: (1) a ~0.9 kb myl7 promoter to drive specific expression in cardiomyocytes; (2) a bicistronic cassette encoding an enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) and zebrafish Rbfox1l, separated by a viral P2A sequence and 3xHA tag. The entire construct was flanked with Tol2 sites to facilitate transgenesis. In this line, all <strong>cardiomyocytes </strong>constitutively express GFP and Rbfox1l. The full name of this line is <strong>Tg(myl7:GFP-P2A-3xHA-rbfox1l)chb7</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>For sample preparation, 50 <strong>embryos </strong>were dechorionated using pronase (0.5 mg/mL, Sigma) and transferred to a 1.5-mL tube. To dissolve the yolk, embryos were pipetted up and down with a P1000 in 1000 \u00b5L of cold Ringer\u2019s working solution with phosphatase inhibitor (Roche, 04906845001) and protease inhibitor (Roche, 11873580001) according to The Zebrafish Book<strong>[3]</strong>. Deyolked embryos were obtained by spinning at 4 \u00b0C for 2 min at 13,800 x g and removing the supernatant.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1] </strong>Jao LE, Wente SR, Chen W.

A total of 537 compounds were detected, of which 286 metabolites were detected in negative ion mode. This negative ion mode library was subsequently used for metabolite identification. Out of the 286 compounds, we narrowed the list down to the metabolites of interest: (S)-Lactate, Adenosine 5'-Diphosphate, Adenosine 5'-Monophosphate, Adenosine 5'-Triphosphate, Cytidine Triphosphate, Guanosine-diphosphate, Glutarate (internal standard), Cytidine monophosphate, Glutathione, Guanosine 5'-triphosphate, Inosine monophosphate, Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, Uridine-triphosphate. Sample QC/data processing were completed using the <strong>Thermo Tracefinder </strong>3.3 analysis software<strong> </strong>(Thermo Fisher Scientific) for peak detection and integration.&nbsp;QC is the SST, which stands for Systems Suitability Test. This consists of 11 metabolites that are run on a weekly basis, after negative and positive mode calibration is done, and before metabolomics samples are run. This is to ensure that the retention times (RT) are within a 5 ppm error window and there are no shifts in the RT. The SST consists of the following metabolites: Arginine, Nicotinamide, Uridine, L-Isoleucine, L-Valine, L-Alanine, L-Ornithine, L-Lysine, Citrate, IMP, Itaconate.</p>",
