                "description": "Peroxisomes are versatile single membrane-enclosed cytoplasmic organelles, involved in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid metabolism and diverse other metabolic processes. Peroxisomal disorders result from mutations in Pex genes-encoded proteins named peroxins (PEX proteins) and single peroxisomal enzyme deficiencies. The PEX11 protein family (\u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 isoforms) plays an important role in peroxisomal proliferation and fission. However, their specific functions and the metabolic impact caused by their deficiencies have not been precisely characterized. To understand the systemic molecular alterations caused by peroxisomal defects, here we utilized untreated peroxisomal biogenesis factor 11\u03b1 knockout (Pex11\u03b1 KO) mouse model and performed serial relative-quantitative lipidomic, metabolomic, and proteomic analyses of serum, liver, and heart tissue homogenates. We demonstrated significant specific changes in the abundances of multiple lipid species, polar metabolites, and proteins and dysregulated metabolic pathways in distinct biological specimens of the Pex11\u03b1 KO adult mice in comparison to the wild type (WT) controls. Overall, the present study reports comprehensive semi-quantitative molecular omics information of the Pex11\u03b1 KO mice, which might serve in the future as a reference for a better understanding of the roles of Pex11\u03b1 and underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of peroxisomal biogenesis disorders.",

The binary solvent system consisted of mobile phase A (H2O:ACN, 40:60 v/v with 10 mM ammonium formate and 0.1% formic acid) and mobile phase B (IPA:ACN, 90:10 with 10 mM ammonium formate and 0.1% formic acid). Lipids were eluted with a 28 min linear gradient of 30 to 100% mobile phase B (30% \u2013 43% over 2 min, 43% \u2013 55% from 2 \u2013 2.1 min, 55% \u2013 65% from 2.1 \u2013 12 min, 65% \u2013 85% from 12 \u2013 18 min, 85% \u2013 100% from 18 \u2013 20 min, maintained 100% B for 5 min, followed by an immediate drop back to 30%, which is held constant up to min 28 of each run). The column temperature was set to 50 \u00b0C and autosampler to 15 \u00b0C.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Polar Metabolites</strong></p><p>Dried polar metabolite extracts were reconstituted in 100 \u00b5l of 15% methanol and a 10 \u00b5l injection volume was used. Chromatographic separation was achieved using a reversed-phase ACQUITY UPLC HSS T3 1.8 \u00b5m column (100 X 2.1 mm, Waters) at a flow rate of 300 \u00b5l/min of a binary solvent system consisted of mobile phase A (100% water with 0.1% formic acid) and mobile phase B (100% acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid). Polar metabolites were eluted with a 20 min linear gradient of 1 to 99% mobile phase B (maintained 1% B for 1.5 min, then 1 \u2013 99% from 1 - 15 min, maintained 99% B for 2 min, followed by drop back to 1% in 0.3 min, which is held constant up to min 20 of each run). In the case of serum metabolite analysis, mobile phase B was replaced by 100% methanol with 0.1% formic acid and a linear gradient of 1 to 95% in 14 min (1% \u2013 15% over 1 min, 15% \u2013 35% from 1 \u2013 4 min, 35% \u2013 95% from 4 \u2013 7 min, maintained 95% B for 2 min, followed by drop back to 1% in 1 min, which is held constant up to min 14 of each run). The column and autosampler compartments were maintained at 40 \u00b0C and 4 \u00b0C, respectively.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Proteins</strong></p><p>Peptide digests (2.5 \u03bcg) were separated using a Dionex Ultimate 3000 UHPLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with Kinetex C18 reversed-phase 2.6 \u00b5m column (100 X 2.1 mm, 100 A\u00b0, Phenomenex). The sample was loaded onto the column with 97% of mobile phase A (100% water, 0.1% formic acid) and 3% of mobile phase B (100% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid) at 250 \u03bcl/min flow rate. Peptides were eluted with a 120 min linear gradient of 3 to 50% mobile phase B (maintained 3% for 5 min, then 3% \u2013 40% from 5 \u2013 95 min, 40% \u2013 50% from 95 \u2013 105 min, 50% \u2013 98% from 105 \u2013 108 min, maintained 98% B for 2 min, followed by drop back to 3% in 2 min, which is held constant up to min 120 of each run). The column temperature was set to 40 \u00b0C and autosampler at 4 \u00b0C.</p>",

The following parameters were used for search: Database \u2013 General and HCD; Search Type - Product; Experiment Type - LC-MS; Parent Tolerance - 0.1 Da; NL/Prec Tol - 0.5 Da; Precursor Tolerance - 5.0 ppm; Product Tolerance \u2013 5.0 ppm; Merge Range (Min) - 0.0; Minimal Peak Width (min) - 0.0; Threshold Type - Relative; Product Ion - 1.0%; m-score threshold - 2.0; Recalculate Isotope - ON; R.T. Interval (min) - 0.0; Execute Quantitation - ON; <em>m/z</em> Tolerance - \u22125.0/+5.0; Tolerance Type - ppm; R.T. range (min) - \u22120.5/+0.5; Top rank filter - ON; Main Node Filter - Main Isomer Peak; m-Score Threshold (Display) - 5.0; C-Score Threshold (Display) - 2.0; Fatty Acid Priority (FA Priority) - ON; ID Quality Filter (A, B, C, D). Adducts of +H, +NH4, +Na, +K, +H-H20, +H-2H20, +2H and \u2013H, +HCOO, -2H were applied for positive- and negative-ion modes respectively. The following parameters were used for alignment: Search Type - Product; Experiment Type \u2013 LC-MS; Alignment Method - Mean; R.T. Tolerance - 0.25; Calculate Unassigned Peak Area - ON; Filter Type - New Filter; Top rank Filter -ON; Main Node Filter \u2013 All isomer peaks; m-score threshold - 5.0; ID Quality - A, B, C, D. All lipid species aligned using the <strong>LipidSearch </strong>software were filtered with predefined filtering criteria to remove false positives, and manually curated after computational analysis, being either accepted, rejected, or reassigned.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Polar Metabolites</strong></p><p>Metabolomic datasets of both positive- and negative-ion modes were processed independently using the<strong> Progenesis QI</strong> (version 2.4) data analysis software (Nonlinear Dynamics, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK). The detailed workflow for data processing and analysis included data import, retention time (RT) alignment, experimental design setup, peak picking, deconvolution, identification of compounds, normalization and relative quantification<strong>[2]</strong>. The adduct ions of each feature (<em>m/z</em>, RT) were deconvoluted and identified primarily using an in-house developed metabolite database, <strong>EMBL-MCF</strong> (<a href='http://curatr.mcf.embl.de' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>http://curatr.mcf.embl.de</a>), <strong>MassBank of North America</strong> (<a href='https://mona.fiehnlab.ucdavis.edu/' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>https://mona.fiehnlab.ucdavis.edu/</a>), <strong>m/z cloud </strong>(<a href='https://www.mzcloud.org/' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>https://www.mzcloud.org/</a>) mass spectral libraries using precursor ion accurate mass (MS) and fragmentation (MS/MS) patterns.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Proteins</strong></p><p>Proteomic datasets were processed using untargeted label-free processing and consensus workflows of<strong> Proteome Discoverer</strong> (version <strong>2.2.0.388</strong>) software (Thermo Fisher Scientific). MS data files were searched against <strong>UniProt </strong>Mus musculus protein database (downloaded on 15th September 2019, containing 17422 target sequences and 9908993 residues) using Sequest HT search algorithm. The search was performed with peptide precursor and fragment mass tolerance of 10 ppm, 0.02 Da respectively and trypsin as a protease with two missed cleavages and 1% false discovery rate (FDR). Search criteria also included carbamidomethylation of cysteine (57.021 Da) as fixed modification, N-terminal acetylation (42.011 Da) and methionine oxidation (15.995 Da) as variable modifications. Unique and razor peptides were considered, precursor abundance values were normalized with total peptide amount and replicate-based resampling imputed missing values. Abundance ratios (KO/WT) were calculated using the pairwise ratio method and significant values were obtained from ANOVA hypothesis test (based on the background population of proteins or peptides). The common external protein contaminant list (<strong>MaxQuant database</strong>) was used to mark contaminants in the result file.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Li Z, Lai ZW, Christiano R, Gazos-Lopes F, Walther TC, Farese RV Jr. Global Analyses of Selective Insulin Resistance in Hepatocytes Caused by Palmitate Lipotoxicity.
