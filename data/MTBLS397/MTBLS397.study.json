                "description": "Lipid Data Analyzer (LDA; http://genome.tugraz.at/lda2) provides automated and reliable annotation of lipid species and their molecular structures in high-throughput data from chromatography-coupled tandem mass spectrometry using embedded rule sets. Using various low- and high-resolution mass spectrometry instruments with several collision energies, the method's platform independence is proved. The software's reliability, flexibility, and ability to identify novel lipid molecular species may now render current state-of-the-art lipid libraries obsolete. </br></br> In a benchmark test of LDA versus LipidBlast, data from both the first control experiment and the biological experiment, both acquired on the Orbitrap Velos Pro in CID +50 and -50, was used. In addition, the biological experiment was benchmarked for the lower resolution QTRAP 4000 for +45 eV and -45 eV. For LipidBlast evaluation, the parameters recommended by NIST MSPepSearchGUI (http://peptide.nist.gov/software/ms_pep_search_gui/MSPepSearch.html) were used. The same m/z tolerances were applied in both LipidBlast and LDA. The specificity and sensitivity of LipidBlast depend on a so called matching factor, a value ranging from 0-999. Using the default setting of 450 for the matching factor, many lipid standards in Control experiment 1 were not detected. Consequently, the matching factor was lowered to 10, in which case LipidBlast detected almost all of the lipid standards in negative ion mode. Further reduction did not improve the sensitivity of LipidBlast. In positive ion mode, irrespective of the matching factor setting, LipidBlast was not able to identify as many lipid molecular species as was LDA. In this benchmark test, only lipid subclasses/adducts that both LDA and LipidBlast are able to detect were used. Correct assignment of lipid species and lipid molecular species identified in liver lipidomes was verified by manual inspection of the spectra, and by aligning them with the respective retention time data.</br></br>Control experiment 1 assays for this study can be found in the MetaboLights study MTBLS394.</br> Control experiment 2 assays for this study can be found in the MetaboLights study MTBLS391.</br> Control experiment 3 assays for this study can be found in the MetaboLights study MTBLS398.</br> Murine liver lipidome experiment assays for this study can be found in the MetaboLights study MTBLS396.</br> HCD characterization and regioisomer detection assays for this study can be found in the MetaboLights study MTBLS462.</br> <br/>Linked Studies: <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS391' target='_blank'><span class='label label-success'>MTBLS391</span></a> <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS394' target='_blank'><span class='label label-success'>MTBLS394</span></a> <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS396' target='_blank'><span class='label label-success'>MTBLS396</span></a> <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS398' target='_blank'><span class='label label-success'>MTBLS398</span></a> <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS462' target='_blank'><span class='label label-success'>MTBLS462</span></a>",

Prior to experiments, lens settings and source parameters were optimized to the signal of PE 34:1 (using protonated/deprotonated molecular ion in positive/negative ion mode, respectively) infused into the column effluent of 80% mobile phase B with a mixing tee. Ion source parameters for positive polarity were as follows: Source Voltage 4.5 kV; source temperature 375 \u00b0C; sheath gas 25 arbitrary units (AU); aux gas 9 AU; sweep gas 0 AU; capillary temperature 300 \u00b0C. Ion source parameters for negative ion mode were: Source voltage 3.8 kV; source temperature 325 \u00b0C; sheath gas 30 AU; aux gas 10 AU; sweep gas 0 AU; capillary temperature 300 \u00b0C. Full scan spectra from m/z 400 to 1,000 for positive ion mode and from m/z 400 to 1,000 in negative ion mode were acquired at a target resolution of 100,000 (FWHM at m/z 400). From each full scan spectrum, ions were selected for sequential fragmentation in the linear ion trap (collision-induced dissociation (CID) experiments) and detected in the ion trap analyzer. The 10 most abundant ions of the full scan spectrum were fragmented using He as collision gas (isolation width 1.5 m/z; activation Q 0.2; activation time 10 ms). Normalized collision energy was 50 in both positive and negative ion mode.\n</p>\nQTRAP 4000:</br>\nThe QTRAP 4000 (AB Sciex, Concord, Canada) was controlled by Analyst v. 1.6.1 software and operated in Information Dependent Acquisition (IDA) mode, using an enhanced MS (EMS) scan from m/z 400 to 1,050 and 400 to 1,000 in positive and negative ion mode, respectively, at 1,000 Da/s as a survey scan. Prior to analysis, source parameters were optimized using flow injection analysis into an isocratic flow of 80% mobile phase B. Analytes were PC 36:1 (m/z 788.6-184) for positive ion mode and PE 36:2 (m/z 742-279) for negative ion mode. The optimized source parameters of the Turbo V ion source for positive ion mode were as follows: Curtain gas 15 AU; collision gas high; ionspray voltage 5,000 V; temperature 450 \u00b0C; gas 1 50 AU; gas 2 50 AU; declustering potential 60 V; collision energy spread 0; collision energy 45 V. Source parameters for negative ion mode were: Curtain gas 10 AU; collision gas high; ionspray voltage 4,500 V; temperature 600 \u00b0C; gas 1 20 AU; gas 2 50 AU; declustering potential 95 V; collision energy spread 0; collision energy 45 V. Isolation width was unit resolution, which corresponds to 0.6-0.8 Da. From each survey scan, the four most abundant ions exceeding 1,000 counts were chosen for enhanced product ion (EPI) scans at 4,000 Da/s. Previously detected target ions were excluded for 10 s.",
