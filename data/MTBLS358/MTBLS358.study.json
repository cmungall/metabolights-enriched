                "description": "The overall clinical study used a parallel-group, case-controlled study design in order to identify a biomarker or panel of biomarkers for the differentiation of subjects with mild to moderate COPD (GOLD stage I and II), asymptomatic current smokers, former smokers and never-smokers and to compare physiological measurements and quality of life (QoL) across the study groups. The study was conducted between July 2011 and December 2012, at a single clinical site in London, UK, after approval from a UK National Health Service (NHS) ethics committee (The Black County Ethics Committee) and in strict compliance with International Conference on Harmonisation-Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP) guidelines. The study has been registered on ClinicalTrials.gov with identifier NCT01780298. Male and female subjects aged between 41 and 70 years were enrolled with a completed total subject number of 60 per group. During the course of the study, sputum, blood, and nasal samples were collected and a number of physiological and clinical measurements were recorded from a total of 240 subjects. Each subject in each of the 3 control groups, namely the healthy smokers, never-smokers and ex-smokers, were matched to subjects in the COPD group by age (+/-5 years), ethnicity, gender, and all smoking subjects had a smoking history of at least 10 pack-years. The study subject were required to attend the study visits after having eaten a light breakfast. Analyses of lipid species were performed in serum samples from a subset of study subjects including 40 never-smokers, 40 former smokers, 40 smokers, and 40 COPD patients by Zora Biosciences Oy (Espoo, Finland). The data from this analysis are reported here.",

A modified Folch protocol, using chloroform, methanol and acetic acid for liquid-liquid extraction was applied to extract a broad lipid type spectrum. This extraction procedure is efficient and robust over a wide lipid concentration range. This method was used to extract glycerolipids, glycerophospholipids, sterol esters and sphingolipids. Eicosanoids were extracted according to the procedure by Deems. Prior to extraction, the samples were spiked with known amounts of internal standards (IS). This set of ISs were used to quantify the endogenous lipids in samples and controls as described. Following lipid extraction, samples were dried under a gentle stream of nitrogen. Samples for shotgun lipidomics were reconstituted in chloroform:methanol (1:2, v/v), samples for eicosanoids were reconstituted in methanol. The final extracts were stored at -20 \u00b0C upon mass spectrometry analysis.\n",

Aliquots of 10 \u00b5L were aspirated and infused. Precursor ion and neutral loss scans were carried out in positive and negative ion modes. On the TriVersa NanoMate electrospray ionization (ESI) voltages applied were typically 1.3 and -1.3 kV in positive and negative ion modes respectively.

Shotgun lipidomics data was processed in LipidView as described previously. Briefly, the endogenous species were identified based on their characteristic fragment ions, neutral losses and parent ions. For instance, m/z 184.1 which is the characteristic headgroup ion of phosphatidylcholines (PC) and sphingomyeline was used to identify together with the parent mass the peaks observed in the mass spectrum of PIS 184.1 in positive ion mode. In a similar way the monitored acyl ions were utilized to identify the molecular species in negative ion mode. For instance, identification of PC 16:0-18:1 requires corresponding signals from both the 16:0 (PIS of m/z 255.2) and the 18:1 (PIS of m/z 281.2) scans. MRM data was processed in MultiQuant. The selected lipid characteristic ions and their parent masses in conjunction with retention time were used for the identification of the endogenous species. The identified lipids were quantified by normalizing against their respective internal standard and matrix type, and presented accordingly in \u00b5M. For identification of differentially abundant lipids, outlier samples with a total summed lipid concentration below (above) the first (third) quartil (+) 1.5x times the interquartile range were excluded. For the identification of differentially abundant lipids between the groups, only lipid species that were present/quantified in at least 50% of the samples of each group were included. The data was log-transformed and linear models were fitted for the following group contrasts: CS vs. NS, CS vs. FS, FS vs. NS, COPD vs. NS, COPD vs. FS, and COPD vs. CS. In the final models, gender, age, and BMI were included as covariates. P-values from a moderated t-statistic were calculated with the empirical Bayes approach and the Benjamini Hochberg FDR method wass used to correct for multiple testing effects.</p>",
