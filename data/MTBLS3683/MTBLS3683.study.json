                "description": "<p>Antibiotics were once used in animal production to improve productivity and resistance to pathogenic microbiota. However, due to its negative effects, the search for a new class of substances that can replace its efficacy has become one of the urgent problems to be solved. Plant essential oils (EOs) as a natural feed additive can maintain microbiota homeostasis and improve animal performance. However, its specific mechanism of action needs to be further investigated. Therefore, we added different doses of essential oil of Zanthoxylum bungeanum (EOZB) to the diets of Small Tail Han Sheep hybrid male lambs (STH lambs) to evaluate the effect of EOZB on rumen enzyme activity, rumen microbiology and its metabolites in STH lambs. Twenty STH lambs were randomly divided into four groups (n = 5/group) and provided with the same diet. The dietary treatments were as follows: basal diet (BD) group; BD+EOZB 5 mL/kg group; BD+EOZB 10 mL/kg group; BD+EOZB 15 mL/kg group. We found that EOZB 10 ml/kg helped to increase rumen pectinase (P&lt;0.05) and lipase (P&lt;0.05) activities. Microbial 16S rRNA gene analysis showed that EOZB significantly altered the abundance of rumen microbiota (P&lt;0.05). LC/GC-MS metabolomic analysis showed that the addition of EOZB produced a total of 1073 differential metabolites, with 58 differential metabolites remaining after raising the screening criteria. These differential metabolites were mainly enriched in glycerophospholipid metabolism, choline metabolism in cancer, retrograde endocannabinoid signaling, benzoxazinoid biosynthesis, and protein digestion and absorption. Correlation analysis showed that some rumen microbiota were significantly correlated with differential metabolite and enzyme activities.</p>",

According to different trial groups, different doses of essential oil of <em>Zanthoxylum bungeanum</em> (EOZB) were administered daily. The experiment was performed for a total of 52 days, the lambs in each group were stunned (head electric shock) and then sacrificed (performed by professional butchers) by exsanguination of the jugular vein after the end of the trial. Rumen content (solid-liquid mixing) was collected into 1.5 mL sterile polypropylene tubes, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen at -80 \u00b0C, and stored for further analysis of the microbiome and metabolome. At the same time, rumen content was collected in sterilized cryotubes and stored at -20 \u00b0C for the determination of rumen digestive enzyme activity.</p>",
