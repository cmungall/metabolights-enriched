                "description": "<p>The history of lichen compound identification has long relied on techniques such as spot tests and TLC, which have been surpassed in sensitivity and accuracy by modern metabolomic techniques such as high-resolution MS/MS. In 2019, Olivier-Jimenez et al. released the Lichen DataBase (LDB), a library containing the Q-TOF MS/MS spectra of 251 metabolites on the GNPS and MetaboLights platforms, that has been widely used for the identification of lichen-derived unknowns. To increase the compound coverage, we have generated the Orbitrap MS/MS spectra of a further 534 lichen-derived compounds from the metabolite library of Jack Elix, housed at the CANB herbarium (Canberra, Australia). This included 399 unique metabolites that are not in the LDB, bringing the total number combined to 650. Technical validation was achieved by investigating the compounds in three Australian lichen extracts using the Library Search and Molecular Networking tools on the GNPS platform. This update provides a much larger database for lichen compound identification, which we envisage will allow refining of the chemotaxonomy framework and contribute to compound discovery.</p>",

Subsamples of each pure compound were taken with clean metal spatulas, transferred to Eppendorf tubes and weighed with an ABT-22-4M (Kern) precision balance for a target amount of 0.1-1 mg. For compounds with little material available, 50 \u00b5L of LCMS-grade MeOH were added to the glass container and 25 \u00b5l were pipetted back into an Eppendorf tube after mixing. Both the glass container and the Eppendorf tubes were then let to evaporate in a fume hood to dry the samples. All samples reconstituted to 1 mg/mL in LCMS-grade MeOH. They were then sonicated, centrifuged and the supernatant was transferred to 1.5 mL LCMS vials for analysis.</p>",
