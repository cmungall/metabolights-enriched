                "description": "<p>We used time-resolved metabolic footprinting, an important technical approach used to monitor changes in extracellular compound concentrations during microbial growth, to study the order of substrate utilization (i.e., substrate preferences) and kinetics of a fast-growing soil isolate, <em>Paraburkholderia</em> sp. strain 1N. The growth of <em>Paraburkholderia</em> sp. 1N was monitored under aerobic conditions in a soil-extracted solubilized organic matter medium, representing a realistic diversity of available substrates and gradient of initial concentrations. We combined multiple analytical approaches to track over 150 compounds in the medium and complemented this with bulk carbon and nitrogen measurements, allowing estimates of carbon use efficiency throughout the growth curve. Targeted methods allowed the quantification of common low-molecular-weight substrates: glucose, 20 amino acids, and 9 organic acids. All targeted compounds were depleted from the medium, and depletion followed a sigmoidal curve where sufficient data were available. Substrates were utilized in at least three distinct temporal clusters as <em>Paraburkholderia</em> sp. 1N produced biomass at a cumulative carbon use efficiency of 0.43. The two substrates with highest initial concentrations, glucose and valine, exhibited longer usage windows, at higher biomass-normalized rates, and later in the growth curve. Contrary to hypotheses based on previous studies, we found no clear relationship between substrate nominal oxidation state of carbon (NOSC) or maximal growth rate and the order of substrate depletion. Under soil solution conditions, the growth of <em>Paraburkholderia</em> sp. 1N induced multiauxic substrate depletion patterns that could not be explained by the traditional paradigm of catabolite repression.</p><p><strong>IMPORTANCE:</strong> Exometabolomic footprinting methods have the capability to provide time-resolved observations of the uptake and release of hundreds of compounds during microbial growth. Of particular interest is microbial phenotyping under environmentally relevant soil conditions, consisting of relatively low concentrations and modeling pulse input events. Here, we show that growth of a bacterial soil isolate, <em>Paraburkholderia</em> sp. 1N, on a dilute soil extract resulted in a multiauxic metabolic response, characterized by discrete temporal clusters of substrate depletion and metabolite production. Our data did not support the hypothesis that compounds with lower energy content are used preferentially, as each cluster contained compounds with a range of nominal oxidation states of carbon. These new findings with <em>Paraburkholderia</em> sp. 1N, which belongs to a metabolically diverse genus, provide insights on ecological strategies employed by aerobic heterotrophs competing for low-molecular-weight substrates in soil solution.</p>",

Field-moist soil samples were immediately placed in a cooler and stored at 4\u00b0C until further processing (&lt; 24 hours).&nbsp;SESOM was prepared using a modified water extraction procedure. Briefly, 40 g of air dried Oa horizon from Arnot Forest was mixed with 200 mL of 18.2 M\u03a9-cm water in 250 mL Nalgene bottles and shaken on an end-to-end shaker for 1 hr at room temperature. Bottles were then left to stand for 24 hr and then sequentially filtered through 1.6 \u03bcm GF/A, 0.45 \u03bcm PES, and then 0.2 \u03bcm PES filters to produce a filter-sterilized solution. Multiple bottles were extracted at once and combined to provide sufficient SESOM for experimental purposes. The extracted solution was diluted 2-fold for all growth experiments to produce concentrations that might be more realistically encountered in percolating pore water following a rainfall event.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Growth on SESOM</strong>.&nbsp;Acid-washed and autoclaved 125 mL Erlenmeyer flasks were used for all growth curve experiments. A starter flask containing 50 mL of SESOM was inoculated with a single colony of&nbsp;Paraburholderia&nbsp;sp. 1N.&nbsp;and grown overnight on a shaker at 150 RPM until reaching log phase. A 0.5 mL subsample (OD600 nm&nbsp;= 0.0658 or ~7.64 mg/L biomass) was used to inoculate each experimental flask for the growth curve assessment (starting biomass = 0.0757 mg/L). Assessment of the growth curve was conducted using optical density (OD600 nm). A growth curve was then fit using a 4-point sigmoidal function. Other measurements of the same isolate growing in SESOM from the starter flask, a secondary, unharvested treatment flask, and another experimental trial all further confirmed model fit parameters.</p><p><br></p><p>To allow the tracking of substrate depletion during growth, three flasks were destructively harvested at four points along the growth curve (17, 19, 22, 24 hr). Points were chosen to cover the breadth of the exponential phase of growth and the beginning of stationary phase. While each flask was independent, they were treated as replicates for each time point in subsequent analyses. During each destructive sampling event, 10 mL was removed for analyses on unfiltered components (TOC, TN, cellular protein content) while the remaining 40 mL was filtered through 0.2 \u00b5m PES filters to remove cellular biomass and stored frozen in separate aliquots for further analyses (pH, TOC, TN, reducing sugars, NO3-, NO2-, NH4-, ninhydrin-N,&nbsp;1H NMR,&nbsp;LC-HRMS). Since all media was from a single extraction event and of limited volume, all initial media values were analyzed only once for each analyte of interest. A Shimadzu TOC-VCPN&nbsp;was used to measure non-purgeable organic carbon (referred to as total organic carbon \u2013 TOC) and total nitrogen (TN) using a 2% acidification (0.2 M HCl) and 1:30 min sparge time using high temperature (720 \u00b0C) catalytic (Pt) oxidation. Cellular protein content was measured on dual analytical replicates using a modified Bradford protein assay using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the standard. Reducing sugars were measured using a colorimetric alkaline ferricyanide reaction. The colorimetric Griess reaction method was used to measure NO3-&nbsp;and NO2-. A modified Berthelot reaction was used to measure NH4+. Total free amino acids were estimated using a ninhydrin method (referred to as ninhydrin-N). All colorimetric samples were analyzed using a Shimadzu UV-2600 UV-Vis Spectrophotometer.&nbsp;</p>",

The template was built using standards of all compounds identified run between 0 \u2013 15 \u00b5M for quantification.&nbsp;Blanks were created using the appropriate solvent (LC-MS grade H2O or 50% v/v acetonitrile). Standards contained all metabolites from the associated method references at the nominal concentration value but only those listed in the linked MAF sheet as MSI:1 were used for quantification. A new standard curve containing cysteine and valine was necessary to produce a more suitable calibration curve for the HILIC method and those standards are separately labeled with 'cys_val'. Quality control (QC) checks were run every 10 samples with a 30% SD limit. If outside of limit, sample were re-run. </p><p><br></p><p>Data from the reverse phase method were alternatively processed using an untargeted approach via XCMS online v.2.3.0. XCMS settings for processing LC/MS data with findPeaks.centWave() were ppm=15; snthr=4; peakwidth=(20,60); mzdiff =(0.01); prefilter peaks =(3); prefilter intensity=(100). For retention time correction, the obiwarp method was used with profStep=0.5. For alignment, group.density() function was used with parameters bw =(5); mzwid=(0.025); minfrac=(0.5); minsamp=(1). XCMS online output with CAMERA annotation was then imported and further processed using&nbsp;R 3.6.0. Features of interest were further refined based on the following selection criteria (|ln(fold-change)|&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt; 1, p &lt; 0.05, maxint &gt; 107). Metabolites already targeted were removed based on overlapping m/z (+/- 0.001) and retention time (+/- 30 s). All reported values are integrated areas under the curve.</p><p><br></p><p>NMR spectra were analyzed within MestReNova (v.12.0.0-20080), spectra were Fourier transformed and zero-filled to 64 k data points. Spectra were then linearly phase shifted and apodized using a 0 Hz exponential function. All spectra were manually phase corrected (PH0: -26, PH1:6), and baseline corrected using the built in polynomial fit function. All spectra were reference shifted so TMSP = 0.00 ppm. Lastly, residual water peak was removed using the signal suppression tool with selectivity at 24 centered on the 4.7 ppm signal. Compound identification was initiated by matching peaks of interest with suitable references&nbsp;as well as using online spectral databanks (Human Metabolome Database) to confirm multiplicity and chemical shift. Once identified, integrating regions were defined and used for integration on all samples. One feature was not identified and presented data is normalized to the highest spectral integration value.</p>",
