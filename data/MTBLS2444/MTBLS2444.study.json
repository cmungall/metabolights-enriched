                "description": "Vesicular traffic and membrane contact sites between organelles enable the exchange of proteins, lipids, and metabolites. Recruitment of membrane tethers to contact sites between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the plasma membrane is often triggered by calcium. In contrast, we reveal here a function for calcium in the repression of cholesterol export at membrane contact sites between the ER and the Golgi complex. We show that calcium efflux from ER stores induced by inositol-triphosphate [IP3] accumulation upon loss of the inositol 5-phosphatase INPP5A or sustained receptor signaling triggers the depletion of cholesterol and associated complex glycosphingolipids from the cell surface, resulting in a blockade of clathrin-independent endocytosis (CIE) of bacterial Shiga toxin. This phenotype is caused by the calcium-induced dissociation of oxysterol binding protein (OSBP) from the Golgi complex and from VAP-containing membrane contact sites. Our findings reveal a crucial function for INPP5A-mediated IP3 hydrolysis in the control of lipid exchange at membrane contact sites.",

VAP-A/B double knock-out<strong>[1]</strong> and parental HeLa cells were a gift from Prof Pietro De Camilli\u2019s laboratory (Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA). Cells were cultured in DMEM with 4.5 g/l glucose (Lonza) containing 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Gibco) and 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin (Gibco) during experimental procedures. Human INPP5A 4 bp deletion KO cell line and a C631 human HAP1 parental control cell line was purchased from Horizon Discovery (HZGHC006619c008). Cells were routinely tested for Mycoplasma contamination and all tests were negative.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>siRNA and cDNA transfections:</strong></p><p>1 x 10^5 (Hela, HeLaM, COS-7) cells or 3 x 10^5 HEK293T cells, with low passage numbers, are reverse-transfected using jetPRIME transfection reagent according to the manufacturer protocol using 100 nM of each siRNA. If DNA cotransfection is needed, cells are first reverse-transfected with siRNA, and 24 h later, 2 \u03bcg of DNA is transfected using the jetPRIME protocol.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Isolation of plasma membrane-enriched fractions from HeLa cells:</strong></p><p>To isolate the plasma membrane, the Minute Plasma Membrane Protein Isolation and Cell Fractionation Kit (SM-005) from (Invent Biotechnologies) was used. For each condition, 3 biological samples were prepared: 1 technical replicate was prepared for subsequent western blot analysis. To separate the membrane HeLa cells, 5 x 10^6 cells were used per sample. Cells were harvested by spinning them down at 300 x g for 5 min. Then, the cells were resuspended in ice cold PBS and centrifuged at 1700 x g and 4 \u00b0C for 1 min to remove residual culture medium. After PBS was removed completely, the cells were sensitized for lysis in 500 \u03bcl Buffer A supplemented with 1x Roche complete protease inhibitor cocktail (PIC). Suspension was mixed on the Vortex shaker for 20 s and incubated for 10 min on ice. Then, the suspension was transferred to the filter cartridges and centrifuged for 30 s at 16,000 x g and 4 \u00b0C. To increase the yield, the resulting pellet was resuspended in the flow through and passed through the filter a second time with the same conditions. For separation of nuclei from membrane and cytosolic fractions, the ruptured cells were centrifuged at 700 x g and 4 \u00b0C for 1 min. The supernatant was transferred to a new reaction tube and centrifuged for 30 min at 16,000 x g, 4 \u00b0C. the resulted supernatant contained the cytosolic proteins, while the total membrane proteins were collected in the pellet. The total membrane protein pellet was resuspended in 200 \u03bcl Buffer B by pipetting and shaking with the Vortex mixer. To separate organelle membrane proteins from plasma membrane proteins, samples were centrifuged at 7800 x g and 4 \u00b0C for 20 min. The pellet containing organelle membrane proteins was stored undissolved at \u221220 \u00b0C until further use. Supernatant was transferred to a new 2.0 ml reaction tube and combined with 1.6 ml cold PBS by inversion. Centrifugation was conducted at 16,000 x g for 30 min and the pellet containing the plasma membrane proteins was stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until lipidomics analysis.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Dong R, Saheki Y, Swarup S, Lucast L, Harper JW, De Camilli P.

                        "description": "<p>Cells were subjected to lipid extractions using an acidic liquid-liquid extraction method<strong>[1]</strong>, except for plasmalogens, which were extracted under neutral conditions.</p><p><br></p><p>To ensure that similar amounts of lipids were subjected to extractions, a test extraction was performed to determine the concentration of PC as a bulk membrane lipid and to adapt extractions volumes to similar total lipid amounts. Typically, a total lipid amount of approximately 2600 pmol (cells) or 2900 pmol (subcellular fractions) was subjected to extractions. Quantification was achieved by adding 1\u20133 internal lipid standards for each lipid class, with the standards resembling the structure of the endogenous lipid species. Of note, sample volumes were adjusted to ensure that all lipid standard to lipid species ratios were in a linear range of quantification. Typically, the range of standard to species ratios were within a range of &gt;0.1 to &lt;10. Following this approach, a relative quantification of lipid species was performed. Lipid standards were added prior to extractions, using a master mix consisting of 50 pmol phosphatidylcholine (PC, 13:0/13:0, 14:0/14:0, 20:0/20:0; 21:0/21:0, Avanti Polar Lipids), 50 pmol sphingomyelin (SM, d18:1 with N-acylated 13:0, 17:0, 25:0, semi-synthesized<strong>[2]</strong>, 100 pmol deuterated cholesterol (D6-cholesterol or D7-cholesterol, Cambridge Isotope Laboratory), 30 pmol phosphatidylinositol (PI, 17:0/20:4, Avanti Polar Lipids), 25 pmol phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and 25 pmol phosphatidylserine (PS) (both 14:1/ 14:1, 20:1/20:1, 22:1/22:1, semi-synthesized<strong>[2]</strong>), 25 pmol diacylglycerol (DAG, 17:0/ 17:0, Larodan), 25 pmol cholesteryl ester (CE, 9:0, 19:0, 24:1, Sigma), and 24 pmol triacylglycerol (TAG, LM-6000/D5-17:0,17:1,17:1, Avanti Polar Lipids), 5 pmol ceramide (Cer, d18:1 with N-acylated 14:0, 17:0, 25:0, semi-synthesized<strong>[2]</strong> or Cer d18:1/18:0-D3, Matreya) and 5 pmol glucosylceramide (HexCer) (d18:1 with N- acylated 14:0, 19:0, 27:0, semi-synthesized or GlcCer d18:1/17:0, Avanti Polar Lipids), 5 pmol lactosylceramide (Hex2Cer, d18:1 with N-acylated C17 fatty acid), 10 pmol phosphatidic acid (PA, 17:0/20:4, Avanti Polar Lipids), 10 pmol phosphatidylglycerol (PG, 14:1/14:1, 20:1/20:1, 22:1/22:1, semi-synthesized<strong>[2]</strong>) and 5 pmol lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC, 17:1, Avanti Polar Lipids). The phosphatidylethanolamine plasmalogen (pl-PE-) standard mix consisted of 16.5 pmol PE P-Mix 1 (16:0p/15:0, 16:0p/19:0, 16:0p/ 25:0), 23.25 pmol PE P-Mix 2 (18:0p/15:0, 18:0p/19:0, 18:0p/25:0), 32.25 pmol PE P-Mix 3 (18:1p/15:0, 18:1p/ 19:0, 18:1p/25:0). Semi-synthesis of PE P- was performed as reviously described<strong>[3]</strong>. The final CHCl3 phase was evaporated under a gentle stream of nitrogen at 37 \u00b0C. Samples were either directly subjected to mass spectrometric analysis, or were stored at \u221220 \u00b0C prior to analysis, which was typically done within 1-2 days after extraction.</p><p><br></p><p>Lipid extracts were resuspended in 10 mM ammonium acetate in 60 \u03bcl methanol. 2-\u03bcl aliquots of the resuspended lipid extracts were diluted 1:10 in 10 mM ammonium acetate in methanol in 96-well plates (Eppendorf twin tec 96) prior to measurement.</p><p><br></p><p>For cholesterol determinations, the remaining lipid extract was again evaporated and subjected to acetylation as previously described<strong>[4]</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p>The amount for endogenous molecular lipid species was calculated based on the intensities of the internal standards. For the quantification of GM1, GM2, GM3, and GB3, extractions were performed by a 2-step procedure as previously described<strong>[5]</strong>. Briefly, sample amounts of approx. 15-20 nM of total lipid were subjected to the glycosphingolipid analysis. The sample volumes were adjusted to 200 \u03bcl using 155 mM ammonium bicarbonate in methanol. The first neutral extraction was performed using chloroform:methanol (17:1, vol:vol), followed by a chloroform:methanol (2:1, vol:vol) extraction. The following internal standards (Matreya LLC) were used: 25 pmol GB3 (d18:1/18:0-D3), 25 pmol GM3 (d18:1/18:0-D3), 25 pmol GM2 (d18:1/18:0-D3), and 25 pmol GM1 (d18:1/18:0-D3) semi-synthesized in-house, following a protocol previously described<strong>[6]</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p>For cells, residual amounts of GM1 were recovered from the aqueous phase of the 2-step extraction by a C8 functionalized solid-phase extraction<strong>[7]</strong>. C8-cartdriges were equilibrated in methanol and conditioned with 60% methanol in water. Samples were loaded in 60% methanol in water and the first flowthrough was reapplied. The column was washed with 60% methanol in water and eluted in methanol. Following evaporation of the organic solvent, lipid extracts were resuspended in 100 \u03bcl mobile phase containing 60% of mobile phase A (acetonitrile:water, 60:40 (vol:vol) in 10 mM ammonium formate and 0.1% formic acid) and 40% mobile phase B (isopropanol:acetonitrile, 90:10 (vol:vol) in 10 mM ammonium formate and 0.1% formic acid), and transferred to silanized glass inlets in 2 ml glass vials with PTFE-coated caps. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Bligh EG, Dyer WJ.
