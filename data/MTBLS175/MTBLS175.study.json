                "description": "Centella asiatica is an important medicinal plant with a wide range of bioactivities associated with its secondary metabolites. Using two extraction procedures, metabolomic approaches were used to investigate changes in the metabolome of C. asiatica cells treated with exogenous MeJA. GC\u2013MS and LC\u2013MS platforms were employed for semi-targeted and untargeted analyses, respectively. Multivariate data analyses indicated concentration-dependent changes in the metabolite profiles, indicative of the cellular response to MeJA. Annotation of biomarkers correlated with the treatment indicate differential responses in flavonoid-, phenylpropanoid (cinnamates)- and terpenoid pathways and changes in fatty acid profiles. MeJA treatment triggered the accumulation of bicyclic sesquiterpenoids (aristolochene, deoxy-capsidiol, 15-hydroxysolavetivone, solavetivone, 3-hydroxylubimin) and a tricyclic sesquiterpenoid (phytuberin), indicating the stimulatory effect of MeJA on this branch of the terpenoid pathways. In contrast, flavonoids were mostly negatively correlated with the treatment. The presence of the sesquiterpenoids in MeJA-elicited cells and other tentatively identified metabolites (abscisic acid, fatty acids, phytosterols and metabolites of shikimate\u2013phenylpropanoid pathways) indicates that the changes in the metabolome are associated with a defensive function in response to elicitation by MeJA, rather than just the amplification of existing terpene pathways. These results provide a detailed and comprehensive picture of metabolic changes occurring in C. asiatica cells in response to MeJA elicitation and contribute to the understanding of flexible and controllable aspects of metabolic manipulation.",

To obtain callus proliferation, 1 g of callus was transferred aseptically to solid MS salt solution as described above. The cultures were kept in a culture room with 18/6 h light/dark cycle and the temperature was regulated at 23 \u00b0C for 21 days. In addition, callus was transferred to sterile liquid medium, to initiate cell suspensions. These were incubated on an orbital shaker in the dark at 23 \u00b0C. Every 7 days the homogenous cell suspension was subcultured in a 1:1 (v/v) ratio with fresh MS medium.\n</p>\nFor elicitation of cells, C. asiatica cell suspensions were treated by the application of MeJA (Sigma Aldrich, Munich, Germany) to obtain final concentrations of 100, 200 and 400 \u00b5M and incubated for 24 h with continuous rotation at 120 rpm and 25 \u00b0C. Non-treated C. asiatica cell suspensions, incubated in the same conditions as the MeJA-treated cells, were used as negative controls.

Chloroform extracts were prepared as previously described, using the dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (DLLME) method [1]. Briefly, 24 h post treatment, the excess media was filtered using a Buchner funnel and the cells were collected. 2 g of cells were re-suspended in 20 ml of methanol and homogenised using an Ultra Turrax homogenizer. The homogenates were centrifuged at 5525 x g for 7 min at 25 \u00b0C. The supernatants were placed into 50 ml round-bottom flasks, and the methanol evaporated to 1 ml at 50 \u00b0C using a Buchi Rotavapor R-200. To this, 1 ml of the crude aqueous extract, 200 \u00b5l of chloroform and 100 \u00b5l of methanol were added.  The mixture was vortexed for 30 s and centrifuged at 15,000 x g for 6 min at 25 \u00b0C in a glass centrifuge tube. Using a syringe, the bottom chloroform extraction layer was removed and filtered through 0.22 \u00b5m nylon filters, and placed into pre-labelled GC glass vials containing glass inserts and fitted with slitted caps. A general methanol extraction was carried out as previously described, with modification where necessary [2][3]. The resulting 50% methanol extracts were filtered through 0.22 \u00b5m filters and placed into pre-labelled UHPLC glass vials fitted with inserts and slitted caps.\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Tugizimana F, Steenkamp PA, Piater LA, Dubery IA (2012) Ergosterol-induced sesquiterpenoid synthesis in tobacco cells.

A 1 \u00b5l aliquot of chloroform sample was injected into the GC-MS instrument in splitless mode and the injection temperature of 250 \u00b0C. The overall programmed-temperature GC run included zones with different temperature gradient (multi-linear programming) with initial and final isothermal zones. The initial GC oven temperature was 40 \u00b0C for 4 min, increased by 25 \u00b0C/min to 240 \u00b0C, then increased to 300 \u00b0C at a rate of 5 \u00b0C/min and held at 300 \u00b0C for 5.00 min\n</p>\nLC-MS:</br>\nUHPLC and high-definition mass spectrometry (UHPLC\u2013HDMS) analyses were performed on a Waters Acquity UPLC coupled in tandem to a Waters photodiode array(PDA) detector and a SYNAPT G1 HDMS Q-TOF mass spectrometer (Waters Corporation, Manchester, UK). Chromatographic separation of methanol extracts was done utilising a Waters CSH C18 Acquity column (150 mm x 2.1 mm, 1.7 \u00b5m) thermostatted at 60 \u00b0C. A binary solvent mixture was used consisting of water (eluent A) containing 10 mM formic acid (pH 2.3) and acetonitrile (Romil Pure Chemistry, Cambridge, UK) (eluent B). The initial conditions were 95% A at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min and were kept constant for 2 min. A gradient was introduced to change the chromatographic conditions to 5% A at 22 min. The conditions were kept constant for 3 min to flush the analytical column where after the column was returned to initial conditions at 27 min and allowed to equilibrate for 3 min. The run time was 30 min and the injection volume was 5 \u00b5l. Each sample was analysed in triplicate, to account for any analytical variability.

The parameters were default settings except for the following: 6-25 min retention time (Rt) range of the chromatogram, ion m/z tolerance of 500 mDa, ion Rt tolerance of 0.5 min and ion intensity threshold of 1000 counts. The timebase \u2018Warping\u2019 method was used for the chromatogram alignment.\n</p>\nThe data matrices obtained from Profiling Solution processing were exported to SIMCA 13.0 software (Umetrics, Umea, Sweden) for principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal projection to latent structures-discriminant analysis / orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA).\n</p>\nLC-MS:</br>\nFor LC-MS data, ESI positive and negative raw data were extracted using MassLynxTM XS software and analysed with MarkerLynxTM software (Waters Corporation, Mildford, MA, USA). The MarkerLynx software extracts the raw LC-MS data and produces a matrix of Rt-m/z variable pairs, with the m/z peak intensity for each sample. Software parameters were set to analyse the 2-26 min Rt range of the chromatogram, mass range 100-700 Da, mass tolerance 0.01 Da, mass window 0.05 Da and a Rt window of 0.20 min.\n</p>\nThe data matrices obtained from MarkerLynx processing were exported to SIMCA 13.0 software (Umetrics, Umea, Sweden) for principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal projection to latent structures-discriminant analysis/orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA).\n</p>\nXCMS analyses of LC-MS data:</br>\nFollowing the upload of the raw data files (netCDF), parameters for XCMS processing were as follows: centWave for feature detection (with 15 ppm as a maximal tolerated m/z deviation in consecutive scans, minimum chromatographic peak width of 5 s and maximum peak width of 20 s); obwarp method for retention time correction (profStep = 1, step size to use for profile generation). The chromatogram alignment parameters included: minfrac of 0.5 (minimum fraction of samples necessary in at least one of the sample groups for it to be a valid group), bw of 5 s (allowable retention time deviations) and mzwid of 0.015 (width of overlapping m/z slices to use for peak density chromatograms and grouping peaks across samples). The relative quantification of metabolite features was based on EIC (extracted ion chromatogram) areas, and statistical test was performed using unpaired parametric t-test (Welch t-test) method, with p-value and fold change thresholds of 0.01 and 1.5 respectively for highly significant features and p-value threshold of 0.05 for significant features.",

For the LC-MS platform, selected mass ions obtained from MarkerLynx data were putatively identified using the Taverna workbench (www.taverna.org.uk) for PUTMEDID_LCMS metabolite identification workflows. The Taverna workflows allow for integrated, automated and high-throughput annotation and putative metabolite identification from LC-ESI-MS metabolomic data. The workflows consist of correlation analysis, metabolic feature annotation and metabolite annotation [2]. For the GC-EI-MS platform, the respective mass spectra of the extracted ion peaks of the selected mass ions from S- and VIP plots were searched against the NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) and Wiley mass spectra libraries (2007 versions) for similarity matches. This spectral comparison provided putative empirical formulae and structures, which were further searched in databases such as the Dictionary of Natural Products (www.dnp.chemnetbase.com) and ChemSpider (www.chemspider.com). The library search results were evaluated based on the probability factor, a match factor provided by the search algorithms that describes how unique a spectrum is, compared to all other spectra in the library [3][4]. Only spectra with probability hits in the range from 650 to 900 or above, were considered.\n</p>\nThe statistically selected features in XCMS analyses are automatically annotated by searching the METLIN metabolite database, producing thus a list of putative identities based on accurate mass measurements. In this study, the XCMS online annotation parameters were set as follows: isotopes and adducts search, m/z absolute error of 0, ppm error of 5 and the tolerance for database search of 10 ppm.\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Sumner LW, Amberg A, Barrett D et al (2007) Proposed minimum reporting standards for chemical analysis Chemical Analysis Working Group (CAWG) Metabolomics Standards Initiative (MSI).
