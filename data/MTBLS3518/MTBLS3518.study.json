                "description": "Rice is a staple food crop worldwide, and its production is severely threatened by phloem-feeding insect herbivores, particularly the brown planthopper (BPH, Nilaparvata lugens), and destructive pathogens. Despite the identification of many BPH resistance genes, the molecular basis of rice resistance to BPH remains largely unclear. Here, we report that the plant elicitor peptide (Pep) signalling confers rice resistance to BPH. Both rice PEP RECEPTORs (PEPRs) and PRECURSORs of PEP (PROPEPs), particularly OsPROPEP3, were transcriptionally induced in leaf sheaths upon BPH infestation. Knockout of OsPEPRs impaired rice resistance to BPH, whereas exogenous application of OsPep3 improved the resistance. Hormone measurement and co-profiling of transcriptomics and metabolomics in OsPep3-treated rice leaf sheaths suggested potential contributions of jasmonic acid biosynthesis, lipid metabolism and phenylpropanoid metabolism to OsPep3-induced rice immunity. Moreover, OsPep3 elicitation also strengthened rice resistance to the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae and bacterial pathogen Xanthamonas oryzae pv. oryzae and provoked immune responses in wheat. Collectively, this work demonstrates a previously unappreciated importance of the Pep signalling in plants for combating piercing-sucking insect herbivores and promises exogenous application of OsPep3 as an eco-friendly immune stimulator in agriculture for crop protection against a broad spectrum of insect pests and pathogens.",

Rice plants were routinely grown in a greenhouse with a cycle of 14 h light at 28 \u00b0C and 10 h dark at 25 \u00b0C. To evaluate the developmental phenotypes, rice seeds of ZH11 or ospepr1pepr2 plants harvested at the same time were surface-sterilized and placed on 1/2 MS agar medium in a plant growth chamber under the conditions described. A BPH laboratory strain obtained from the Guangdong Academy of Agricultural Sciences, the <em>M. oryzae</em> strain Guy11 and the <em>Xoo</em> strain PXO99A were used in this study.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Generation of plasmids and gene knockout plants</strong></p><p>The CRISPR-GE web server (http://skl.scau.edu.cn/targetdesign) was used for designing two gene-specific sgRNAs targeting OsPEPR1 or OsPEPR2 (OsPEPR1-sgRNA1: 5'-tagcccttctttctctgtct-3'; OsPEPR1-sgRNA2: 5'-Gtgcgctataccatagctct-3'; OsPEPR2-sgRNA1: 5'-GCTCAAACTACAACACAATG-3'; OsPEPR2-sgRNA2: 5'-atccgctacagcatagctct-3')<strong>[1]</strong>. The binary plasmid pYL-CRISPR/Cas9-OsPEPR1/2 simultaneously expressing these 4 sgRNAs was constructed according to the Golden Gate ligation procedure described previously<strong>[2]</strong>. The binary plasmid was transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain EHA105 cells through electroporation. Agrobacteria containing the plasmid were used for transforming rice callus. Transformed rice callus cells were selected by hygromycin resistance and regenerated into whole plants according to a standard protocol<strong>[3]</strong>. OsPEPR knockout plants were identified by Sanger sequencing of the PCR products spanning the target regions in individual transgenic lines.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>OsPep treatment </strong></p><p>OsPep peptides were synthesized by Xinghao Chemical (Wuhan, China) according to the sequences as follows: OsPep1: ARLRPKPPGNPREGSGGNGGHHH; OsPep2: DDSKPTRPGAPAEGSGGNGGAIH; OsPep3: ADSAPQRPGSPAEGAGGNGGAVH; OsPep7: SKPKPEPPGYPREGGGGNGGVVD. The OsPep solution was freshly prepared by dissolving the peptide powder in distilled water to a working concentration of 10 \u03bcM before plant application. The detergent silwet L-77 was added to the OsPep solution to a final concentration of 0.05% to facilitate plant penetration. The initial treatment was conducted by submerging the rice leaf sheath into the OsPep solution for 30 s. After BPH infestation, the leaf sheaths were treated by spraying the OsPep solution every 24 h.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Non-targeted metabolomics</strong></p><p><strong><em>Oryza sativa</em> wildtype ZH11</strong> (kindly provided by Prof. Yueqin Chen at the Sun Yat-sen University) and <strong>mutants ospepr1pepr2</strong> (transgenic plants generated by using CRSIPR-Cas9 technology) were grown in a greenhouse (Guangzhou, China) with a cycle of 14 h light at 28 \u00b0C and 10 h dark at 25 \u00b0C.&nbsp;Subsequently 1 month old rice plants were sprayed with 10 \u03bcM exogenous synthenic <strong>OsPep3 peptide</strong> (ADSAPQRPGSPAEGAGGNGGAVH) or mock for 24 h. A total of 200 mg leaf sheaths of each treatment were were collected as one sample. Samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen after collection. UPLC-MS/MS analysis was conducted by BGI group (Shenzhen, China).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Xie X, Ma X, Zhu Q, Zeng D, Li G, Liu YG.

Finally, the molecular weight, retention time, peak area and identification results were derived.</p><p><br></p><p>Data preprocessing was performed using <strong>metaX</strong>, the steps include: 1) the Normalization of Probabilistic Quotient (PQN) is used to normalize data and obtain relative peak area; 2) the batch effect is corrected through Quality Control-based sequeaurement of signals (QC-RLSC) which is a local polynomial regression fitting signal correction for real sample signals based on QC sample information; 3) compounds whose CV (Coefficient of Variation) of relative peak area was greater than 30% in all QC samples were deleted.</p>",
