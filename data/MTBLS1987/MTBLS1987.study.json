                "description": "Sex-related differences in Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) severity and mortality exist, with the male sex being a potential risk factor1. It was recently shown that patients with mild to moderate SARS-CoV-2 infection have elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and sex-differences in these immune responses. In this study, we used an untargeted metabolomics workflow with multivariable logistic regression to identify metabolites that were associated with COVID-19 disease. Serum samples were analyzed from COVID-19 patients (n=22 women and n=17 men), and healthcare worker (HCW) controls that had no evidence of COVID-19 disease (n=10 women and n=10 men). We further investigated the sex differences in the associations between metabolites and immune markers, and found that the relevance of kynurenic acid, KYAT and AhR activation in COVID-19 could be of utmost importance.",

These patients were enrolled through the IMPACT biorepository study after admission to the Yale-New Haven Hospital from March 23rd to May 1st, 2020. Prior to the serum collection, these patients were not in an intensive care unit (ICU), had not received tocilizumab (Toci), and had not received high dose corticosteroids (CS; prednisone equivalent &gt; 40 mg). Patients on hydroxychloroquine (n=29) and remdesivir (n=3) were not excluded. For control groups, we used 20 serum samples collected from COVID-19 uninfected health care workers (HCWs) working at the Yale-New Haven Hospital between April 2nd and April 28th who enrolled in the IMPACT study (women n=10, men n=10).</p><p><br></p><p>References:</p><p>[1] Takahashi&nbsp;T,&nbsp;Ellingson&nbsp;MK,&nbsp;Wong&nbsp;P,&nbsp;Israelow&nbsp;B,&nbsp;Lucas&nbsp;C, Klein&nbsp;J,&nbsp;Silva&nbsp;j et al.

Control samples were treated in the exactly the same manner. To precipitate proteins, the samples were incubated for 2 h at \u221220 \u00b0C, followed by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm (15,000\u00d7 g) and 4 \u00b0C for 15 min. The resulting supernatant was removed and evaporated to dryness for 12 h using a vacuum concentrator (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The dry extracts were then reconstituted in 100 \u00b5l of ACN:H2O (1:1, v/v), sonicated for 10 min, and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm (15,000\u00d7 g) and 4 \u00b0C for 15 min, to remove insoluble debris. The supernatant was transferred to UPLC autosampler vials (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). A pooled quality control (QC) sample was prepared by mixing 5 \u03bcl of extracted solution from each sample into a Ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) autosampler vial. All the vials were capped and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C prior to UPLC-mass spectrometry (MS) analysis.</p>",
