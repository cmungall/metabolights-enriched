                "description": "Perennial ryegrass (<i>Lolium perenne</i>) is integral to temperate pastoral agriculture, which contributes most of the milk and meat production worldwide. Chemical profiles and diversity of ryegrass offer several opportunities to harness specific traits and elucidate underlying biological mechanisms for forage improvement. We conducted a large-scale metabolomics study of perennial ryegrass comprising 715 genotypes, representing 118 populations from 21 countries. Liquid/gas chromatography-mass spectrometry based targeted and non-targeted techniques were used to analyse fructan oligosaccharides, lipids, fatty acid methyl esters, polar and semi-polar compounds. Fructan diversity across all genotypes was evaluated, high- and low-sugar groups identified, and fructan accumulation mechanisms explored. Metabolites differentiating the two groups were characterised, modules and pathways they represent deduced, and finally, visualisation and interpretation provided in a biological context. We also demonstrate a workflow for large-scale metabolomics studies from raw data through to statistical and pathway analysis. <br><br> <b>UPLC-MS C1 reverse phase NEG assay</b> is reported in the current study MTBLS68.<br> <b>UPLC-MS HILIC POS assay</b> is reported in <a href=https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS62>MTBLS62</a>.<br> <b>UPLC-MS HILIC NEG assay</b> is reported in <a href=https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS63>MTBLS63</a>.<br> <b>UPLC-MS C18 reverse phase POS assay</b> is reported in <a href=https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS64>MTBLS64</a>.<br> <b>UPLC-MS C18 reverse phase NEG assay</b> is reported in <a href=https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS65>MTBLS65</a>.<br> <b>UPLC-MS C1 reverse phase POS and GC-MS FAME assays</b> are reported in <a href=\"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS66\">MTBLS66</a>.<br> <b>HPLC-MS Hypercarb reverse phase NEG assay</b> is reported in <a href=https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS529>MTBLS529</a>.<br>",

A surrogate QC sample59 comprising random amounts of ground ryegrass leaf material, irrespective of the presence or absence of endophyte was used. Since this QC sample was not representative of the sample set, it was solely used for monitoring sample degradation and for tracking run-order effects within a batch, and not used for batch normalisations or ensuing data processing.\n</br></br>\nA single aliquot (50 mg) was used for analysing lipid compounds. 1 ml of extraction solvent comprising damp chloroform:methanol (67:33, v/v) and containing 2\u2032,7\u2032-Dichlorofluorescein (20 \u00b5g/ml) as an internal standard, were added to the aliquot. A ceramic bead was added and samples were mixed in a bead-mill homogeniser (TissueLyser II; Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) for 3 min, after which they were centrifuged for 6 min (18188 x g).

The mobile phase comprised water containing 0.1% formic acid (Solvent A) and isopropanol:acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid (50:50, v/v; Solvent B). The gradient was set to hold solvent A at 80% from 0-1 mins, gradually decline to 0% at 18.1 mins, maintained at the same level up to 20 mins, increased to 80% at 20.1 mins and finally allowed to equilibrate as such for the rest of the program, i.e. 25 mins. The samples were cooled in the auto-sampler at 4 \u00b0C and the injection volume of each sample was 2 \u03bcl. The first 1.5 min and the last 5 min of the chromatogram were diverted to waste.\n</br></br>\nFor each stream of analysis, samples (3575) were systematically randomised across 36 batches, making sure that 2 clonal replicates of a genotype were not present in the same batch.

The final data matrices of metabolic features were used for local library matching and statistical analysis. Metabolic features, defined here as molecular entities or ion types with a unique mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) and retention time.\n</br></br>\nLipid identification was performed using LipidSearch software (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA)[4]. Raw lipid files corresponding to high- and low-sugar groups were uploaded to LipidSearch separately for negative ionisation mode. Product ion search on Q-Exactive data was selected with a mass tolerance of 6 ppm for precursor ions and 10 ppm for product ions, along with a selection of lipid classes (see Table S4 in the paper associated with this study). Lipid species/classes identified for each file were then merged based on retention time alignments and a single file with the merged results, 1 each for each ionisation mode, was generated. This library of identified lipids was matched against the final data matrices based on parent mass and retention times. Peak intensities generated by XCMS settings for the identified lipids were ultimately used for further statistical analyses.\n</br></br>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Smith CA, Want EJ, O'Maille G, Abagyan R, Siuzdak G.
