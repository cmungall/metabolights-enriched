                "description": "Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are part of a new generation of epigenetic drugs for cancer treatment. It is known that histone acetylation plays a key role in controlling essential chromosome functions, including gene regulation, and this process has been linked with cancer development and progression. Better understanding of molecular mechanisms involving HDAC inhibitors is needed for the design of new targeted drugs, and also to evaluate the effectiveness of current treatments. In this study, an untargeted metabolomics approach was used to identify intracellular metabolite deregulation after treating cancer cell lines with the HDAC inhibitor HC-Toxin. Metabolomics analysis was performed using high resolution mass spectrometry, in combination with univariate and multivariate statistics and pathway analysis. HDAC inhibition showed highly specific metabolic changes in cancer cell lines compared to non-cancerous cells. In particular, N-acetyl-L-cysteine, N-acetylmethionine, and N-acetyl-L-carnitine showed a dose dependent change. Moreover, pathways controlling protein biosynthesis, as well as tryptophan, cysteine and methionine metabolism were significantly altered by HDAC inhibition. This study illustrates that HDAC inhibition has multiple effects on different metabolic pathways and our results can be extrapolated to inform on the molecular transitions in human cells.",

A stock solution of HC-toxin was prepared in DMSO at a concentration of 2 mM and the working concentrations were again dissolved in DMSO to achieve concentrations between 10-1000 \u00b5M. An equal number of cells (2 x 10^5 cells/ml) were seeded into 6 well plates (3 replicated per concentration) until 80% of confluence was reached. Once media was replaced, 2 \u00b5l of the drug at different concentrations were added to the wells, and plates were incubated for 24 h. Control cells were treated with sterile DMSO and in all cases concentration of DMSO was maintained at 0.1%.</p>",
