                "description": "The attenuating effects of green tea supplements (GTS) against the ultraviolet (UV) radiation induced skin damages are distinguished. However, the concomitant effects of GTS on the large intestinal microbiomes and associated metabolomes are largely unclear. Herein, we performed an integrated microbiome-metabolome analysis to uncover the esoteric links between gut microbiome and exo/endogenous metabolome maneuvered in the large intestine of UVB-exposed mice subjected to dietary GTS. In UVB-exposed mice groups (UVB), class Bacilli and order Bifidobacteriales were observed as discriminant taxa with decreased lysophospholipid levels compared to the unexposed mice groups subjected to normal diet (NOR). Conversely, in GTS fed UVB-exposed mice (U+GTS), the gut-microbiome diversity was greatly enhanced with enrichment in the classes, Clostridia and Erysipelotrichia, as well as genera, Allobaculum and Lachnoclostridium. Additionally, the gut endogenous metabolomes changed with an increase in amino acids, fatty acids, lipids, and bile acids contents coupled with a decrease in nucleobases and carbohydrate levels. The altered metabolomes exhibited high correlations with GTS enriched intestinal microflora. Intriguingly, the various conjugates of green tea catechins viz., sulfated, glucuronided, and methylated ones including their exogenous derivatives were detected from large intestinal contents and liver samples. Hence, we conjecture that the metabolic conversions for the molecular components in GTS strongly influenced the gut micro-environment in UVB-exposed mice groups, ergo modulate their gut-microbiome as well as exo/endogenous metabolomes.",

                        "description": "Female albino hairless mice (Skh:HR-1, 6\u20138 weeks old) were purchased from Orient Bio (Seongnam, Korea) and housed under controlled temperature (24 \u00b1 2 \u00b0C), humidity (55 \u00b1 10%), and light (12 h light/dark cycle) conditions. After 1 week of acclimation, the mice were randomly divided into 3 groups: Control (NOR) (n = 12), UVB exposed (UVB) (n = 12), and UVB-exposed and fed on diet containing 1% green tea extract (U+GTS) (n = 12). 4 fluorescent lamps (TL 20W/12 RS SLV, wavelength 290\u2013390 nm, peak emission 315 nm; Philips, Amsterdam, Netherlands) were used for UVB irradiation, and monitored intensity with a UV meter (VARIOCONTROL, Waldmann ver. 2.03, Germany). UVB irradiation was initiated with 75 mJ/cm^2 doses i.e.,1 minimal erythema dose or MED, ramped-up by 1 MED/week to 4 MED and maintained subsequently. The mice were exposed to UVB radiation 3 times a week. While UVB exposure, mice were moving freely in the cage, at a distance of 30 cm from the lamps. The NOR and UVB groups were fed a control diet (Ain-93G), whereas the U+GTS group was fed on 1% GTE diet (Ain-93G + 1% GTE). The GTE was provided by AmorePacific Corp. (Seoul, Korea), and contained 50% of the total catechins including EC, EGC, ECG, and EGCG. No significant differences in food intake and body weight of mice were observed among the groups based on weekly measurements (see Fig 1 in the paper associated with this study). After 10 weeks of animal experiment, the mice were sacrificed and their liver as well as large intestine (including contents) were collected, and subsequently stored at deep freezing condition (\u221280 \u00b0C). For preparing microbial DNA samples and metabolite extraction, we pulled out large intestinal contents from tissue. All the samples were used for metabolites extraction and 4 randomly selected samples were subjected to DNA preparation. All animal experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Gyeonggi Institute of Science & Technology (permit number: 2013-12-0006), and were performed in accordance with their guidelines. The animal experimental procedures were done to minimize suffering.",

Briefly, the sample extracts were analyzed on a Waters Micromass Q-TOF Premier with a UPLC Acquity system (Waters Corp., Milford, MA, USA) equipped with a binary solvent delivery system, an autosampler, and a UV detector. We selected an Acquity UPLC BEH C18 column (100 mm x 2.1 mm x 1.7 um particle size; Waters Corp.). The injection volume and flow rate were 5 \u03bcl and 0.3 ml/min, respectively. Mobile phases consisted of 0.1% formic acid in water (solvent A) and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile (solvent B); the initial condition was 5% B for 1 min, then B was gradually increased to 100% during 9 min; the 100% B was maintained for 1 min and then decreased to 5% B during 3 min. The total run time was 14 min.\n</p>\nGC-TOF-MS analysis was performed using an Agilent 7890 gas chromatograph system (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA), an Agilent 7693 auto-sampler (Agilent Technologies), and a Pegasus HT TOF MS (LECO, St. Joseph, MI, USA) system under previously described analytical conditions[2]. Briefly, an Rtx-5MS column (i.d., 30 m x 0.25 mm, 0.25 lm particle size; Restek Corp., Bellefonte, PA, USA) was used with a constant flow of 1.5 ml/min of helium as carrier gas. 1 \u03bcl aliquot of the sample was injected into the GC with split ratio of 5:1. The oven temperatures maintained at 75 \u00b0C for 2 min, followed by raised to 300 \u00b0C at 15 \u00b0C/min, and then, finally hold for 3 min. The temperatures of the front inlet and transfer line were 250 \u00b0C and 240 \u00b0C, respectively.\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Suh DH, Jung ES, Park HM, Kim SH, Lee S, Jo YH, Lee MK, Jung G, Do SG, Lee CH.

After conversion, the peak detection, retention time correction, and alignment were processed using the Metalign software package (http://www.metalign.nl). The resulting data were exported to an Excel file. Multivariate statistical analysis was conducted using SIMCA-P+ (version 12.0, Umetrics; Umea, Sweden). The data sets were auto-scaled (unit variance scaling) and mean-cantered in a column-wise fashion. Partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) was performed to compare each data set. The significance of PLS-DA model was determined by analysis of variance testing of cross-validated predictive residuals in SIMCA-P+ program. The variables were selected based on VIP value.",
