                "description": "<p>Clinical metabolic phenotyping employs metabolomics and lipidomics to detect and measure thousands of metabolites and lipids within human samples. This approach aims to identify metabolite and lipid changes between phenotypes (e.g. disease status) that aid understanding of biochemical mechanisms driving the phenotype. Sample preparation is a critical step in clinical metabolic phenotyping: it must be reproducible and give a high extraction yield of metabolites and lipids. Here, we assessed the extraction of polar metabolites from human urine and polar metabolites and lipids from human plasma for analysis by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS) metabolomics and lipidomics. We evaluated several monophasic (urine and plasma) and biphasic (plasma) extractions, and we also tested alterations to (a) solvent-biofluid incubation time and temperature during monophasic extraction, and (b) phase partitioning time during biphasic extraction. Extracts were analysed by three UHPLC-MS assays: (i) HILIC for urine and plasma, (ii) C18 aqueous reversed phase for urine, and (iii) C18 reversed phase for plasma lipids, and the yield and reproducibility of each method was assessed. For HILIC UHPLC-MS plasma and urine analysis, monophasic 50:50 methanol:acetonitrile had the most detected putatively-identified polar metabolites. If lipid removal from the plasma polar HILIC extract is required, then the biphasic methanol/chloroform/water method is recommended. For C18 (aqueous) UHPLC-MS urine analysis, 50:50 methanol:water had high reproducibility and yield. For C18 UHPLC-MS plasma lipidomics, monophasic 100% isopropanol had the highest detection response of all annotated lipid classes. Increasing monophasic incubation time and temperature had little benefit on metabolite and lipid yield and reproducibility.</p>",

Samples were centrifuged (21,000 x g, 20 min, 4 \u00b0C) and 100 \u03bcl of the supernatant was aliquoted into a low recovery volume HPLC vial (Chromatography Direct, UK). n=4 extraction replicates were conducted for each solvent type and preparation condition (n=3 of these were analysed; and the remaining n=1 was used to create a pooled QC sample, see \u2018Extract blank and quality control (QC) sample preparation\u2019 section.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><u>Plasma monophasic sample preparation.</u></strong></p><p>This protocol was the same as the urine monophasic preparation except 50 \u03bcl plasma was used instead of urine and different solvents were used: (a) for polar metabolite extraction and subsequent HILIC UHPLC-MS analysis the added solvent was 100% ACN or 100% MeOH or 50:50 ACN:MeOH; and (b) for lipid extraction and subsequent C18 reversed-phase lipid UHPLC-MS analysis the added solvent was 100% ACN or 25:75 ACN:IPA or 50:50 ACN:IPA or 75:25 ACN:IPA or 100% IPA.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><u>Plasma biphasic sample preparation.</u></strong></p><p>3 biphasic extractions were applied (a) CHCl3:MeOH:H2O, (b) DCM:MeOH:H2O or (c) MTBE:MeOH:H2O. For the CHCl3:MeOH:H2O method, 320 \u03bcl ice-cold methanol and 78 \u03bcl ice-cold water was added to plasma (50 \u03bcl, thawed on ice) and vortexted (60 s). Then, 320 \u03bcl ice-cold chloroform and 160 \u03bcl ice-cold water was added and sample was vortexed (60 s), incubated (on ice, 10 min) and centrifuged (21,000-g, 10 min, 4\u00b0C). The final solvent ratio was 2:2:1.8 CHCl3:MeOH:H2O (assuming plasma is 100% water). The sample was set at room temperature (approximately 20\u00b0C) to allow biphase partitioning for either: (i) 1 min or (ii) 20 min. 70% of the polar phase (377 \u03bcl) was removed and dried in a SpeedVac sample concentrator (Savant SPD111V230, Thermo Fisher Scientific). 70% of the non-polar phase (273 \u03bcl) was removed and dried using a nitrogen blow down drier (Techne FSC400D, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The DCM:MeOH:H2O method was conducted as above except: dichloromethane was used instead of chloroform; here 70% of the final polar phase was 442 \u03bcl and 70% of the non-polar phase was 228 \u03bcl. The MTBE:MeOH:H2O method used different solvent ratios to the two methods above (final solvent ratio of 2.6:2:2.4 MTBE:MeOH:H2O). This was conducted as for the CHCl3:MeOH:H2O method above except: initially 320 \u03bcl ice-cold methanol and 78 \u03bcl ice-cold water was added to the plasma (50 \u03bcl); and the second solvent addition step was 416 \u03bcl ice-cold MTBE and 256 \u03bcl ice-cold water. Here, 70% of the final polar phase was 549 \u03bcl and 70% of the non-polar phase was 235 \u03bcl. All polar extracts were resuspended in 140 \u03bcl 75:25 ACN:H2O and non-polar extracts were resuspended in 140 \u03bcl 75:25 IPA:H2O, to match the plasma dilution of the monophasic methods (and the same solvent composition as the 100% ACN or 100% IPA monophasic preparations, above). Samples were vortexed (30 s), centrifuged (21,000 x g, 20 min, 4\u00b0C) and 100 \u03bcl of the supernatant was aliquoted into a low recovery volume HPLC vial. n=4 extraction replicates were done for each solvent type and extraction condition (n=3 of these were analysed; and the remaining n=1 was used to create a pooled QC sample, see \u2018Extract blank and quality control (QC) sample preparation, below.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><u>Extract blank and quality control (QC) sample preparation.</u></strong></p><p>Extract blank samples were prepared for each method by substituting 50 \u03bcl of water for the plasma or urine.

Features were retained in the data matrix if they were: present in &gt;70% of QC samples; had a peak area relative standard deviation (RSD)&lt;30% across QC samples; and had an extract blank/mean QC area ratio of &lt;5%. This filtering retains highly robust and reproducible features across 8-14 QC injections over a &gt;24 h period, an important step as feature stability and reproducibility over a long time period is essential for metabolic phenotyping studies. Only features with putative metabolite annotations (a matched metabolic formula from PUTMEDID-LCMS (see Metabolite Identification section) were retained. For each putatively annotated metabolite, only the metabolite ion form with the largest peak area were retained (using mean peak area of all samples across all preparation conditions).</p><p><br></p><p><strong><u>Statistics.</u></strong></p><p>For each preparation method, un-normalised peak area RSD values were calculated for peaks present in all three sample preparation replicates or UHPLC-MS injection triplicates. Venn diagrams [4] were generated using the R programming language (https://www.R-project.org). For principal components analysis the above filtered data matrices were processed to retain peaks present across &gt;80% of all samples. Then matrices were normalised (probabilistic quotient normalisation [5]), missing data values were imputed (k nearest neighbour, kNN) and a generalised log transformation was applied [6]. PCA was conducted using PLS Toolbox in Matlab. The other processing steps were executed using the R programming language (https://github.com/computational-metabolomics/pmp).</p><p><br></p><p>Ref:</p><p>[1] Kessner, D.; Chambers, M.; Burke, R.; Agus, D.; Mallick, P.
