                "description": "The peanut worm (Sipunculus nudus) is an economically important fishery resource in China. To determine how dietary carbohydrate and protein levels affects the growth performance of juvenile S. nudus and identify the mechanisms underlying observedpatterns, five isoenergetic and isolipidic diets with different levels of carbohydrate and protein were formulated and fed to juvenile S. nudus; the experimental groups were referred to as EG1, EG2, EG3, EG4, and EG5, respectively. After 90 days of feeding, S. nudus had significantly lower survival rates when fed D5 compared with other diets (P < 0.05), and the highest survival rate was observed in EG2 individuals. The weight gain rate and specific growth rate were significantly higher in EG2 compared with the other groups (P < 0.05). Metabolomic profiling using LC\u2013MS revealed 83 significantly differential metabolites (POS: 59; NEG: 24), which were identified via an in-house MS2 database. Pathway analysis indicated that the significantly different metabolites were involved in 22 metabolic pathways (POS: 9; NEG: 13), including tyrosine, phenylalanine, and tryptophan biosynthesis; phenylalanine metabolism; D-glutamate and D-glutamine metabolism; proline and arginine metabolism; aspartate, alanine, and glutamate metabolism; and aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis. These analyses implied that the biosynthetic capabilities of juvenile S. nudus were greater in the EG2. The results of this research enhance our understanding of the effects of dietary carbohydrate and protein levels on the growth performance of juvenile S. nudus.",

Proteins were obtained from fish meal, Spirulina platensis powder, yeast powder, and soybean meal; carbohydrates were obtained from starch and kelp powder; and lipids were obtained from fish oils, average crude lipid level was 8.71%. The formulated&nbsp;diets were ground into desirable particle sizes (180 mesh). The ingredients and proximate composition of the formulated diets are shown in <strong>Table S1 </strong>in the paper associated with this study. The amino acid profiles of the formulated diets are shown in <strong>Table S2</strong> in the paper associated with this study. <strong>D1\u2013D5</strong> were fed to animals (mean total weight: 1.55 \u00b1 0.25 g) in five groups: <strong>EG1</strong>, <strong>EG2</strong>, <strong>EG3</strong>, <strong>EG4</strong>, and <strong>EG5</strong>, respectively; each experimental group had 3 replicates, and each replicate (1 m^2) had 120 animals. The experiment was run for 90 days. During the experiment, the juvenile peanut worms were fed twice at 8:00 and 20:00 per day, and up to 3% of their total biomass each time.
