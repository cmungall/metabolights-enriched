                "description": "<p>The aim of this paper is to provide a detailed characterisation of grape lipidome. To achieve this objective, it starts by describing a pipeline implemented in R software to allow the semi-automatic annotation of the detected lipid species. It also provides an extensive description of the different properties of each molecule (such as retention time dependencies, mass accuracy, adduct formation and fragmentation patterns), which allowed the annotations to be made more accurately. Most annotated lipids in the grape samples were (lyso)glycerophospholipids and glycerolipids, although a few free fatty acids, hydroxyceramides and sitosterol esters were also observed. The proposed pipeline also allowed the identification of a series of methylated glycerophosphates never previously observed in grapes. The current results highlight the importance of expanding chemical analyses beyond the classical lipid categories.</p>",

                        "description": "<p>The sampling of the obtained plant material was carried out during the 2019 winegrowing season in a commercial vineyard of Vitis vinifera L. cv. Ribolla Gialla, located in Corno di Rosazzo (North-eastern Italy; 46\u00b000'19.1'' North; 13\u00b026'30.6'' East; elevation 94 m a.s.l.) in the Friuli Venezia Giulia region, within the Friuli Colli Orientali and Ramandolo D.O.C. district. The vineyard was planted with Ribolla Gialla clone VCR 100 (Vivai Cooperativi Rauscedo, Rauscedo, Italy) grafted on Kober 5BB rootstock. The vines were trained into a single arched Guyot and were managed according to standard practices adopted in the winegrowing region. Vines with no evident sign of irregularities or disease symptoms were selected prior to veraison for sequential sampling of grape bunches throughout the berry ripening period. A total of 13 sampling points (from 6 August to 24 September 2019) were established to examine the possible variations in the lipid profile during the final stage of maturation. As with the other varieties grown in the same area, Ribolla Gialla normally reaches harvest maturity at the beginning and in the second part of September for sparkling and still wine production, respectively. At maturation, sugar accumulation is limited, the level of titratable acidity sustained, and the musts present a low concentration of aroma compounds, mostly of fermentation origin. These characteristics make Ribolla Gialla particularly suitable for sparkling wine production. For the first 11 sampling points, 5 biological replicates were collected and for the last 2 timepoints 3 biological replicates were collected. Only the final point of grape maturation was considered for the characterisation of the lipidome of the various compartments of the Ribolla Gialla grape berry. The total soluble solids measurement expressed in \u00b0Brix was used to determine the level of maturation, using a manual refractometer (ATC-1, Tokyo, Japan). After harvesting, healthy berries with pedicels were randomly separated from the bunch and divided into 2 batches, each one containing 100 berries. One batch was stored at -80 \u00b0C intact, while the skins, pulp and seeds from the other batch were manually separated, washed in deionised water, carefully dried with filter paper and frozen separately until analysis. Prior to lipid extraction, the detached berry compartments (i.e., grape seeds, pulp and skins) were homogenised separately under liquid nitrogen using a CryoMill (Retsch Technology, Haan, Germany), while the whole berries were crushed using an IKA A11 mill (Staufen, Germany). The extraction procedure for all the plant material (approximately 100 mg per sample) was based on the modified Folch method<strong>[1]</strong> and is described in detail elsewhere<strong>[2]</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Folch J, Lees M, Sloane Stanley GH.

Based on the Folch method<strong>[2]</strong>, a pre-existing protocol<strong>[3]</strong> was followed for the extraction of the lipids from the grape powder, with some minor modifications. Briefly, 300 \u00b5L of CH3OH was added to the previously weighted 100 mg of frozen grape powder into an Eppendorf microtube, and the mixture was vortexed for 30 s. Afterwards, 600 \u00b5L of CHCl3, containing butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT 500 mg/L) was added, with 15 \u00b5L of IS (10 mg/mL), and placed in an orbital shaker for 60 min. Subsequently, 250 \u00b5L of Milli-Q purified H2O was added to the extracting mixture, followed by centrifugation at 3600 rpm for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C. The total lipid-rich layer was collected into the fresh Eppendorf microtube. For the second round of extraction, 400 \u00b5L of CHCl3:CH3OH:H2O (86:13:1, v/v/v) was used, followed by centrifugation, extraction, and the addition of the lower lipid phase to the previously obtained lipid fraction. The remaining solvent present in the samples was then evaporated under a stream of N2, and the dried extracts were reconstituted in 300 \u03bcL of IPA.</p><p><br></p><p>Quality control (QC) samples represented a pool of all study samples in equal proportions. A series of solvents and QC samples were initially injected to evaluate the stability and repeatability of instrument performance. In the FS runs, all study samples were injected randomly and a sequence of one solvent followed by two QC samples were injected at regular intervals every 10 study samples throughout the analytical run. Solvent samples were included to pinpoint potential background signals and to discard signals associated with sample preparation and the analysis process, whereas QC samples were used to monitor the analytical variation associated with the instrument. Together with study samples, triplicates of a 6-point dilution series of QC samples were randomised. They were performed by injecting 2.5, 5 and 10 \u00b5L of a raw QC sample and a 10-fold diluted QC sample and were used to assess the linearity response of the annotated compounds.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Gika HG, Theodoridis GA, Vrhovsek U, Mattivi F.

Peak areas of each annotated compound were re-calculated using always the same corresponding m/z and RT windows for all samples by using the function 'manualChromPeaks' implemented in the <strong>R</strong> package '<strong>XCMS</strong>'<strong>[4]</strong>. Missing values were further compound-wise replaced by a random value between 0 and the corresponding minimum value.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>DDA data:</strong></p><p>We focused on those detected features with at least one MS2 spectra measured. Firstly we have performed the chromatographic peak detection on the MS level 1 data with the 'findChromPeaks' function of <strong>XCMS</strong> <strong>R</strong> package<strong>[4]</strong> (version 3.18.0) followed by a peak refinement through 'refineChromPeaks-filter-intensity' function to remove chromatographic peaks not fulfilling the 'prefilter' parameter used for peak picking. Peak picking was performed using 'centWave' algorithm with the following parameters: mass tolerance, 20 ppm; peak width range, 5-40 s; signal-to-noise threshold, 5; noise, 100; mzdiff, 0.001; integration method, 2; and a prefilter of at least 5 consecutive peaks with an intensity of at least 100,000 or 10,000 counts for positive and negative ionization modes, respectively. MS1 features were defined by the correspondence analysis using the 'peak density' algorithm with the parameters binSize = 0.02 and bw = 3. Chromatographic peaks had to be detected in all samples of at least one group in order to be considered as a feature (i.e., minFraction = 1). Next step was to extract all MS2 spectra that were associated with each feature following the workflow presented in the <strong>XCMS</strong> vignette for LC-MS/MS data analysis (<a href='https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/xcms/inst/doc/xcms-lcms-ms.html' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/xcms/inst/doc/xcms-lcms-ms.html</a>). Only MS1 features for which at least one MS2 spectra was available were considered for annotation. In the case of multiple MS2 spectra measured for a specific feature, the MS2 spectra were combined using the 'combineSpectra' method from <strong>Spectra R</strong> package<strong>[3]</strong> (version 1.6.0) by summing up the intensities and keeping those fragments present in at least half of the MS2 spectra.&nbsp;We kept the first isotopic peak (i.e., the one corresponding to the M\u00b1H monoisotopic ion), firstly grouping the features based on similar retention times using the function 'groupFeatures-similar-rtime' of the <strong>MsFeatures R</strong> package<strong>[2]</strong> (version 1.4.0) and then applying the 'isotopologues' function of <strong>MetaboCoreUtils R</strong> package<strong>[2]</strong> (version 1.4.0) within each RT-based feature group to collect features that potentially represent isotopologues of the same original compound.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Chambers MC, Maclean B, Burke R, Amodei D, Ruderman DL, Neumann S, Gatto L, Fischer B, Pratt B, Egertson J, Hoff K, Kessner D, Tasman N, Shulman N, Frewen B, Baker TA, Brusniak MY, Paulse C, Creasy D, Flashner L, Kani K, Moulding C, Seymour SL, Nuwaysir LM, Lefebvre B, Kuhlmann F, Roark J, Rainer P, Detlev S, Hemenway T, Huhmer A, Langridge J, Connolly B, Chadick T, Holly K, Eckels J, Deutsch EW, Moritz RL, Katz JE, Agus DB, MacCoss M, Tabb DL, Mallick P.

                        "description": "<p>To ensure high-confidence accurate identification, annotation was performed and verified using information from different properties. In the specific case of the manual curation, for each putative annotation the following attributes were considered: <strong>1)</strong> Accurate match of m/z value of the precursor ion, defined by the nature of the ion showing the maximal ionisation efficiency (i.e., (de)protonated ion or any specific adduct), taking advantage of the complementarity of the information provided simultaneously by each ionisation mode (e.g., for phosphatidylethanolamines (PE) [M+H]+ and [M-H]-; for phosphatidylcholines (PC) [M+H]+ and [M+HCO2]-; for monogalactosyldiacylglycerols (MGDG) and digalactosyldiacylglycerols (DGDG) [M+NH4]+ and [M+HCO2]+; and for diglycerides (DG) and triglycerides (TG) [M+NH4]+). <strong>2)</strong> The relationship between RT and the compound's Kendrick mass defect (KMD). In reversed-phase liquid chromatography, there is a class-specific relationship between RT and the KMD value, which links the total length of fatty acyl chains and the number of double bonds<strong>[1][2]</strong>. <strong>3)</strong> MS/MS fragmentation pattern in both polarity modes: it is well known that the fragmentation pattern depends on both the lipid class and the ionisation mode<strong>[2][3]</strong>. Therefore, characteristic fragment ions or neutral losses in the MS/MS spectra can be used to confirm the lipid class (e.g., fragment at m/z 184.073 for lysophosphatidylcholines (LPC) or neutral loss of 141.0191 for PE in positive mode), whereas in other cases they made it possible to deduce the specific fatty acyl chains of that lipid (e.g., the fragment at m/z 255.2330 for phosphatidic acids (PA), PE, phosphatidylglycerols (PG) and phosphatidylinositols (PI) in negative mode was an indicator that that compound contained at least one 16:0 fatty acyl chain).</p><p><br></p><p>These 3 checks constitute the 'Manual Verification Workflow' of the pipeline. The identification workflow was carried out using the recently developed <strong>R</strong> based ecosystem for metabolomics data annotation within the '<strong>RforMassSpectrometry</strong>' initiative<strong>[4]</strong>. The workflow combines recursive steps of database creation/update and sample annotation. In practice, newly annotated species are iteratively added to the annotation database which is then used to recursively improve the annotation coverage.</p><p><br></p><p>The initial step of the process was to build an in-house database using the <strong>CompoundDb</strong> package (version 1.0.1), containing both theoretical information (i.e., chemical formula) and experimental information (i.e., RT and main ion species observed for each compound) on a collected set of available chemical standards, which were analysed using the same LC-MS setup as that used to analyse the study samples (database v0). This 'database v0' was then used for the initial annotations of the samples focusing, as mentioned previously, solely on the features with at least one MS2 spectrum. Annotation was performed based on m/z values and RTs using the <strong>MetaboAnnotation</strong> package (version 1.0.0). Before proceeding, the quality of the annotation was verified with the above-mentioned 'Manual Verification Workflow'.</p><p><br></p><p>As expected, with this initial version of the database, most of the detected features remained unannotated. The database was then expanded by including all potential molecular formulas calculated from all possible combinations of fatty acyl chains ranging in chain length from 12 to 24 carbon atoms and up to 6 double bonds, with the exception of sphingolipids for which it was considered that their fatty acyl chains could be made of up to 28 carbon atoms. This extended version of the database (database v1.0) was used to perform a second round of annotation, which was manually curated following the standard workflow (i.e., 'Manual Verification'). The manually curated set of annotations constituted the basis for the evolution of the annotation database (database v1.1), which was once again used for a further annotation run, based, in this case, on m/z and RT. As a final step, among the still non-annotated features, possible m/z matches were sought in dedicated databases such as <strong>LIPID MAPS</strong> (<a href='https://www.lipidmaps.org/data/structure/LMSDSearch.php?Mode=SetupTextOntologySearch' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>https://www.lipidmaps.org/data/structure/LMSDSearch.php?Mode=SetupTextOntologySearch</a>), as well as in the scientific literature. An attempt was also made to identify clusters of features showing similar fragmentation patterns, as well as potential grid-like patterns for the associations between their RT and KMD. This information was used to further expand the database (v2.0), eventually populating it with additional experimental information (v2.1). This last version of the database was that used to generate the table with the compounds identified in the current samples.</p><p><br></p><p>In general, and where possible, fragmentation patterns were defined based on the information provided by the HRMS analysis using the DDA mode in both the positive and the negative ionisation modes. For those compounds for which the chemical standard was available, the MS/MS spectrum similarity was visualised by means of a mirror plot. In the other cases, the fragmentation pattern was verified according to the information available in <strong>LIPID MAPS</strong>, the scientific literature and/or using the <strong>MetFrag</strong> in silico fragmentation tool<strong>[5]</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p>Following the recommendations of the LIPID MAPS consortium<strong>[6]</strong>, lipids were identified at species level through sum composition (i.e., total number of carbon atoms and total number of double bonds on fatty acyl chains, e.g. PA 34:2) or at molecular species level, when there was enough information from MS/MS data to deduce the fatty acyl chains (e.g., PA 16:0_18:2). The lipid species level (e.g., PA 34:2) is the more general level of annotation and was obtained from the information provided by the FS data alone, namely, firstly by the accurate m/z values and secondly by the RTs-KMD associations. Whenever sufficiently informative DDA mass spectra were available, annotation was refined to molecular species level (e.g., PA 16:0_18:2). It should be noted that the provided annotations do not distinguish positional isomers (i.e., sn-attachment of fatty acids), the positions and configuration of double bonds (i.e., cis- or transconfigurations), and the stereoisomers (R or S). Since the positional isomeric level of the FACs on the glycerol backbone is uncertain, an underscore '_' is employed between fatty acyl constituents<strong>[6]</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Lange M, Angelidou G, Ni Z, Criscuolo A, Schiller J, Bl\u00fcher M, Fedorova M.
