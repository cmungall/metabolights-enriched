                "description": "<p>Characterization of botanical extracts by mass spectrometry-based metabolomics analysis helps in determining the phytochemical composition that underlies their bioactivity and potential health benefits, while also supporting reproducibility of effects in clinical trials. The quantification of seven withanolides in Withania somnifera using three mass-spectrometry methods was evaluated using Deming regression. Two high-resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometry methods were used, one operating in data-dependent acquisition mode and the other in parallel-reaction-monitoring mode with an inclusion list. The two high-resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometry methods were compared to a multiple-reaction-monitoring method. We evaluated in-source fragmentation of steroidal glycosides and optimized the methods accordingly. A novel software approach to integrating parallel-reaction-monitoring data acquired with an inclusion list was developed. Combining and comparing quantitative results allowed for quantitative specificity, good precision,  and adjustment of instrument source conditions for optimal quantification by multiple-reaction-monitoring mass spectrometry, an analytical method that is widely accessible in analytical and phytochemical laboratories.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Linked R Script</strong></p><p>An R script for PRM data analysis collected with an inclusion list is available in <a href='https://github.com/marneylc/prm' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>Github</a>.</p>",

For detecting ions, the following parameter settings were used to operate the mass spectrometer: spray voltage 5500 V; source temperature 550 \u00b0C and a period cycle time of 700 ms was used. In addition, the following settings were used: full scan with ion accumulation of 250 ms, followed by a dynamic MS/MS selection of the 4 most intense ions with 100 ms accumulation. After 3 MS/MS acquisitions, the precursor ions (fragmented) were excluded for 30 s. Collision energy was 35 V with collision energy spread (CES) of 10 V ramped through each MS/MS scan using a range of<strong> m/z 70\u20131100</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p>Parallel reaction monitoring with an inclusion list (<strong>PRM</strong>) was conducted using a <strong>AB SCIEX TripleTOF 5600</strong> mass spectrometer with an inclusion list of 93 masses and retention times. MS2 spectra were collected during a 1 min window around known retention times of each mass in positive ionization mode. Precursor signals for ions in the inclusion list must exceed 50 cps to collect MS2 data. The maximum number of candidate ions per cycle was set to 8. A spray voltage of 5500 V, source temperature 550 \u00b0C, and a cycle time of 1.1001 s was used. Additional parameters are as follows: full scan with ion accumulation of 250 ms, followed by MS/MS selection on inclusion list ions with a 100 ms accumulation; no MS/MS acquisitions of precursor (fragmented) ions were excluded. Collision energy was 35 V with collision energy spread (CES) of 10 V ramped through each MS/MS scan using a range of<strong> m/z 70\u20131100</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p>Selected <strong>WS </strong>components were quantified by LC-<strong>MRM</strong>-MS using a <strong>Waters Xevo TQ-XS</strong> equipped with an Acquity UPLC I class system and Z-spray source (Waters, Milford, MA, USA). ESI+ had the following parameters: capillary voltage, 2.1 kV; source temperature, 150 \u00b0C; cone gas flow rate, 150 L/h; desolvation gas flow rate, 800 L/h; desolvation temperature, 400 \u00b0C. Cone voltage and collision energy were optimized for each compound. Data was acquired in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode using MassLynx 4.1 software, tracking the transition of precursor/product ion specific for each compound (Supplementary Table 2). The <strong>WS</strong> components were identified by comparison with retention time and ions of individual standards, and the quantification was conducted using TargetLynx 4.2. A chromatogram is shown for the 7 target compounds in Fig 2 of the paper associated to this study.</p>",
