                "description": "<p>CD8+ T cells detect and kill virally infected or cancerous cells. When activated from their na\u00efve state, T cells undergo a complex transition, including major metabolic reprogramming. Detailed resolution of metabolic dynamics of a wide range of metabolites is needed to advance the field of immunometabolism. Here we outline methodologies that when utilized in parallel achieve broad coverage of the metabolome. Specifically, we used a combination of 2 FIA and 3 LC methods in combination with positive and negative mode high resolution MS to study the transition from na\u00efve to effector T cells with fine-grained time resolution. Depending on the method, between 54% and 98% of cellular metabolites change in a time-dependent manner, with the major changes in both polar metabolites and lipids occurring in the first 48 h. Statistical analysis highlighted remodeling of the polyamine biosynthesis pathway, with marked differences in the dynamics of precursors, intermediates, and cofactors. Moreover, phosphatidylcholines, the major class of membrane lipids, underwent a drastic shift in acyl chain composition with polyunsaturated species decreasing from 60% to 25% and specifically depleting species containing a 20:4 fatty acid. We hope that these MS methodologies and data set of over 11000 features and 9 time points will be a useful resource for future work.</p>",

Cells to be harvested at different time points were plated in separate wells of a 6-well plate to avoid continuously disturbing cultures during activation. Every 12 h, cells in the relevant well were suspended in their culture medium by pipetting and counted using a Neubauer chamber. A volume equivalent to 3 x 10^6 cells was removed for sample prep (see Extraction below), and the remaining cells in that well were discarded. Following 48 h activation, every 24 h T cells were counted and plated back at 1.5 x 10^6 in RPMI 1640 medium as above (minus CD3 and CD28) to prevent cell density from getting too high due to increased proliferation.</p>",

In the case of missing values, these gaps were filled by extracting signal intensities from the original data at the exact m/z values.

                        "description": "<p><strong>FIA-MS:</strong></p><p>The FIA method has been adapted from a previously published method<strong>[1]</strong>. Just prior to analysis, samples were resuspended in 150 \u00b5l FIA buffer. FIA buffer was 0.5% Agilent ESI-L Low concentration tuning mix in 80:20 acetonitrile:water. Subsequently, samples were diluted 10-fold in FIA buffer, transferred to sample vials with conical glass insert, capped, and placed in the autosampler. An aliquot of FIA buffer was used as a solvent blank sample.</p><p><br></p><p>An Agilent 1290 Infinity II UHPLC system was used to deliver samples to the mass spectrometer. A constant flow of 150 \u00b5l/min of carrier buffer was used to transport samples from the autosampler to the MS. Carrier buffer was for negative mode 10 mM NH4OH in 80:20 acetonitrile:water and for positive mode 10 mM ammonium formate in 80:20 acetonitrile:water. The injection volume was 3 \u00b5l and samples were injected twice (technical duplicates). Autosampler temperature was 5 \u00b0C.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Fuhrer T, Heer D, Begemann B, Zamboni N.
