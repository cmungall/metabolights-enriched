                "title": "Divergent relationships between faecal microbiota and metabolome following distinct antibiotic-induced disruptions",
                "description": "The intestinal microbiome plays an essential role in regulating many aspects of host physiology, and its disruption through antibiotic exposure has been implicated in the development of a range of serious pathologies. The complex metabolic relationships that exist between members of the intestinal microbiota and the potential redundancy in functional pathways mean that an integrative analysis of changes in both structure and function are needed to understand the impact of antibiotic exposure. We used a combination of next-generation sequencing and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) metabolomics to characterize the effects of two clinically important antibiotic treatments, ciprofloxacin and vancomycin-imipenem, on the intestinal microbiomes of female C57BL/6 mice. This assessment was performed longitudinally and encompassed both antibiotic challenge and subsequent microbiome reestablishment. Both antibiotic treatments significantly altered the microbiota and metabolite compositions of fecal pellets during challenge and recovery. Spearman's correlation analysis of microbiota and NMR data revealed that, while some metabolites could be correlated with individual operational taxonomic units (OTUs), frequently multiple OTUs were associated with a significant change in a given metabolite. Furthermore, one metabolite, arginine, can be associated with increases/decreases in different sets of OTUs under differing conditions. Taken together, these findings indicate that reliance on shifts in one data set alone will generate an incomplete picture of the functional effect of antibiotic intervention. A full mechanistic understanding will require knowledge of the baseline microbiota composition, combined with both a comparison and an integration of microbiota, metabolomics, and phenotypic data. IMPORTANCE Despite the fundamental importance of antibiotic therapies to human health, their functional impact on the intestinal microbiome and its subsequent ability to recover are poorly understood. Much research in this area has focused on changes in microbiota composition, despite the interdependency and overlapping functions of many members of the microbial community. These relationships make prediction of the functional impact of microbiota-level changes difficult, while analyses based on the metabolome alone provide relatively little insight into the taxon-level changes that underpin changes in metabolite levels. Here, we used combined microbiota and metabolome profiling to characterize changes associated with clinically important antibiotic combinations with distinct effects on the gut. Correlation analysis of changes in the metabolome and microbiota indicate that a combined approach will be essential for a mechanistic understanding of the functional impact of distinct antibiotic classes.",

All mice were initially housed in 1 barrier room within the facility and then transferred to an isolator on commencement of antibiotic treatment, where they were divided into 3 groups of 8 mice each (4 mice per cage). The 3 groups represented a control group (no treatment), and 2 antibiotic treatment groups (either vancomycin-imipenem or ciprofloxacin). 6 week old mice were placed on the same diet (a VRF1 diet, SDS) and antibiotics were dosed at 50 mg/kg/day delivered in drinking water. Fresh medicated solutions were prepared weekly and stored at 4 \u00b0C. Water was changed twice weekly and mice were observed closely for any changes in hydration or adverse effects; mice were weighed once a week throughout the study. No significant differences in mass were observed between groups during the study with mice in control, ciprofloxacin and vancomycin-imipenem groups attaining masses of 19.26 \u00b1 1.38 g, 19.45 \u00b1 1.11 and 19.03 \u00b1 0.81 g respectively. 1 faecal pellet was taken from each mouse at 3 time points: T1) Prior to commencement of antibiotic treatment, T2) At termination of treatment after 14 days on antibiotics, T3) 9 days after antibiotic treatment ceased. After collection, pellets were placed into separate, sterile collection tubes and frozen at -80 \u00b0C prior to analysis.",

                        "description": "Microbial data were analyzed for alpha diversity measures (taxon richness, S; Shannon-Wiener index, H; Simpson diversity index, 1 to D) of the microbial community using PAST (v3.04)[1]. Operational taxonomic unit (OTU) relative abundance was imported into the Primer-E software (v.6; Primer-E Ltd., Plymouth, United Kingdom) for beta diversity analysis. Bray-Curtis similarities were calculated based on the square root-transformed OTU relative abundances and were used in the nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination plot. The permutational analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) model was used for testing the null hypothesis of no difference between the compared groups[2], based on the parameters\u2019 permutation of residuals under a reduced model and a type III sum of squares. PERMDISP was used to assess the dispersion of the microbial community within the groups[2]. Microbial differences between groups at the taxonomic level were tested for statistical significance based on the Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests using GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, USA). The LEfSe algorithm was performed using the Galaxy application tool (http://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/galaxy/) with a linear discriminant analysis cutoff score of 3.0 and a P of <0.05 for statistical significance[3]. Functional predictions of microbial community were performed using PICRUSt on closed-reference OTUs with 97% identity based on the Greengenes database (v13.5)[4]. The OTUs were normalized on PICRUSt and used for the prediction of KEGG orthologs (KOs). The predicted metagenome was statistically analyzed on STAMP using Welch\u2019s t test with the Benjamini-Hochberg correction for the false-discovery rate (FDR) and filtered to retain features with an effect size (ratio of proportions) of greater than 2[5]. A heatmap was generated using the ggplots2 package (v2.0.0), and a dendrogram of bacterial taxa was generated based on the Bray-Curtis distances and hierarchical clustering performed using Ward\u2019s method[6][7]. 2 and 3 mice, respectively, were excluded from the microbiota and metabolome analysis, as samples from them failed quality control thresholds.\n</p>\nFor analysis of the metabolome data, cross-validation was performed. 75% of the samples were used as a training set, and the remaining 25% were used as a test set, ensuring that the number of samples in the test set was proportional to the total number of samples from each class and that at least 1 sample from each class was present in the test set. To choose the number of components for the model, a leave-one-out cross-validation step was carried out on the samples in the training set, and the F1 was used to choose the number of components, with the additional constraint that a maximum of 8 components was used. A double cross-validation was repeated 2,000 times for each group with randomly chosen samples in the training and test sets to prevent bias due to the choice of training or test set.\n</p>\nThis procedure was repeated with randomly generated class assignments to provide a reference value for Q2. The chosen number of components minus 1 was then used as an OPLS filter, and a PLS-DA with 2 components was carried out on the filtered data to yield 1 predictive and 1 orthogonal component. In the back-scaled loadings analysis, peaks that allow the models to distinguish between classes were assigned by comparing chemical-shift values and multiplicities from J-resolved NMR spectra to values from the BMRB[8], HMDB[9], and Chenomx software. Volcano plots were generated in R. 5 samples were excluded from the metabolome analysis, as these samples failed quality control thresholds. Microbiota and metabolome associations based on Spearman\u2019s correlation were performed in R using the corrplot package. Bacterial taxa and metabolites were sorted according to hierarchical clustering based on Euclidean distances, and Ward\u2019s method was used to perform cluster analysis.\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Hammer O, Harper DAT, Ryan PD. 2001.
