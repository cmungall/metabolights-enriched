These species include the cosmopolitan diatom <em>Chaetoceros affinis</em> CCMP159 (isolated from Great South Bay, NY, USA, 1958), the haptophytes<em> Chrysochromulina polylepis </em>CCMP1757 (isolated from the North Sea 1988) and <em>Gephyrocapsa oceanica</em> RCC1303 (isolated from Arachon Bay, France, Jan 1999), and the raphidophyte <em>Heterosigma akashiwo </em>strain CCMP 2393 (isolated from Rehoboth Bay, Delaware, USA). Cultures were grown under three conditions: nitrogen-stress, phosphorus-stress, and replete conditions. Intracellular metabolites were extracted from cultures and analyzed with targeted and untargeted mass spectrometry-based metabolomics methods.</p>",

These species include the cosmopolitan diatom Chaetoceros affinis CCMP159 (isolated from Great South Bay, NY, USA, 1958), the haptophytes Chrysochromulina polylepis CCMP1757 (isolated from the North Sea 1988) and Gephyrocapsa oceanica RCC1303 (isolated from Arachon Bay, France, Jan 1999), and the raphidophyte Heterosigma akashiwo strain CCMP 2393 (isolated from Rehoboth Bay, Delaware, USA). All species with the exception of G. oceanica were cultured in modified L1 medium made with autoclaved 0.2-\u03bcm filtered seawater from Vineyard Sound, MA with the following nitrogen to phosphorus ratio: replete (576 mM NaNO3, 36.2 mM NaH2PO4), N-stress (5 \u00b5M NaNO3 and 36.2 \u00b5M NaH2PO4), and P-stress (5 \u00b5M NaNO3 and 0.2 \u00b5M NaH2PO4). G. oceanica was cultured at the following nitrogen to phosphorus ratio: replete (100 \u00b5M NaNO3 and 6 \u00b5M NaH2PO4), N-stress (1 \u00b5M NaNO3 and 6 \u00b5M NaH2PO4), and P-stress (100 \u00b5M NaNO3 and no added NaH2PO4). The lower nutrient concentrations for G. oceanica are necessary to ensure consistent calcification. Each culture was grown with light intensity of 100 \u03bcmol quanta/m^2/s of photosynthetically active radiation (400-700 nm) during a 14 h:10 h light:dark cycle and temperature varied by species (according to species-specific temperature preferences) with C. affinis, G. oceanica, and H. akashiwo grown at 18 \u00b0C, and C. polylepis grown at 15 \u00b0C. Some cultures were continuously rotated on an orbital shaker (H. akashiwo, 75 rpm; C. affinis, 100 rpm; C. polylepis, 100 rpm) to maintain optimal growth. Cultures were not axenic, but were uni-algal and uni-eukaryotic.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Experimental Design:</strong></p><p>Entrainment cultures were used to initiate experimental cultures to decrease carryover of nutrients from stock cultures and promote acclimation to the experimental conditions. Single entrainment cultures (~100 ml) were grown in modified L1 medium (base seawater as above) under the following nitrogen to phosphorus ratios: replete (samples with 'R' in sample names, 576 \u00b5M NaNO3 and 36.2 \u00b5M NaH2PO4), N-stress (samples with 'N' in sample names, 5 \u00b5M NaNO3 and 36.2 \u00b5M NaH2PO4), and P-stress (cells with 'P' in sample names, 5 \u00b5M NaNO3 and 0.2 \u00b5M NaH2PO4). Entrainment cultures were kept at 18 \u00b0C on a 14 h:10 h light:dark cycle (as above) with gentle rotation (75 rpm) for 3 d. We initiated experiments by inoculating triplicate 1-L flasks (containing 0.3 L media) for each treatment with 30 ml of the corresponding entrainment culture and maintained the replicate flasks under the same conditions as the entrainment cultures.</p><p><br></p><p>Growth was monitored in each flask by in vivo chlorophyll fluorescence on a Turner Designs Aquafluor handheld fluorometer with paired cell counts. Cell count samples were preserved in 2% (final concentration) acid Lugol's solution and cell concentrations were determined by microscopic counts. Measurements were recorded at the same time each day (during the middle of the light phase) to avoid diel changes in metabolite synthesis. Replete cultures were harvested in exponential phase, and harvested N-stress and P-stress cultures once growth rates and cell yields were reduced relative to the replete control, in agreement with the definition of nutrient stress rather than deficiency<strong>[1]</strong>. Filtered cells (300 ml) of each replicate in each treatment were filtered onto combusted 47 mm GF/Fs (Whatman) using combusted glass filtration funnels under low vacuum pressure (never exceeding 5 mm Hg) to collect particulate metabolite samples. Filters were flash-frozen in cryovials in liquid nitrogen and then stored -80 \u00b0C until extraction.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> MacIntyre HL, JJ Cullen. 2005 Using cultures to investigate the physiological ecology of microalgae.</p><p>In R.A.

The extraction procedure for <strong>untargeted</strong> and <strong>targeted</strong> samples was identical with the exception of the final solid phase extraction (<strong>see below</strong>). For both types of analyses, each filter was first cut into 6 roughly equivalent pieces which were then weighed. The weight was used to determine the fraction of the obtained filtered volume for each sample. The filter pieces were placed within an 8 ml amber glass vial. Metabolites were extracted from filters using cold 40:40:20 acetonitrile:methanol:water+0.1 M formic acid similar to previous work<strong>[1]</strong>. 25 \u00b5l of 1 \u00b5g/ml deuterated standard mix (d3-glutamic acid, d4-4-hydroxybenzoic acid, and d5-taurocholate) was then added as extraction recovery standards. The solvent-filter mixture was sonicated for 10 min to lyse the cells, and the solvent was then transferred into a microcentrifuge tube. The filters were rinsed with 3 x 200 \u00b5l aliquots of extraction solvent to capture any remaining organic matter. The combined extracts were centrifuged at 20,000 x g for 5 min, and the supernatant carefully decanted into new 8 ml amber glass vials to leave behind any scraps of filter or cellular detritus. The solvents were neutralized with 25.6 \u03bcl of 6 M ammonium hydroxide and subsequently dried down in a vacufuge. For <strong>targeted</strong> analysis, dried samples were neutralized in 95:5 water:acetonitrile solution plus 2.5 \u03bcl of 5 \u03bcg/ml deuterated standard mix.</p><p><br></p><p>Due to the sensitivity of <strong>untargeted</strong> analyses to high salt concentrations, <strong>solid-phase extraction</strong> was used as an additional desalting step. These samples were reconstituted with 500 \u03bcl of 0.05 \u03bcg/ml biotin D2 with 0.01 M HCl to lower the pH to 2 and ran these samples through 100 mg of 1 ml\u00adAgilent Bond Elut PPL cartridges. The cartridge was pre-conditioned with 1 bed-volume of 100% methanol. Acidified <strong>untargeted</strong> samples were run through the cartridge at a flow rate no greater than 40 ml/min. The cartridges were rinsed with 1 bed-volume of 0.01 M HCl, then dried down for 5 min, and the metabolites eluted with 8 ml of methanol. <strong>Untargeted</strong> samples were dried again and brought up to 250 \u00b5L with 95:5 water:acetonitrile in new vials plus 2.5 \u00b5l of 5 \u00b5g/ml deuterated standard mix. 45 \u00b5l from each sample was combined to create a pooled sample.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Rabinowitz JD, Kimball E.

Features were defined as peaks with unique mass to charge (m/z) and retention time values, with relative abundances determined by their area. Processed data was subjected to quality control filtering by removing possible contaminants and non-reproducible features as described previously<strong>[5]</strong>. Briefly, features observed within blanks, features with a coefficient of variation higher than 0.2 within pooled samples, and features with low reproducibility across factor groups were removed. From <strong>day 3</strong>, metabolite concentrations normalized by the cell counts were reported.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>MAVEN</strong> was used to integrate compound peak areas within <strong>targeted</strong> data<strong>[6]</strong>. An in-house <strong>MATLAB</strong> script was used to apply quality control filtering and to quantify peak areas using a standard curve made up of 4 to 10 points. Metabolites were retained for this analysis if <strong>(1)</strong> the peak included a confirm ion, and <strong>(2)</strong> the metabolite was present within 2 out of 3 biological replicates of each treatment. The list was further culled by correcting for metabolite presence in procedural blanks. Compound ion suppression was estimated as the intensity ratio between a 500 ng/ml standard mix dissolved in Milli-Q water and the matching standard mix dissolved in pooled sample matrix.
