                "description": "<p>NAMPT plays a major role in NAD biosynthesis in many cancers and is an attractive potential cancer target. However, factors dictating therapeutic efficacy of NAMPT inhibitors (NAMPTi) are unclear. We report that neuroendocrine phenotypes predict lung and prostate carcinoma vulnerability to NAMPTi, and that NAMPTi therapy against those cancers is enhanced by dietary modification. Neuroendocrine differentiation of tumor cells was associated with down-regulation of genes relevant to QPRT-dependent de novo NAD synthesis, promoting NAMPTi susceptibility in vitro. We also found that circulating nicotinic acid riboside (NAR), a non-canonical niacin absent in culture media, antagonizes NAMPTi efficacy as it fuels NAMPT-independent but NMRK1-dependent NAD synthesis in tumors. In mouse transplantation models, depleting blood NAR by nutritional or genetic manipulations was synthetic lethal to tumors when combined with NAMPTi. Our findings provide a rationale for simultaneous targeting of NAR metabolism and NAMPT therapeutically in neuroendocrine carcinoma.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Mouse NAMPT targeted therapy</strong> is reported in the current study&nbsp;<a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS7252' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS7252</strong></a>.</p><p><strong>Cell NAMPTi treatment </strong>is reported in <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS7251' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS7251</strong></a>.</p><p><strong>Mouse NAD targeted time-course</strong>&nbsp;is reported in&nbsp;<a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS7253' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS7253</strong></a>.</p>",

Mice were maintained in specific pathogen-free (SPF) facilities with a 12-h light-dark cycle. Unless stated, mice were fed a normal diet (MF from Oriental Yeast Co., LTD; Tokyo, Japan) ad libitum.</p><p><br></p><p>Xenografts made using human cell lines were generated by s.c. inoculation of NOG mice with 1 x 10^6 cells plus Matrigel per site. Tumor length and width were measured by calipers, and volume was calculated based on the standard formula: (length x width2)/2. GNE-617 was dissolved at 3 mg/mL in PEG400/H2O/EtOH (6:3:1) solution by sonication, and dosed at 0.2 mL/mouse by gavage once a day at 12 p.m. for 4 consecutive days. 445 TLM-118 was dissolved at 6 mg/mL in Cremophor/EtOH/PBS (1:1:4) solution by sonication, and administered intraperitoneally at 0.1 mL/mouse twice a day at 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. for 4 consecutive days. For NAR administration, NAR (10 mg/0.1 mL PBS) or control PBS alone was intraperitoneally injected at the time of GNE-617 dosing. Unless otherwise specified, tumor tissues were isolated at 3 p.m. the day after GNE-617 dosing.</p><p><br></p><p>In NA administration experiments, mice fed a NFD (see Method Details) for 3 days were then administered 4 mg NA/0.2 mL PBS by gavage at 9 a.m. on day 4. Blood samples were collected over time for up to 6 h after administration. For tracer experiments, [D4]-NA was administered by gavage and blood samples were collected at 1 and 3 h afterwards.</p><p><br></p><p>Naprt flox mice were generated by standard gene-targeting methods in mouse ES cells (on a C57/BL6 background). Obtained F1 offspring (male) were backcrossed to C57/BL6JclN female mice, and further crossed with CAG-Cre mice to produce mice carrying the Naprt- allele (in which Naprt exons 2-13 are deleted). Mice were then crossed with a Rag1-KO line to obtain double mutants. Naprt+/-; Rag1-/- male and female mice were mated and resulting NaprtWT; Rag1 -/- and Naprt-/-; Rag -/- littermates were used in experiments. In transplantation experiments, only female mice were used.</p><p><br></p><p>The niacin-free diet (NFD) and a series of niacin-supplemented NFDs were produced and sterilized at Oriental Yeast Co., LTD. Synthetic diets were composed of 25% vitamin-free casein, 38% corn starch, 10% a-corn starch, 5% granulated sugar, 6% soybean oil, 8% cellulose, and a 6% mineral and 2% vitamin solution either containing or not containing niacin. Formulation of the vitamin mix was as follows (provided are amounts per 100 g vitamin mix): 0.15385 g vitamin A acetate (325 IU/mg), 0.1 g vitamin D3 (100 IU/mg), 1 g vitamin E (50%), 0.52 g vitamin K3, 0.12 g vitamin B1, 0.4 g vitamin B2, 0.08 g vitamin B6, 0.05 g vitamin B12 (0.1%), 2 mg biotin, 20 mg folate, 0.5 g Calcium (+)-pantothenate, 0.6 g inositol, 0.5 g 4-aminobenzoic acid, 20 g choline chloride, 3 g vitamin C and 72.95415 g cellulose. The W (tryptophan)-free diet (WFD) was purchased from Research Diets Inc (New Brunswick, NJ). Niacin equivalent content of diets was determined by a standard bioassay using Lactobacillus plantarum ATCC-8014 at Japan Food Research Laboratories (Tokyo, Japan). The content of each niacin isoform contained in diets was determined by LC-MS analysis at the Foundation for Promotion of Material Science and Technology of Japan (Tokyo, Japan).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Metabolite measurement by mass spectrometry</strong></p><p>Mice bearing Lu-139 tumors were fed a normal diet or a NFD for 3 days and then treated with GNE-617 once a day for 4 more days. Tumor tissue samples were collected on day 7, washed with PBS and snap-frozen immediately after resection. Extraction and measurement of metabolites were performed using either a capillary electrophoresis (CE)-mass spectrometry (MS) system or Liquid Chromatograph (LC)-MS, as described previously<strong>[1][2]</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Morita M, Sato T, Nomura M, Sakamoto Y, Inoue Y, Tanaka R, Ito S, Kurosawa K, Yamaguchi K, Sugiura Y, Takizaki H, Yamashita Y, Katakura R, Sato I, Kawai M, Okada Y, Watanabe H, Kondoh G, Matsumoto S, Kishimoto A, Obata M, Matsumoto M, Fukuhara T, Motohashi H, Suematsu M, Komatsu M, Nakayama KI, Watanabe T, Soga T, Shima H, Maemondo M, Tanuma N.
