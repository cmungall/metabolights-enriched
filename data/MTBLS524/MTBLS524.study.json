                "title": "Identification of a discriminative metabolomic fingerprint of potential clinical relevance in saliva of patients with periodontitis using 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy",
                "description": "Periodontitis is characterized by the loss of the supporting tissues of the teeth in an inflammatory-infectious context. The diagnosis relies on clinical and X-ray examination. Unfortunately, clinical signs of tissue destruction occur late in the disease progression. Therefore, it is mandatory to identify reliable biomarkers to facilitate a better and earlier management of this disease. To this end, saliva represents a promising fluid for identification of biomarkers as metabolomic fingerprints. The present study used high-resolution 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy coupled with multivariate statistical analysis to identify the metabolic signature of active periodontitis. The metabolome of stimulated saliva of 26 patients with generalized periodontitis (18 chronic and 8 aggressive) was compared to that of 25 healthy controls. Principal Components Analysis (PCA), performed with clinical variables, indicated that the patient population was homogeneous, demonstrating a strong correlation between the clinical and the radiological variables used to assess the loss of periodontal tissues and criteria of active disease. Orthogonal Projection to Latent Structure (OPLS) analysis showed that patients with periodontitis can be discriminated from controls on the basis of metabolite concentrations in saliva with satisfactory explained variance (R2X = 0.81 and R2Y = 0.61) and predictability (Q2Y = 0.49, CV-AUROC = 0.94). Interestingly, this discrimination was irrespective of the type of generalized periodontitis, i.e. chronic or aggressive. Among the main discriminating metabolites were short chain fatty acids as butyrate, observed in higher concentrations, and lactate, gamma-amino-butyrate, methanol, and threonine observed in lower concentrations in periodontitis. The association of lactate, GABA, and butyrate to generate an aggregated variable reached the best positive predictive value for diagnosis of periodontitis. In conclusion, this pilot study showed that 1H-NMR spectroscopy analysis of saliva could differentiate patients with periodontitis from controls. Therefore, this simple, robust, non-invasive method, may offer a significant help for early diagnosis and follow-up of periodontitis.",

The diagnostic criteria for chronic and aggressive generalized periodontitis were defined according to the classification proposed at the International Workshop for the Classification of Periodontal Diseases and Conditions in 1999 [38]. Healthy controls (n = 26) were simultaneously recruited from dental students or medical staff and were matched by age (\u00b1 5 years), gender, and smoking habits. Both patient and control groups were balanced for ethnicity and socio-economic levels.\n</p>\nThe collection of saliva was done under standardized conditions, between 09:00 and 11:00 am after paraffin wax-stimulation and to prevent blood contamination, before the assessment of clinical parameters. A volume of 10 ml saliva was collected (\u00b15 min), the pH was recorded and the sample immediately stored at -25 \u00b0C. Patients and controls were required to refrain from eating, drinking, chewing gum, and tooth brushing for at least 2 h prior to the sample collection.\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Armitage GC.

Spectra were phased and a multipoint linear baseline correction was applied. Each spectrum was referenced using a propionic acid signal (1.04 ppm). The spectral region between 0\u20139 ppm was divided into 9000 spectral regions of 0.001 ppm width, called buckets, using in-house C code. The water region was excluded [5.1; 4.3 ppm]. The icoshift tool for Matlab (Matlab\u00ae 2014, The Mathworks Inc., Natick, MA, USA) was used for realignment[1]. Each bucket was integrated and scaled using probabilistic quotient normalization[2].\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Savorani F1, Tomasi G, Engelsen SB. icoshift: A versatile tool for the rapid alignment of 1D NMR spectra.
