                "description": "<p><strong>AIM:</strong> The role of lipids in periodontitis has not been well studied. Thus, this study aimed to explore periodontitis-associated lipid profile changes and identify differentially expressed lipid metabolites in gingival tissues.</p><p><strong>MATERIALS AND METHODS:</strong> Gingival tissues from 38 patients with periodontitis (periodontitis group) and 38 periodontally healthy individuals (control group) were collected. A UHPLC-QTOF-MS-based non-targeted metabolomics platform was used to identify and compare the lipid profiles of the two groups. The distribution and expression of related proteins were subsequently analyzed via immunohistochemistry to further validate the identified lipids.</p><p><strong>RESULTS:</strong> Lipid profiles significantly differed between the two groups, and 20 differentially expressed lipid species were identified. Lysophosphatidylcholines (lysoPCs), diacylglycerols (DGs) and phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs) were significantly upregulated, while triacylglycerols (TGs) were downregulated in the periodontitis group. Moreover, the staining intensity of ABHD5/CGI-58, secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2), and sPLA2-IIA was significantly stronger in the gingival tissues of patients with periodontitis than in those of healthy controls.</p><p><strong>CONCLUSIONS:</strong> LysoPCs, DGs, and PEs were significantly upregulated, whereas TGs were downregulated in gingival tissues of patients with periodontitis. Correspondingly, the immunohistochemical staining of ABHD5/CGI-58, sPLA2 and sPLA2-IIA in gingival tissues was consistent with the downstream production of lipid classes (lysoPCs, TGs and DGs).</p>",

The pressures of nebulizer gas (GS1), heater gas (GS2) and curtain gas (CUR) were set to 60, 60 and 30 psi, respectively. Ionization voltage (ISVF) was set to 5000 V and spray temperature was 600 \u00b0C. A typical <strong>Information Dependent Acquisition</strong> (<strong>IDA</strong>) comprising the acquisition of a survey TOF MS spectrum and then a MS/MS experiment was applied in the analysis. The TOF MS scan was operated under the high resolution settings with a range of 60-1000 m/z and an accumulation time of 200 ms. The declustering potential (DP) and collision energy (CE) were set at 100 V and 10 eV, respectively, in the positive ion mode. In the second experiment, up to 6 candidate precursors per scan cycle were fragmented in collision-induced dissociation (CID) by a CE setting at 45 eV, and the data were collected at a range of 25-1000 m/z with 50 ms accumulation time for the products of each precursor.
