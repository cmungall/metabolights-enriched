                "description": "<p><strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong>&nbsp;COVID-19 has become a global impediment by bringing everything to a halt starting from January 2020. India underwent the lockdown starting from 22nd March 2020 with the sudden spike in the number of COVID-19 patients in major cities and states. This study focused on how metabolites play a crucial role in SARSCoV-2 prognosis.</p><p><strong>MATERIALS AND METHODS:</strong> Metabolome profiling of 106 plasma samples and 24 swab samples from symptomatic patients in the Indian population of the Mumbai region was done. COVID-19 positive samples were further segregated under the non-severe COVID-19 and severe COVID-19 patient cohort for both plasma and swab.</p><p><strong>RESULTS:</strong>&nbsp;After analyzing the raw files, total 7,949 and 12,871 metabolites in plasma and swab were found. 11 and 35 significantly altered metabolites were found in COVID-19 positive compared to COVID-19 negative plasma and swab samples, respectively. Also, 9 and 23 significantly altered metabolites were found in severe COVID-19 positive to non-severe COVID-19 positive plasma and swab samples, respectively. The majorly affected pathways in COVID-19 patients were found to be the amino acid metabolism pathway, sphingosine metabolism pathway, and bile salt metabolism pathway.</p><p><strong>CONCLUSION:</strong>&nbsp;This study facilitates identification of potential metabolite-based biomarker candidates for rapid diagnosis and prognosis for clinical applications.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Blood plasma assay</strong> is reported in the current study <strong>MTBLS2291</strong>.</p><p><strong>Nasopharyngeal swab assay</strong> is reported in <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS2349' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS2349</strong></a>.</p>",

In total, 106 plasma samples were processed for metabolome profiling. The study cohort included plasma samples from 31 patients with <strong>COVID-19(-)</strong> patients, 43 <strong>NSC</strong> patients, and 29 samples from <strong>SC</strong> patients.

Leftover blood (~1 ml) was collected and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min to separate plasma. The separated plasma was then incubated at 56 \u00b0C for 30 min for viral inactivation and further stored at -80 \u00b0C in cryovials until further processing. Around 100 \u03bcl of plasma separated from the leftover blood sample was dispensed into a sterile tube, and 200 \u03bcl of pre-chilled absolute ethanol was added to the plasma sample.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Bankar R, Suvarna K, Ghantasala S, Banerjee A, Biswas D, Choudhury M, Palanivel V, Salkar A, Verma A, Singh A, Mukherjee A, Pai MGJ, Roy J, Srivastava A, Badaya A, Agrawal S, Shrivastav O, Shastri J, Srivastava S.

For compound detection signal to noise ratio (S/N) was kept as 3, and the minimum peak intensity was 10^6. To assign compound annotation on MS/MS level, 3 different data sources, such as <strong>mzCloud</strong>, <strong>ChemSpider</strong>, and <strong>Metabolika</strong>, with a mass tolerance of 5 ppm, were used<strong>[1</strong>].

Spearman correlation analysis of each cohort and all the samples was performed to check the data quality, and the samples having <strong>R2</strong> above 0.5 were considered for further post-processing. Also, the CV of the internal standard was checked across the set of samples and individual samples. The samples passing CV% &lt;30 for internal standards were only used in the data analysis. The features with over 30% missing values were filtered out, and the missing value imputation was done separately for each cohort through KNN (k-nearest neighboring) in <strong>Metaboanalyst 4.0[2][3]</strong>. The data was then log-transformed and median normalized, which was followed by a 2-tailed unpaired student t-test for each pair of cohorts. The compounds having FDR adjusted p-value less than 0.05 and log2 fold change above 1.5 were considered statistically differentially expressed metabolites.

The unannotated metabolites from the list was taken and mapped on the blood exposome database. The basis of mapping exposomes was the molecular formula, which was the common parameter between the raw files and the blood exposome database. The compounds with redundant chemical formulas were removed from the database to avoid ambiguity, which lead to loss of data. Once the exposomes were discovered for each cohort of patients, then comparative analysis was done for the groups: <strong>COVID-19(+)</strong> vs. <strong>COVID-19(-)</strong>, and <strong>NSC</strong> vs. <strong>SC</strong>.

Relevant literatures were obtained from <strong>PubChem</strong>, <strong>PubMed</strong>, <strong>blood exposome database</strong>, <strong>US environmental protection agency website</strong> and <strong>DrugBank</strong> online.
