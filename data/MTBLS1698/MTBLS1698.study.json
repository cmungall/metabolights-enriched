                "description": "<p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> Dietary intervention has been reported to improve intestinal health. The intestinal microbiota of newborn animals plays a fundamental role in the development of intestinal function and the innate immune system. However, little is currently known about dietary interventions in the gut microbiota and barrier function of livestock, especially suckling Bamei piglets. To this end, we studied the effect of early dietary supplementation on intestinal bacterial communities and intestinal barrier function in piglets.</p><p><strong>RESULTS:</strong> 10 purebred Bamei sows were randomly allocated into two groups. In group one, the piglets received a supplementary milk replacer on day 7 of age, whereas the other control group was allowed sow\u2019s milk alone. At 21 days, 18 and 17, respectively, piglets in each group of average weight were randomly selected and sacrificed. Tissue and digesta samples were collected from the jejunum to evaluate differences in the microbiome-metabolome and the mRNA expression of inflammatory cytokines (TLR4, TNF\u03b1 and IL-8) and barrier proteins (ZO-1, Occludin and Claudin-1). Sequencing of 16S rRNA revealed that ES improved the gut microbiome composition of Bamei suckling piglets. The relative abundances of some bacterial species such as Lactobacillales, Romboutsia, Actinobacillus, Bacteroides were significantly reduced in the ES group. Metabolomics analysis indicated that 23 compounds were enriched and 35 compounds decreased in the ES group. And correlation analysis demonstrated that some gut bacterial genera were highly correlated with altered gut microbiota-related metabolites. Meanwhile, ES of Bamei suckling piglets altered the gene expression of inflammatory cytokine and barrier protein in the jejunum.</p><p><strong>CONCLUSIONS:</strong> In summary, these results provide important insights on the relationships between jejunal microbiota and related metabolites, and jejunal barrier function during the early life of Bamei suckling piglets.</p>",

The quality control (QC) samples were prepared similarly. For the UHPLC-Q-TOF/MS analysis, the samples were re-dissolved in 100 \u03bcl acetonitrile/water (1:1, v/v) solvent. To monitor the stability and repeatability of instrument analysis, QC samples were prepared by pooling 10 \u03bcl of each sample and these were analyzed together with the other samples. The QC samples were inserted regularly and analyzed per every 10 samples.</p>",

Principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) were performed for both positive and negative models after log transformation and Pareto-scaling. The variable importance in the projection (VIP) value of each variable in the PLS-DA model was calculated to indicate its contribution to the classification. Metabolites with a VIP value &gt;1 were further analyzed with a Student\u2019s t-test at univariate level to measure the significance of each metabolite. P values &lt;0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. Metabolic pathway enrichment analysis was performed using the OmicShare tools, a free online platform for data analysis (<a href='http://www.omicshare.com/tools' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>http://www.omicshare.com/tools</a>).</p>",
