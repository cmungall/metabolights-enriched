                "description": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a major risk factor leading to chronic liver disease and type 2 diabetes. Here we chart liver metabolic activity and functionality in NAFLD by integrating global transcriptomic data, from human liver biopsies, and metabolic flux data, measured across the human splanchnic vascular bed, within a genome-scale model of human metabolism. We show that an increased amount of liver fat induces mitochondrial metabolism, lipolysis, glyceroneogenesis and a switch from lactate to glycerol as substrate for gluconeogenesis, indicating an intricate balance of exacerbated opposite metabolic processes in glycemic regulation. These changes were associated with reduced metabolic adaptability on a network level in the sense that liver fat accumulation puts increasing demands on the liver to adaptively regulate metabolic responses to maintain basic liver functions. We propose that failure to meet excessive metabolic challenges coupled with reduced metabolic adaptability may lead to a vicious pathogenic cycle leading to the co-morbidities of NAFLD.",

Shortly, the first was inserted in an antecubital vein for infusions of saline (first 90 min), glucose, insulin, and potassium-[2,2-2H2]palmitate, the second was inserted in a contralateral arm and the third catheter was inserted percutaneously under local anaesthesia into a femoral vein. Hepatic blood flow was measured using a constant i.v. infusion of indocyanine green (ICG). Plasma glucose was maintained at 5 mmol/liter (90 mg/dl) until 240 min using a variable rate infusion of 20% glucose. Potassium-[2,2-2H2]palmitate bound to human albumin was infused at a rate of 0.05 \u00b5mol/kg/min starting at 30 min to trace FFA and TG metabolism in vivo. Hepatic blood flow was measured at 90, 100, 110, 120, 200, 220, 240 min. During the saline and insulin infusion, arterialized and hepatic vein plasma samples were taken at 10-60 min intervals.\n</p>\nThe fat content of the liver biopsy specimens (% of hepatocytes with macrovesicular steatosis) was determined by an experienced liver pathologist in a blinded fashion. The % of macrovesicular steatosis was used as the liver fat %.",

                        "description": "Data transformation\nThe original GC\u00d7GC-TOFMS data included retention times, retention indices (RI), spectral information, possible identification, spectral similarity value (S=0-1000) and peak response data. The linear retention indexes were calculated based on the retention times of the compounds and the retention times of the retention index standards (n-alkanes). The data were transferred into an in-house developed program Guineu25. The alignment of the data was done based on the two retention times and spectra. After alignment of the GC\u00d7GC-TOFMS data, two filtration criteria were used for positive identification: 1) spectral match < 850 and 2) the RIexp-RIlit  < 25 or RIexp-RIstd_exp < 25, in which RIexp is the experimental RI for a compound and RIlit  is the literature value for the identified compound and RIstd_exp is the experimental RI value for a standard compound. Compounds not fulfilling the criteria were renamed to unknowns and were subjected to further identification.\n</p>\nCalibration curves (six points, c=15-2000 ng, cholesterol c=170-6000 ng) were constructed for the following compounds: pyruvic acid, alanine, 3-hydroxybutyric acid, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, glycine, succinic acid, fumaric acid, serine, threonine, malic acid, methionine, aspartic acid, alpha-ketoglutaric acid, phenylalanine, glutamic acid, ornithine, citric acid, tyrosine, palmitic acid, linoleic acid, oleic acid, stearic acid, arachidonic acid, and  cholesterol.",
