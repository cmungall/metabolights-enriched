                "description": "<p>Maternal folic acid intake is crucial for the development of the offspring's nervous system, and folic acid metabolism disorders during pregnancy lead to neural tube defects (NTDs) in the fetus. Folic acid and vitamins biosynthesis is a major biochemical feature of gut microbiota. The complex and diverse microbial ecosystem residing within maternal host contributes critically to these intergenerational impacts. However, the mechanisms still require further investigation. In this study, we found that the low folate diets combined MTX-induced changed the structure/composition of the gut microbiota and substantially altered the fecal metabolic phenotype of pregnant mice, including central carbon metabolism in cancer and vitamin digestion &amp; absorption. We demonstrated that the correlation betweent gut microbiota of pregnant mice and the brain metabolic profiles of NTDs fetal mice. According to our data, the Lactobacillales and Bifidobacteriales abundances in pregnant mice gut were positively correlated with the abundances of lipid metabolites in fetal mice brain. The abundances of Enterobacterales and Clostridiales were negatively correlated with those lipid metabolites. Interestingly, the abundance of Inosine, Uridine, L-Carnitine and Glycerophosphocholine were down-regulated synchronously in pregnant feces and NTDs fetal mice brain. This was probably the intergenerational microbial-metabolism biomarkers of NTDs. Our study provides evidence for how perinatal microecological factors shape fetal neural tube development.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Feces metabolomics</strong>&nbsp;is reported in the current study&nbsp;<a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS4893' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS4893</strong></a>.</p><p><strong>Brain tissue metabolomics</strong>&nbsp;is reported in&nbsp;<a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS4894' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS4894</strong></a>.</p>",

                        "description": "<p><strong>LC-MS:</strong></p><p>The original LC-MS data were processed by software <strong>Progenesis QI</strong> v2.3 (Nonlinear, Dynamics, Newcastle, UK) for baseline filtering, peak identification, integral, retention time correction, peak alignment and normalization. Main parameters of 5 ppm precursor tolerance, 10 ppm product tolerance and 5% product ion threshold were applied. Compound identification were based on precise mass-to-charge ratio (m/z), secondary fragments and isotopic distribution using The <strong>Human Metabolome Database</strong> (<strong>HMDB</strong>), <strong>LIPIDMAPS</strong> (v2.3), <strong>METLIN</strong> and self-built databases to do qualitative analysis. The extracted data were then further processed by removing any peaks with a missing value (ion intensity = 0) in more than 50% in groups, by replacing zero value by half of the minimum value, and by screening according to the qualitative results of the compound. Compounds with resulting scores below 36 (out of 60) points were also deemed to be inaccurate and removed. A data matrix was combined from the positive and negative ion data. The matrix was imported in <strong>R</strong> to carry out Principle Component Analysis (PCA) to observe the overall distribution among the samples and the stability of the whole analysis process. Orthogonal Partial Least-Squares-Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA) and Partial Least-Squares-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) were utilized to distinguish the metabolites that differ between groups. To prevent overfitting, 7-fold cross-validation and 200 Response Permutation Testing (RPT) were used to evaluate the quality of the model. Variable Importance of Projection (VIP) values obtained from the OPLS-DA model were used to rank the overall contribution of each variable to group discrimination. A two-tailed Student\u2019s T-test was further used to verify whether the metabolites of difference between groups were significant. Differential metabolites were selected with VIP values greater than 1.0 and p-values less than 0.05.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>GC-MS:</strong></p><p>The obtained raw data in .<strong>D</strong> format were transferred to .<strong>abf</strong> format via software <strong>Analysis Base File Converter</strong> for quick retrieval of data. Data were imported into software <strong>MS-DIAL</strong>, which performs peak detection, peak identification, MS2Dec deconvolution, characterization, peak alignment, wave filtering and missing value interpolation. Metabolite characterization is based on <strong>LUG</strong> database. A data matrix was derived. The three-dimensional matrix includes: sample information, the name of the peak of each substance, retention time, retention index, mass-to-charge ratio and signal intensity. In each sample, all peak signal intensities were segmented and normalized according to the internal standards with RSD less than 0.3 after screening. After the data was normalized, redundancy removal and peak merging were conducted to obtain the data matrix.
