                "description": "<p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> The coevolution and interaction between plants and microorganisms have long been a subject of significant research interest. Dark septate endophytes (DSE) have garnered great attention in contemporary research due to their functional diversity, in vitro cultivation ability, and ability to establish symbiotic associations with host plants. In the present study, three DSE strains, namely <em>Acrocalymma vagum</em>, <em>Zopfiella marina</em>, and <em>Phoma herbarum</em>, which were obtained from the roots of <em>Astragalus membranaceus</em>, were introduced into maize plants through inoculation. We evaluated the effects of DSE inoculation on maize growth and root secretion activity through a multi omics methods, and proposed mechanisms for 'internal pathways' and 'external pathways'.</p><p><strong>RESULTS:</strong> The findings indicated that A. vagum exhibited superior growth-promoting ability on maize compared to <em>Z. marina</em> and <em>P. herbarum</em>.GO and KEGG enrichment analysis found that <em>A. vagum</em> inoculation resulted in significant enrichment of differentially expressed genes in annotation functions related to hormone regulation and lipid metabolism. A. vagum inoculation revealed that the gene pathways involved in plant hormone signaling and plant pathogen interactions play a crucial role in promoting host growth, and <em>A. vagum</em> inoculation group exhibited the highest number of differentially expressed genes, the most intricate protein-protein interaction (PPI) model, and the most pronounced relationship between differentially expressed genes. After the inoculation of <em>A.vagum</em>, the levels of salicylic acid, zeatin, and IAA in maize plants significantly increased. Additionally, the diversity and abundance of endophytic fungi, as well as the proportion of harmful bacteria and beneficial fungi, had significantly increased. Compared with <em>Z. marina</em> and <em>P. herbarum</em>, the net photosynthetic rate (Pn) and stomatal conductance (Gs) of <em>A.vagum</em> inoculated plants significantly increased. Inoculation with <em>A.vagum</em> could enhance the ability of corn roots to secrete lipids, sugars, and amino acids, resulted in a notable augmentation of beneficial bacteria and fungi, accompanied by a significant reduction in the proportion of harmful bacteria in the rhizosphere soil, such as <em>Fusarium solani</em> and <em>Fusarium lacertarum</em>, exhibited significant inhibition, whereas <em>Bacillus niabensis</em> and <em>Bacillus nealsonii</em> demonstrated enrichment trends. Soil pH, organic matter, available potassium content, acid phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase and urease activity exhibited significant increases following the inoculation of <em>A. vagum</em>. Variance decomposition and structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis indicated that the 'internal pathway', maize growth is mainly influenced by the interaction of endogenous hormones, endophytic microorganisms, and photosynthetic parameters, whereas within the 'external pathway', the interaction between soil microorganisms and soil physicochemical properties exerted a dominant influence. Compared with the <em>Z. marina</em> and <em>P. herbarum</em> inoculation, <em>A. vagum</em> inoculation showed a more significant impact on maize growth, both in terms of 'internal pathway' and 'external pathway', in terms of pathway level and quantity.</p><p><strong>CONCLUSIONS:</strong> These findings provide a new perspective for understanding the potential mechanisms of 'microbe-plant' interactions and also contribute to the exploration of targeted functional microorganisms that promote growth and stress resistance.</p>",

These strains were identified based on internal transcribed spacer (ITS) phylogeny and morphological characteristics, and were stored in the culture collection of the Endangered Species Breeding Laboratory of the Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. ITS sequences for the fungi are available in the GenBank database with accession numbers MN517851 (<em>A.vagum</em>, AV), OQ430726 (<em>Z.marina</em>, ZM), and MK601234 (<em>P.herbarum</em>, PH). Before inoculation, 3 DSE strains were activated in PDA for 14 d, until dark hyphae or spores were produced.</p><p><br></p><p>The culture substrate of the pot experiment was a 1:1 (w:w) mixture of washed river sand and farmland loam soil containing 1.6 mg/g of nitrate N, 0.37 mg/g of ammonia N, 19.4 \u03bcg/g of available P, 135.60 \u03bcg/ g of available K, 20.89 mg/g of organic matter, 6.60 of pH, and 715.50 \u03bcS/cm of electrical conductance, respectively. Before use, the substrate was sterilized at 121 \u2103 for 2 h6. </p><p>The seeds of maize were purchased from the Anguo Medicine Planting Site and treated with 75% ethanol for 3 min and 2.5% sodium hypochlorite for 10 min for sterilization, and then rinsed with sterile water several times<strong>[1]</strong>. The sterilized seeds germinated on moist filter paper in Petri dishes at 27 \u2103 in the dark for 6 d. Following germination, the seedlings were planted in culture pots.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Inoculation Assay:</strong></p><p>The experiment was conducted using a randomized block design, with 4 DSE inoculation treatments (<em>A.vagum</em>, <em>Z.marina</em>, <em>P.herbarum</em>, and <strong>no inoculation treatment</strong>) with 15 replicates, thus accounting for a total of 60 experimental pots. 1 sterilized seedling was planted in a culture pot (15 cm diameter, 23 cm height) containing 800 g sterilized sandy soil. For DSE inoculation, 2 x 5 mm fungal discs were cut from DSE colony and inoculated at 1 cm distance to the roots of maize seedlings, and the sterile PDA medium without fungus was inoculated as the control treatment. All inoculation procedures were conducted on an ultraclean workbench, and all experimental pots were kept in a growth chamber with 60% mean relative humidity, a 14 h light/10 h light/dark photoperiod and a temperature of 27 \u2103/22 \u2103 (day/night) for 3 mth. The maize seedlings were harvested 90 d after sowing. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Analysis of Maize Root Exudates:</strong></p><p>Root exudates were collected from different inoculation treatments in July 2022. The freshly harvested maize roots were quickly rinsed with flowing deionized water, the intact maize seedlings were separated and placed into culture dishes containing quartz sand. Each dish accommodated 6 seedlings per dish. The apparatus was placed in a light incubator (16/8 h; 24/20 \u00b0C; light/dark; relative humidity 50%) for 48 h. After removing the plants, the root exudates were collected and subsequently filtered through a 0.22 \u03bcm filter membrane.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Li N, Wang SS, Ma LL, Liu YH, Xiu YB, Li XH, Xiang GD, Hu DN, Guo XM, Zhang WY.
