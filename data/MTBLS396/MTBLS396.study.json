                "description": "Lipid Data Analyzer (LDA; http://genome.tugraz.at/lda2) provides automated and reliable annotation of lipid species and their molecular structures in high-throughput data from chromatography-coupled tandem mass spectrometry using embedded rule sets. Using various low- and high-resolution mass spectrometry instruments with several collision energies, the method's platform independence is proved. The software's reliability, flexibility, and ability to identify novel lipid molecular species may now render current state-of-the-art lipid libraries obsolete. </br></br> The biological data was used to fine-tune the developed decision rule sets. In particular, the high numbers of isobaric species and structural isomers contained in these samples helped in the detection of decisive differences for many isobaric subclasses/adducts. </br></br> Control experiment 1 assays for this study can be found in the MetaboLights study MTBLS394.</br> Control experiment 2 assays for this study can be found in the MetaboLights study MTBLS391.</br> Control experiment 3 assays for this study can be found in the MetaboLights study MTBLS398.</br> LipidBlast benchmarking assays for this study can be found in the MetaboLights study MTBLS397.</br> HCD characterization and regioisomer detection assays for this study can be found in the MetaboLights study MTBLS462.</br> <br/>Linked Studies: <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS391' target='_blank'><span class='label label-success'>MTBLS391</span></a> <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS394' target='_blank'><span class='label label-success'>MTBLS394</span></a> <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS397' target='_blank'><span class='label label-success'>MTBLS397</span></a> <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS398' target='_blank'><span class='label label-success'>MTBLS398</span></a> <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS462' target='_blank'><span class='label label-success'>MTBLS462</span></a>",

Prior to experiments, lens settings and source parameters were optimized to the signal of PE 34:1 (using protonated/deprotonated molecular ion in positive/negative ion mode, respectively) infused into the column effluent of 80% mobile phase B with a mixing tee. Ion source parameters for positive polarity were as follows: Source Voltage 4.5 kV; source temperature 375 \u00b0C; sheath gas 25 arbitrary units (AU); aux gas 9 AU; sweep gas 0 AU; capillary temperature 300 \u00b0C. Ion source parameters for negative ion mode were: Source voltage 3.8 kV; source temperature 325 \u00b0C; sheath gas 30 AU; aux gas 10 AU; sweep gas 0 AU; capillary temperature 300 \u00b0C. Full scan spectra from m/z 400 to 1,000 for positive ion mode and from m/z 400 to 1,000 in negative ion mode were acquired at a target resolution of 100,000 (FWHM at m/z 400). From each full scan spectrum, ions were selected for sequential fragmentation either in the linear ion trap (collision-induced dissociation (CID) experiments) or in the C-trap (higher-energy collision dissociation (HCD) experiments) and detected in the ion trap or the Orbitrap analyzer, respectively. For CID experiments, the 10 most abundant ions of the full scan spectrum were fragmented using He as collision gas (isolation width 1.5 m/z; activation Q 0.2; activation time 10 ms). Normalized collision energy was 50 in both positive and negative ion mode. For HCD experiments, fragment spectra of the 4 most abundant ions were collected in the Orbitrap mass analyzer at a target resolution of 7,500 (FWHM at m/z 400, isolation width 1.5 m/z; activation time 0.1 ms).

From the full scan spectra, acquired from m/z 100 to 1,700 at a rate of 4 spectra/s, tandem mass spectra of the 15 most abundant precursor ions were acquired at a scan rate of 20 spectra/s and a collision energy setting of 30. Previously detected target ions were excluded after three spectra for 9 s. Source parameters for positive and negative ion mode were as follows: Gas temperature 200 \u00b0C; gas flow 14 AU; nebulizer 35 AU; sheath gas temperature 350 \u00b0C; sheath gas flow 11 AU; capillary voltage 3,500 V; nozzle voltage 1,000 V; fragmentor 175; skimmer 65; octopole RF peak 750.\n</p>\nQ Exactive:</br>\nThe Q Exactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) was operated in DDA mode.

For both positive and negative ion mode, full scan spectra from m/z 400 to 1,050 were acquired at a target resolution of 140,000 (FWHM at m/z 200) from which ions were selected for fragmentation. Automatic gain control (AGC) target was set to 1e6 ions and the maximum injection time to 500 ms.
