                "description": "The sustainable growth of fish aquaculture will require the procurement of non-marine feed sources. Glycerol is a potential feed supplement whose metabolism may spare the catabolism of dietary amino acids, thereby extending the use of the feed protein to other physiological functions such as growth. In the present study, the effects of dietary glycerol supplementation on the muscle and liver metabolomes of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax) were evaluated. Fish juveniles were fed diets with 0%, 2.5%, and 5% glycerol. Muscle and liver aqueous fractions were extracted and 1H NMR spectra were acquired. Metabolite profiles derived from the 1H NMR signals were assessed using univariate and multivariate statistical analyses. The adenylate energy charge was determined in the muscle. For both species, the muscle metabolite profile showed more variability compared to that of the liver and was most perturbed by the 5.0% glycerol diet. For the liver metabolite profile, rainbow trout showed fewer differences compared to European seabass. No differences were observed in energy charge between experimental groups for either species. Thus, rainbow trout appeared to be less susceptible to tissue metabolite perturbations, compared to seabass, when the diet was supplemented with up to 5% glycerol.",

Briefly, a control diet with no glycerol (D0), and 2 experimental diets, supplemented with 2.5% (D2.5) or 5.0% (D5.0) glycerol, were used. Further details can be found in Table 2 in the paper associated with this study. For the sake of context, D0, D2.5, and D5.0 will hereafter be referred to as T0, T2.5, and T5.0 or S0, S2.5, and S5.0, when addressing the rainbow trout or European seabass experiments, respectively.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Fish handling and sampling - Rainbow trout:</strong></p><p>Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) experiments were carried out at the Experimental Research Station of the University of Tr\u00e1s-os-Montes e Alto Douro (UTAD, Vila Real, Portugal). 9 groups of 25 fish (average initial body weight: 20.2 \u00b1 0.1 g) were distributed in a non-predetermined pattern between 9 fiberglass tanks (volume: 300 l, water flow rate: 120 l/h), in a flow-through freshwater system (15 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C temperature, 6.7 \u00b1 0.1 pH, 8.6 \u00b1 0.7 mg/l dissolved O2, exposed to a natural photoperiod). The diets (T0, T2.5, and T5.0) were haphazardly assigned to 3 tanks each and fish were hand-fed twice daily until apparent satiety for 8 weeks. After concluding samplings for other experimental procedures, 72 fish (24 per diet, 8 from each replicate tank) were transferred into tanks with fresh water enriched with ~4% D2O in a well-aerated recirculation system equipped with an external filtering unit and UV unit for the last 6 days of feeding. 24 hr after the last meal, animals were anesthetized in tank water containing 0.1 g/l of MS-222 (Sigma-Aldrich, Stainheim, Germany) and enriched with ~4% D2O. Fish were measured, weighed, and liver was extracted and freeze-clamped in liquid nitrogen in pools of 2 livers per sample. The average final body weights were: Group T0 = 87.5 \u00b1 2.1 g, group T2.5 = 85.3 \u00b1 2.9 g, and group T5.0 = 79.4 \u00b1 1.4 g. After sacrifice using a cervical section, muscle from the epaxial quadrant was collected, weighed, and freeze-clamped in liquid nitrogen. Samples were stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until further processing.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Fish handling and sampling - European seabass:</strong></p><p>European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax) experiments were carried out at the Interdisciplinary Centre of Marine and Environmental Research (CIIMAR, Porto, Portugal). 15 groups of 6 to 8 fish (average body weight = 51.4 \u00b1 1.5 g) were distributed in a non-predetermined pattern between 15 glass tanks (volume 80 l), in a recirculated saltwater system (30\u2030 salinity, 22 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C temperature, 8.0 \u00b1 0.1 pH, 7.9 \u00b1 0.2 mg/l dissolved O2, exposed to a 12-h light/12-h dark photoperiod). The diets (S0, S2.5, and S5.0) were haphazardly assigned to 5 tanks each and fish were hand-fed twice daily until apparent satiety for 6 weeks. After concluding samplings for other experimental procedures, 72 fish (24 per diet, 4\u20135 from each replicate tank) were transferred into tanks with saltwater enriched with ~4% 2H2O in a well-aerated recirculation system equipped with an external filtering unit and UV unit for the last 6 days of feeding. 24 hr after the last meal, fish were sampled as described above for rainbow trout. The average final body weights were: Group S0 = 87.3 \u00b1 7.3 g, group S2.5 = 75.4 \u00b1 4.3 g, and group S5.0 = 87.6 \u00b1 7.3 g.</p>",

Tissue aqueous fraction extraction was performed in all samples following the MTBE (Tert-Butyl Methyl Ether) extraction method, as described previously<strong>[1]</strong>. Briefly, 4.6 ml of methanol/g of tissue was added and vortex mixed. 15.4 ml of MTBE was added incubated for 1 hr at room temperature with magnet agitation. After that, the mixture was centrifuged for 10 min at 13000 x g and the liquid separated from the pellet. Phase separation was induced in the liquid fraction by adding 4 ml of distilled water and letting rest for 10 min at room temperature. The mixture was then centrifuged at 1000 x g for 10 min. The lower phase (aqueous) was transferred to a new vial, frozen and lyophilized. Dried samples were kept at room temperature until further analysis.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Matyash V, Liebisch G, Kurzchalia TV, Shevchenko A, Schwudke D.

Univariate analysis was applied to the final concentration values for each metabolite in each sample/pool, for both tissues, using GraphPad Prism 7.0a software (GraphPad Software, Inc). ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis test was applied, according to its conformity of the data to normal distribution, to test differences between the three groups. The fold-change (FC) values of metabolite concentrations (FC = test group/control group) were calculated. For each FC value was determined the p-value, applying T-test or Mann-Whitney test, according to its normality distribution.
