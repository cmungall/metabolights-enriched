                "description": "<p>The objective of this study was to reveal the effects of early life lactoferrin intervention on the liver metabolism in the suckling piglets. Sixty newborn piglets with an average initial body weight (BW) of 1.51 \u00b1 0.05 kg were assigned to the control (CON) group and the lactoferrin (LF) group. Piglets in the LF group were orally administered LF solution (0.5 g/kg BW per day) from 1 to 7 days of age, and the piglets in the CON group were orally administrated with the same dose of physiological saline. Plasma, jejunum and liver samples were collected on day 8 and 21. The LF piglets had a decreased level of plasma urea nitrogen on day 8 and an increased level of plasma albumin on day 21. Pathway analysis of metabolomic profiles showed that LF treatment affected amino acid metabolism in the liver of piglets. Additionally, LF treatment upregulated the gene expression of proteolytic enzyme and amino acid transporters (APA, aminopeptidases A; APN, aminopeptidases N; EAAC 1, excitatory amino acid carrier 1; Pept 1, peptide transporter 1) in the jejunum, and enhanced phosphorylation levels of mTOR and p70S6K in the liver. Moreover, LF treatment upregulated the expression of \u03b2 oxidation related gene (CPT 1, carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1) and affected tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in the liver on day 21. Furthermore, LF piglets had a lower level of MDA and a higher level of GSH and GSH-px in the liver mitochondria. Overall, the early life LF intervention affected protein synthesis, energy production and antioxidative capacity in the liver of neonatal piglets.</p>",

At age 1 to 7 days, the piglets in the LF group were orally administered <strong>LF </strong>solution (35 mg mL\u22121 , Ingredia, France) 3 times per day at 09:00, 14:00 and 19:00 (0.5 g per kg BW daily), whereas the piglets in the <strong>CON </strong>group were orally administered the same dose of saline. During the suckling period (21 days), the piglets had no access to creep feed. The dose of <strong>LF </strong>used in this study was determined based on the assumption that neonatal <strong>piglets </strong>(1.5 kg BW) consume 400\u2013700 mL of colostrum per day, and this volume of colostrum contains a mean <strong>LF </strong>concentration of 1.6 g/L, which is approximately equal to 0.5 g per kg BW<strong>[1],[2].</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Sample collection </strong></p><p>On days 8 and 21, 6 piglets from each group were euthanized with sodium pentobarbital (100 mg per kg BW).

Briefly, the initial oven temperature was 60 \u00b0C (held for 1 min), and then increased to 100 \u00b0C at a rate of 8 \u00b0C/min. Subsequently, the temperature was increased at 10 \u00b0C/min to 170 \u00b0C. Finally, the oven temperature was increased to 305 \u00b0C at a rate of 8 \u00b0C/min and held for 4 min. Helium was used as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 3 mL/min. The temperatures of injection, MS quadrupole and ion source were 280, 150, and 230 \u00b0C, respectively.&nbsp;The collision energy was 70 eV. Mass spectrometric data was acquired in a full-scan mode (m/z 50-500).The QCs were injected at regular intervals throughout the analytical run to provide a set of data from which repeatability could be assessed.</p>",
