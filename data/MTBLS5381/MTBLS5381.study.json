                "description": "<p>Anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy for relapsed or refractory (r/r) large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) results in durable response in only a subset of patients. MYC overexpression in LBCL tumors is associated with poor response to treatment. We tested whether a MYC-driven polyamine signature, as a liquid biopsy, is predictive of response to anti-CD19 CAR-T therapy in patients with r/r LBCL. Elevated plasma acetylated polyamines were associated with non-durable response. Concordantly, increased expression of spermidine synthase, a key enzyme which regulates levels of acetylated spermidine, was prognostic for survival in r/r LBCL. A broad metabolite screen identified additional markers which resulted in a 6-marker panel (6MetP) consisting of acetylspermidine, diacetylspermidine and lysophospholipids which was validated in an independent set from another institution as predictive of non-durable response to CAR T therapy. A polyamine centric metabolomics liquid biopsy panel has predictive value for response to CAR-T therapy in r/r LBCL. </p>",

The clinical data and patient\u2019s serum samples were collected under existing Institutional Research Board (IRB) approved protocols at each center and conducted in accordance with institutional guidelines and the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants had consent for the use of samples in ethically approved studies. Response status was determined by Lugano 2014 classification<strong>[1]</strong>. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) were prospectively graded and managed according to the CAR T-cell therapy associated toxicity guidelines<strong>[2]</strong>. For MDACC cohort analysis, plasma samples were obtained from 43 sequential r/r LBCL patients before they received CAR T-cell infusion as a standard of care product. Of the 43 samples, 39 were collected on the day of treatment (day 0) and the remaining 4 were collected within 4 days prior to CAR T-cell therapy. &nbsp;Patients who were enrolled in CAR T-cell clinical trials were excluded from the study. For validation purpose, serum samples obtained on day of treatment prior to CAR T-cell infusion from another 28 patients from German (DKFZ) r/r LBCL cohort were analyzed.

Peak picking and retention time alignment of LC-MS and MSe data were performed using <strong>Progenesis QI</strong> software (Nonlinear, Waters). Data processing and peak annotations were performed using an in-house automated pipeline as previously described<strong>[1]-[4]</strong>. Annotations were determined by matching accurate mass and retention times using customized libraries created from authentic standards and by matching experimental tandem mass spectrometry data against the <strong>NIST</strong> MSMS, <strong>LipidBlast</strong> or <strong>HMDB</strong> v3 theoretical fragmentations; for complex lipids retention time patterns characteristic of lipid subclasses was also considered. To correct for injection order drift, each feature was normalized using data from repeat injections of quality control samples collected every 10 injections throughout the run sequence. Measurement data were smoothed by Locally Weighted Scatterplot Smoothing (LOESS) signal correction (QC-RLSC) as previously described. Values are reported as ratios relative to the median of historical quality control reference samples run with every analytical batch for the given analyte<strong>[1]-[4]</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1] </strong>Fahrmann JF, Bantis LE, Capello M, Scelo G, Dennison JB, Patel N, Murage E, Vykoukal J, Kundnani DL, Foretova L, Fabianova E, Holcatova I, Janout V, Feng Z, Yip-Schneider M, Zhang J, Brand R, Taguchi A, Maitra A, Brennan P, Max Schmidt C, Hanash S.
