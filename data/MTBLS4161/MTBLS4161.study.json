                "description": "<p>Bamboo rats (<em>Rhizomys pruinosus</em>) are among the few mammals that lives on a bamboo-based diet which is mainly composed of lignocellulose. However, the mechanisms of adaptation of their gut microbiome and metabolic systems in the degradation of lignocellulose are largely unknown. Here, we conducted a multi-omics analysis on bamboo rats to investigate the interaction between their gut microbiomes and metabolic systems in the pre- and post-weaning periods, and observed significant relationships between dietary types, gut microbiome, serum metabolome and host gene expression. For comparison, published gut microbial data from the famous bamboo-eating giant panda (<em>Ailuropoda melanoleuca</em>) were also used for analysis. We found that the adaptation of the gut microbiome of the bamboo rat to a lignocellulose diet is related to a member switch in the order Bacteroidales from family <em>Bacteroidaceae</em> to family <em>Muribaculaceae</em>, while for the famous bamboo-eating giant panda, several aerobes and facultative anaerobes increase after weaning. The conversion of bacteria with an increased relative abundance in bamboo rats after weaning enriched diverse carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) associated with lignocellulose degradation and functionally enhanced the biosynthesis of amino acids and B vitamins. Meanwhile, the circulating concentration of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) derived metabolites and the metabolic capacity of linoleic acid in the host were significantly elevated. Our findings suggest that fatty acid metabolism, including linoleic acid and SCFAs, are the main energy sources for bamboo rats in response to the low-nutrient</p>",

The captive breeding of this animal was legal before the COVID-19 outbreak, while it is now banned. Adult bamboo rats were housed in single-layer pools, with the size of each pool being 80 x 50 x 80 cm^3. For unweaned pups, the breeding pool was divided into an inner room and an outer room. The size of the inner room was 80 x 50 x 80 cm^3, and the top of the inner room was covered to reduce the effect of light and human activity on the pups. Unweaned bamboo rats (3-5 pups per litter, age &lt; 40 day) were raised with their mothers, and the activity and feeding of the mother was mainly in the outer room, while the pups gathered in the inner room; after weaning, approximately 4 bamboo rat offspring were raised in a single pool until sexual maturity. Weaned bamboo rats were fed twice daily with bamboo stems and supplemented with sugar cane and corn kernels (about 20%). We defined the <strong>pre-weaning </strong>period as being the <strong>S1</strong> stage, while the <strong>post-weaning</strong> period before adulthood was the <strong>S2</strong> stage.</p><p><br></p><p>Sampling from bamboo rats was conducted on March 28th-29th, 2019. Tissue, blood and intestinal contents were sampled from 24 bamboo rats (6 animals each at the ages of <strong>15</strong>, <strong>30</strong>, <strong>45</strong> and <strong>80 day</strong>). For adult bamboo rats (age &gt; 1 year), we only collected fecal samples. For serum sampling, venous blood from each animal was collected into commercial vacuum blood collection tubes and left at room temperature for 30-40 min. Tubes were then centrifuged for 10 min at 3500 rpm and 0.5-1.0 mL portions were immediately aliquoted into 2 mL microtubes. After blood collection, bamboo rats were euthanized by intravenous injection of sodium pentobarbital (150 mg/kg). The duodenum, cecum and colon tissues were rapidly removed and dissected. Fresh digesta samples were collected into 2.5 mL sterile sampling tubes. Duodenum, colon and liver tissue were collected and quickly placed into 2.5 mL sterile sampling tubes. For stool sample collection, fresh feces from different bamboo rats of about 1, 2 and 3 years of age were picked up from their breeding pools and placed into 2.5 mL sterile sampling tubes. All collected samples were transported to the lab on dry ice and stored at -80 \u00b0C until further experimental analysis.</p>",

Accurate qualitative and relative quantitative results were achieved by matching the peaks to the <strong>mzCloud</strong> (<a href='https://www.mzcloud.org/' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>https://www.mzcloud.org/</a>) and <strong>ChemSpider</strong> (<a href='http://www.chemspider.com/' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>http://www.chemspider.com/</a>) databases. Metabolites were then annotated using the <strong>KEGG</strong>, <strong>HMDB[1]</strong>, and <strong>LIPID MAPS[2]</strong> databases.</p><p><br></p><p>Basic metabolomic data handing including statistical analysis, Pattern Hunter analysis, biomarker analysis and enrichment analysis were performed with <strong>MetaboAnalyst</strong> (v5.0)<strong>[3]</strong>. To reduce baseline noise, the features were excluded if their relative standard deviation (RSD) were higher than 25% in the QC samples or near-constant throughout all samples detected by interquartile range (IQR). Data normalization was achieved by log transformation and uv scaling (mean-centered and divided by the standard deviation of each variable). For screening differential metabolites, we considered the variable importance of projection (VIP) value of the first principal component of the partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), fold change (FC) and statistical significance of the variables calculated by t-test. Differential metabolites were defined if VIP &gt;1, FC &gt; 2.0 or FC &lt; 0.5 and p value &lt; 0.05. Correlation analysis based on Spearman correlation coefficient (r) was performed against a given pattern consistent with the dietary types (S1 or S2 stage). The metabolites with significant and robust correlation (FDR p &lt; 0.05, |r| \u2265 0.6) were used for KEGG enrichment analysis. Classical univariate ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve analysis was performed to generate the ROC curve. The excellent predictive performance was evaluated by calculating the area under the ROC curve (AUC) &gt; 0.9<strong>[4]</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Wishart DS, Feunang YD, Marcu A, Guo AC, Liang K, V\u00e1zquez-Fresno R, Sajed T, Johnson D, Li C, Karu N, Sayeeda Z, Lo E, Assempour N, Berjanskii M, Singhal S, Arndt D, Liang Y, Badran H, Grant J, Serra-Cayuela A, Liu Y, Mandal R, Neveu V, Pon A, Knox C, Wilson M, Manach C, Scalbert A.
