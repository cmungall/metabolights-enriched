                "description": "The standardized extract of Centella asiatica (ECa233) contains >80% triterpenoids with a ratio of madecassoside to asiaticoside of 1.5(\u00b10.5):1. Hepatoprotective effect of ECa233 has not yet been reported. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of ECa233 on liver metabolome of rotenone-treated rats to better understand the underlying mechanisms of this bioactive substance in liver tissue. Rats were randomly divided into three groups (with six rats/group): sham negative control, rotenone positive control, and the ECa233 test group. Rats in the ECa233 group received 10 mg/kg ECa233 orally for 20 days, followed by 2.5 mg/kg intraperitoneal rotenone injection to induce toxicity before being sacrificed. The liver samples were collected for antioxidant assays and untargeted metabolomic analysis using a GC-MS. Antioxidant tests revealed that ECa233 inhibited lipid peroxidation and increased catalase activities in liver tissue. Orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis clearly showed complete separation between control and rotenone groups, whereas the ECa233 group was located between these two groups and tended to reverse the effects of rotenone treatment. Two candidate markers were identified, pipecolinic acid and Unknown #21. Findings from this study suggested that supplementation of ECa233 protected rat liver against rotenone toxicity. However, further investigations are needed to elucidate the mechanisms involved.",

The syringe was washed at least 3 times with acetone between the adding steps. The inlet temperature was set at 250 \u00b0C. The column temperature was initially set at 85 \u00b0C for 5 min. The temperature was increased to 205 \u00b0C at 8 \u00b0C/min and maintained for another 5 min. The temperature was increased again to 300 \u00b0C at a rate of 8 \u00b0C/min and held for 15 min.",
