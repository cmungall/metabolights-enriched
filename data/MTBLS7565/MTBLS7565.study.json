                "description": "<p>Human brain organoids are emerging models to study human brain development and pathology as they recapitulate the development and characteristics of major neural cell types, and enable manipulation through an <em>in vitro</em> system. Over the past decade, with the advent of spatial technologies, mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) has become a prominent tool for metabolic microscopy, providing label-free, non-targeted molecular and spatial distribution information of the metabolites within tissue, including lipids. This technology has never been used for studies of brain organoids and here, we set out to develop a standardized protocol for preparation and mass spectrometry imaging of human brain organoids. We present an optimized and validated sample preparation protocol, including sample fixation, optimal embedding solution, homogenous deposition of matrices, data acquisition and processing to maximize the molecular information derived from mass spectrometry imaging. We focus on lipids in organoids, as they play critical roles during cellular and brain development. Using high spatial and mass resolution in positive- and negative-ion modes, we detected 260 lipids in the organoids. Seven of them were uniquely localized within the neurogenic niches or rosettes as confirmed by histology, suggesting their importance for neuroprogenitor proliferation. We observed a particularly striking distribution of ceramide-phosphoethanolamine CerPE 36:1; O2 restricted within rosettes and of phosphatidyl-ethanolamine PE 38:3, which was distributed throughout the organoid tissue but not in rosettes. This suggests that ceramide in this particular lipid species might be important for neuroprogenitor biology, while its removal may be important for terminal differentiation of their progeny. Overall, our study establishes the first optimized experimental pipeline and data processing strategy for mass spectrometry imaging of human brain organoids, allowing direct comparison of lipid signal intensities and distributions in these tissues. Further, our data shed new light on the complex processes that govern brain development by identifying specific lipid signatures that may play a role in metabolic cell fate trajectories. mass spectrometry imaging thus has great potential in advancing our understanding of early brain development as well as disease modeling and drug discovery.</p>",

In this organoid model, iPSC cultures are subsequently transferred into low-attachment AggreWell 800 to develop about 300 embryoid bodies. To achieve rapid and efficient neural induction, both the Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2) signaling pathways are inhibited with small molecules, dorsomorphin and SB-431542, respectively. Here, we used induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) generated by reprogramming of control fibroblast cells (GM01888, https://catalog.coriell.org/0/Sections/Search/Sample_Detail.aspx?Ref=GM01888&amp;Product=CC) with Sendai virus<strong>[11]</strong>. We assessed the derived iPSC pluripotency using Karyostat, pluripotency score (Thermo Fisher), alkaline phosphatase staining (Vector Red Substrate Kit, Alkaline Phosphatase, SK-5100), and differentiation into each of the three germ layers (Human Pluripotent Stem Cell Functional Identification Kit, R&amp;D system Catalog: SC027B). iPSCs of high purity were placed in the AggreWell plate and on day eight, the floating spheroids were moved to suspension dishes and serum-free media containing fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) and ascorbic acid. To promote differentiation of neuroprogenitors into neurons, FGF2 was replaced with brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophic factor 3 (NT3) starting on day 22-60, after which we used only neural medium without growth factors. Using this method, we can produce functional organoids with mature neurons and glial cells, preserving tissue architecture and orientation<strong>[12]</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Pa\u0219ca AM, Park JY, Shin HW, Qi Q, Revah O, Krasnoff R, O'Hara R, Willsey AJ, Palmer TD, Pa\u0219ca SP.

They were washed 3x times with 1x Dulbecco\u2019s phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS), without CaCl2 and MgCl2 (Life Technologies, cat. no. 14190-144) and then with distilled water. The organoids were then put firmly in the center of the Cryomolds cast blocks (25 mm x 20 mm x 5 mm) and embedding solution (10% of gelatin from fish (Sigma-Aldrich G7041-100G) or porcine skin (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no. G1890), or culture-grade distilled water) was poured over and allowed to solidify. Next, 10% of gelatin solutions were prepared by stirring and heating the respective gelatin at 70-80 \u00b0C for 2 h, and then moving to 37 \u00b0C incubator for 30 min to remove bubbles and to equilibrate to the temperature of the incubator where organoids were grown. The molds with the organoid-gelatin/water suspension was rapidly frozen by placing the molds into a Petri dish sitting on dry ice and containing cold 100% ethanol. When completely frozen, evident by a change in color to solid white, the organoid-gelatin/water blocks were taken out and stored in aluminum foil or tin cups at -80 \u00b0C. Tissue samples were cut in 14 \u03bcm sections with a cryotome from -20 to -25 \u00b0C.

                        "description": "<p>A high resolution MSI platform for visualizing brain organoid lipids was implemented by mounting a MALDI ion source containing a dual-ion funnel interface (Spectroglyph LLC, United States) to a Q-Exactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Massachusetts, United States)<strong>[1][2]</strong>. An attached Q-switched frequency tripled Nd:YLF laser of 349-nm wavelength was used at a repetition rate of 1 KHz and pulse energy of ~1.3-1.4 \u03bcJ. The laser was focused and controlled to a spot size of ~15 \u03bcm in diameter. The sample was attached to the MALDI injector stage and the high-pressure ion funnel was maintained at 7.4-7.5 Torr. The low-pressure ion funnel was maintained at 1.6-1.8 Torr.We applied 604 kHz, 80 V0-peak and 780 kHz, 191 V0-peak radio frequency voltages to the high and lowpressure ion funnels, respectively. The Orbitrap mass spectrometry was operated at ion injection time of 250 ms and Fourier Transform MS (FTMS) spectra were acquired in a profile mode using a target mass resolution of 70,000 (Full Width Half Maximum (FWHM) at m/z 400, m/z = mass-to-charge ratio). During MALDI imaging, mass spectrometer starts to acquire data after switching on to contact closure. The signal is sent from the MALDI injector and communicated via the \u2018Peripheral Control\u2019 input connection at the side of the Q Exactive MS, and the automatic gain control was switched off.</p><p><br></p><p>Data were acquired in the m/z range of 200-1000 and brain organoid image generation was done using an HR-MALDI-MSI system in both positive and negative ion modes. Samples were scanned with lateral resolution of 25 \u03bcm pixel size for 14 \u03bcm organoid sections of 2-4 mm (h) x 1-1.5 mm (w) size. The Q Exactive MS was operated in positive-ion mode with the mass range of m/z = 400-1000 whereas in negative ion mode, the mass range was m/z = 200-1000. DAN matrix peaks were used for internal calibration resulting in a mass accuracy of better than \u00b15 ppm. The laser beam was focused carefully to avoid oversampling. Automatic gain control was turned off and C-trap injection time was fixed to 250 ms.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Belov ME, Ellis SR, Dilillo M, Paine MRL, Danielson WF, Anderson GA, de Graaf EL, Eijkel GB, Heeren RMA, McDonnell LA.

This software package was used to generate mass images from raw data files with a bin width of \u0394m/z = 0.01 or \u00b15 ppm to discriminate m/z images based on mass defect and pixel coverage. Mass spectra from 25 \u03bcm/pixel were obtained and all lipid ions were assigned within a mass accuracy of \u00b15 ppm.
