                "description": "<p><strong>OBJECTIVE:</strong> To explore the cardioprotective effects of exercise-derived \u03b2-aminoisobutyric (BAIBA) on cardiomyocyte apoptosis and energy metabolism in a rat model of heart failure (HF).</p><p><strong>METHODS:</strong> In male Sprague-Dawley rats (8-week-old), myocardial infarction (MI) was used to induce HF by ligating the left anterior descending branch of the coronary artery. In the Sham group, the coronary artery was threaded but not ligated. After HF development, Sham and HF rats were exercised 60 min daily, 5 days per week on a treadmill for 8 weeks (50-60% maximal intensity) and exercise-induced cardiac remodeling after MI were assessed using echocardiography, hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E), Masson\u2019s Trichrome and TUNEL staining for the detection of apoptosis-associated factors in cardiac tissue. High-throughput sequencing and mass spectrometry were used to measure BAIBA production and to explore its cardioprotective effects and molecular actions. To further characterize the cardioprotective effects of BAIBA, an <em>in vitro</em> model of apoptosis was generated by applying H2O2 to H9C2 cells to induce mitochondrial dysfunction. In addition, cells were transfected with either a miR-208b analogue or a miR-208b inhibitor. Apoptosis-related proteins were detected by Western Blotting (WB). ATP production was also assessed by luminometry. After administration of BAIBA and Compound C, the expression of proteins related to apoptosis, mitochondrial function, lipid uptake and \u03b2-oxidative were determined. Changes in the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were assessed by fluorescence microscopy. In addition, alterations in membrane potential (\u03b4\u03c8m) were obtained by confocal microscopy.</p><p><strong>RESULTS:</strong> Rats with HF after MI are accompanied by mitochondrial dysfunction, metabolic stress and apoptosis. Reduced expression of apoptosis-related proteins was observed, together with increased ATP production and reduced mitochondrial dysfunction in the exercised compared with the Sham (non-exercised) HF group. Importantly, exercise increased the production of BAIBA, irrespective of the presence of HF. To assess whether BAIBA had similar effects to exercise in ameliorating HF-induced adverse cardiac remodeling, rats were treated with 75 mg/kg/day of BAIBA and we found BAIBA had a similar cardioprotective effect. Transcriptomic analyses found that the expression of miR-208b was increased after BAIBA administration, and subsequent transfection with an miR-208b analogue ameliorated both the expression of apoptosis-related proteins and energy metabolism in H2O2-treated H9C2 cells. In combining transcriptomic with metabolomic analyses, we identified AMPK as a downstream target for BAIBA in attenuating metabolic stress in HF. Further cell experiments confirmed that BAIBA increased AMPK phosphorylation and had a cardioprotective effect on downstream fatty acid uptake, oxidative efficiency and mitochondrial function, which was prevented by the AMPK inhibitor Compound C.</p><p><strong>CONCLUSION: </strong>Exercise-generated BAIBA can reduce cardiomyocyte metabolic stress and apoptosis induced by mitochondrial dysfunction through the miR-208b/AMPK pathway.</p>",

                        "description": "<p>Animal experiments were approved by the ethics committee of the First Hospital of Jilin University. Male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (8 weeks, 250 g) were used. In male Sprague-Dawley rats (8-week-old), myocardial infarction (MI) was used to induce heart failure (HF) by ligating the left anterior descending branch of the coronary artery<strong>[1]</strong>. In the Sham group, the coronary artery was threaded but not ligated. The procedure was carried out under aseptic conditions and anesthesia induced by inhaling oxygen anesthesia containing 1.5-2.0% isoflurane. After disinfection, the skin of the prothoracic area was cut longitudinally, the chest muscle was separated, the intercostal space was exposed and punctured, and the anterior descending branch of the coronary artery was ligated after separating the pericardium. The soft tissue and skin of the chest was sutured and disinfected with penicillin. Intraperitoneal injections of 160,000 units/day penicillin were administered for a total of 7 days. After 4 weeks, after the procedure, the rats were examined by echocardiography and divided into separated groups according to ejection fraction (EF) %. Details of the groups are shown in <strong>File S1</strong> in the paper associated with this study. Briefly, for the exercise studies, rats were divided into 4 groups: (i) Sham; (ii) heart failure (HF); (iii) heart failure with exercise (HFE); and (iv) Sham and exercise (ShamE) groups. For the \u03b2-aminoisobutyric (BAIBA) studies, rats were divided into 3 groups: (i) Sham; (ii) heart failure (HF); (iii) heart failure with BAIBA groups. For the exercise groups, rats were exercised daily on a treadmill (Shanghai Ruanlong Technology Co., Ltd. BW-ZHPT) involving 10-20 min acclimation, 0.3-0.6 km/h and 0% incline. After 3 days\u2019 acclimation, the maximum exercise intensity was tested, starting at 0.3 km/h and increasing by 0.3 km/h every 3 min until&nbsp;exhaustion<strong>[2]</strong>. The rats were run on the treadmill for 8 weeks (50-60% of maximum intensity), 60 min/day, 5 days/week, and at a 0% incline. For the BAIBA studies, BAIBA (MCE; HY-113380) was administered orally by gavage at a daily dose of 75 mg/kg for 8 weeks<strong>[3][4]</strong> to rats with HF. The corresponding dose of BAIBA was dissolved in 1 mL ddH2O, and the rats in the Sham group and the HF group were given the same volume of ddH2O orally by gavage. At 12 weeks post-op, rats in each group were examined by echocardiography, and the hearts were quickly removed under deep anesthesia. After the heart was removed, it was washed with cold PBS, dried with sterile medical gauze. Part of the left ventricle was quickly fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for subsequent histological evaluation, while part of the left ventricle was quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen (or at -80 \u00b0C) for subsequent transcriptomic, proteomic, and biochemical analysis. All experiments were conducted following the guidelines of animal research institutions and in accordance with the guidelines for the Care and Use of Experimental Animals published by the National Institutes of Health (NIH publ.no.85-23, revised in 1996).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Muthuramu I, Lox M, Jacobs F, De Geest B.

For peak picking, the following parameters were used: centWave, m/z = 25 ppm, peakwidth = c(10,60) and prefilter = c(10,100). For peak grouping, bw = 5, mzwid = 0.025 and minfrac = 0.5 were used. In the extracted ion features, only the variables having more than 50% of the nonzero measurement values in at least one group were kept. After normalization to total peak intensity, the processed data were uploaded before importing into <strong>SIMCA-P</strong> (version 16.1, Umetrics, Umea, Sweden), where the data were subjected to multivariate data analysis, including Pareto-scaled principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA). The 7-fold cross-validation and response permutation testing was used to evaluate the robustness of the model. The variable importance in the projection (VIP) value of each variable in the OPLS-DA model was calculated to measure its contribution to the classification. Metabolites with VIP values &gt; 1.0 was further analyzed for significance using Student\u2019s t-test at the univariate level, with p-values less than 0.05 considered as statistically significant.</p><p><br></p><p>For KEGG pathway annotation, the metabolites were blasted against the online <strong>Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes</strong> (<strong>KEGG</strong>) database (<a href='http://geneontology.org/' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>http://geneontology.org/</a>) to retrieve their COs and were subsequently mapped to pathways in KEGG. The corresponding KEGG pathways were extracted. For functional enrichment analysis, to further explore the impact of differentially expressed metabolites, enrichment analysis was performed. KEGG pathway enrichment analyses were applied based on the Fisher\u2019 exact test, considering the whole metabolites of each pathway as background dataset. Only pathways with p-values under a threshold of 0.05 were considered as significant. For hierarchical clustering, the studied metabolites relative expression data was used to performing hierarchical clustering analysis. For this purpose, <strong>Cluster3.0</strong> (<a href='http://bonsai.hgc.jp/~mdehoon/software/cluster/software.htm' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>http://bonsai.hgc.jp/~mdehoon/software/cluster/software.htm</a>) and the <strong>Java Treeview</strong> software (<a href='http://jtreeview.sourceforge.net' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>http://jtreeview.sourceforge.net</a>) were used. Euclidean distance algorithm for similarity measure and average linkage clustering algorithm (clustering uses the centroids of the observations) for clustering were selected when performing hierarchical clustering.</p>",
