The WT cc406 was selected as reference strain, because Stm6Glc4 originated from a similar genetic background. For H2 production experiments, cultures were grown under continuous illumination in Tris acetate phosphate medium until they reached the late logarithmic growth phase. After changing the medium (triplicate washes with sulfur-depleted Tris acetate phosphate medium followed by centrifugation at 2,500 x g, 4 min, 20 \u00b0C), the cultures were adjusted to ~1.2 x 107 cells per ml (~27 \u00b5g of chlorophyll/ml) and supplemented with 1 mM glucose for optimal H2 production in Stm6Glc4. The gas-tight bioreactors were then illuminated with continuous light (300\u00b5mol/m2/s) for up to 120 h. H2 Measurement\u2014H2 production was determined volumetrically, and the gas quality was measured via gas chromatography as described in a previous study [1].\n</p>\nChlorophyll Fluorescence Measurements:</br>\nChlorophyll a fluorescence yields were determined at room temperature (Mini- PAM, Walz, Germany). Photosynthetic quantum yield (Phi PSII) was determined by illuminating cell suspensions with actinic white light (300 \u00b5mol/m2/s, saturation pulse of 15,000 \u00b5mol/m2/s). Fluorescence parameters were recorded, and quantum yield was calculated (Phi PSII = (F'_m - F_t)/F'_m) and recorded every 2 h.\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Doebbe A, Rupprecht J, Beckmann J, Mussgnug JH, Hallmann A, Hankamer B, Kruse O.
