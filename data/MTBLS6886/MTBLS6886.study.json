                "description": "<p>The mechanisms by which macrophage metabolism is regulated and the effects of metabolism on diseases remain largely unknown. We show here that TGF-\u03b2 regulates the glycolysis of macrophages independently of inflammatory cytokine production, and thus affects the survival in experimental sepsis. Specifically, TGF-\u03b2 increased expression and activity of phosphofructokinase-1 liver type (PFKL) in macrophages and thus promoted their glycolysis during cell activation, yet paradoxically suppressed the production of proinflammatory cytokines in the same macrophages. The upregulation of glycolysis was mediated by a mTOR-c-MYC dependent pathway, whereas the inhibition of cytokines was ascribed to the activation of SMAD3 and a downregulated activation of the pro-inflammatory transcription factors AP-1, NFkB and STAT1. Importantly, in an LPS-induced endotoxemia and CLP-sepsis models, TGF-\u03b2 enhancement of macrophage glycolysis led to a decreased survival in mice, which was associated with increased blood coagulation. Analysis of cohorts of patients with sepsis and covid-19 revealed that the expression of PFKL, TGF-\u03b2 receptor TGFBRI and coagulation factor F13A1 in myeloid cells positively correlated with the progression of the disease. Thus, TGF-\u03b2 is emerging as a critical cytokine regulating macrophage metabolism and could serve as a therapeutic target in patients with sepsis.</p>",

Cells were sonicated for 30 s at 40 Amps followed by vortexing for 10 s (medium speed) to homogenize prior to aspirating 0.04 mL aliquots for protein quantification used later to normalize metabolite abundance. An equivolume of methanol (MeOH) was added to the aqueous cell homogenate followed by addition of 0.1 mL 50% aqueous MeOH spiked with the qualitative internal standards [(qIS), consisting of 100 ng/mL nitrodracylic acid (NDA) and 125 ng/mL isocaramidine sulfate (ICS)]). The solution was vortexed for 10 s and incubated for 10 min, follow by the addition of 100 \u00b5L chilled chloroform spiked with the qIS of 50 ng/mL phenyl-N-pyridinyl acrylamide (PNPA) to achieve a final ratio of 2:2:1.5 of a water:MeOH:CCl4 solution. The solution was vortexed for 15 s and incubated for 30 min. Samples were centrifuged for 20 min at 12,000 x g at 4 \u00b0C. The two resulting phases (upper aqueous polar and lower organic lipid) were transferred to separate 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes and evaporated at room temperature under a dry nitrogen stream.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Lita A, Pliss A, Kuzmin A, Yamasaki T, Zhang L, Dowdy T, Burks C, de Val N, Celiku O, Ruiz-Rodado V, Nicoli ER, Kruhlak M, Andresson T, Das S, Yang C, Schmitt R, Herold-Mende C, Gilbert MR, Prasad PN, Larion M.

Agilent <strong>Masshunter Profinder</strong> B.08.00 was used to bin mass features on basis of m/z with retention time (RT) matrices. Bins were manually inspected for consistent integration for each reported compound across every samples. Precursor m/z for each bin alignment was determined using the molecular feature extraction algorithm to deconvolute, integrate and envelope parent ions, adducts (H-, H+) and natural isotopes defined in each composite spectrum. Logical binning was aligned based on restriction to 0.5 min elution window and target mass selection of \u00b12.0 mDa.</p><p><br></p><p>Following preprocessing, raw abundance to sample-specific internal standard ratios were determined to correct abundances, followed by normalization via sample-specific protein quantification (as determined via BCA protein analysis). For polar feature analysis based on the HILIC-Z gradient, the qIS NDA and ICS abundances were uses for the ESI negative and positive mode data, respectively. The qIS PNPA was used to correct abundance for both ESI positive and negative mode data acquired from nonpolar extracts using the reverse phase C18 gradient. Normalized abundance data acquired from both polar and nonpolar phases were combined according to sample ID for further comparative analysis. <strong>Metabolanalyst</strong> 4.0 was utilized to conduct biostatistical analysis with student t-test assuming equal variance and to generate figures for comparative analysis. Graphs were generated via <strong>Excel</strong>.</p>",
