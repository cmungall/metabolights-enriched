                "description": "<p>Despite intensive research and constant medical progress, sepsis remains one of the most urgent unmet medical needs of today. Most studies have been focused on the inflammatory component of the disease, however, recent advances support the notion that sepsis is accompanied by extensive metabolic perturbations. During times of limited caloric intake and high energy needs, the liver acts as the central metabolic hub in which PPAR\u03b1 is crucial to coordinate the breakdown of fatty acids. The role of hepatic PPAR\u03b1 in liver dysfunction during sepsis has hardly been explored. We demonstrate that sepsis leads to a starvation response that is hindered by the rapid decline of hepatic PPAR\u03b1 levels, causing excess free fatty acids, leading to lipotoxicity, and glycerol. In addition, treatment of mice with the PPAR\u03b1 agonist pemafibrate protects against bacterial sepsis by improving hepatic PPAR\u03b1 function, reducing lipotoxicity and tissue damage. Since lipolysis is also increased in sepsis patients and pemafibrate protects after the onset of sepsis, these findings may point towards new therapeutic leads in sepsis.&nbsp;</p>",

Liquid chromatography was achieved on a Dionex Ultimate 3000 XRS UHPLC system (Thermo Fischer Scientific) and MS analysis was carried out by high-resolution hybrid quadrupole Q-Exactive Orbitrap MS (Thermo Fisher Scientific) as previously published[1]. Briefly, liquid chromatography was achieved on a Dionex Ultimate 3000 XRS UHPLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific), which was equipped with an Acquity ethylene-bridged hybrid (BEH) phenyl column (2.1 x 150 mm, 1.7 \u03bcm). Hereby, a binary solvent system consisting of ultrapure water (solvent A) and methanol (solvent B), both acidified with ammonium acetate (3.5 mM), was used to establish a gradient elution program. The following proportions (v/v) of solvent B were used: 0\u20131 min at 75%, 1\u20132 min from 75% to 90%, 2-6 min from 90% to 98%, 6\u201315 min from 98% to 100%, and 15\u201317 min at 100%, followed by 3 min of equilibration at initial conditions. A constant flow rate of 300 \u03bcl/min and a column oven temperature of 40 \u00b0C were set.</p><p><br></p><p>Analytical reference standards were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. A selection of the reference standards can be found in Table S3 in the paper associated with this study, the full standard list has been previously published<strong>[1]</strong>. To correct for instrumental drift, biological samples, i.e., quality control (QC) samples, were used. These QC samples are considered as representative bulk control samples and were prepared by pooling all samples. QC samples were dispersed evenly across the sample batch and duplicate QC injections were performed after every 10 samples. The average signal of those two injections was used for normalizing the 10 preceding samples. Samples were injected in a randomized order. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Van Meulebroek L, De Paepe E, Vercruysse V, Pomian B, Bos S, Lapauw B, Vanhaecke L.
