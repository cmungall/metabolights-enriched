                "description": "<p><strong>BACKGROUND AND AIMS:</strong> The increasing incidence of cardiovascular diseases has created an urgent need for safe and effective anti-thrombotic agents. Leech, as a traditional Chinese medicine, has the effect of promoting blood circulation and removing blood stasis, but its real material basis and mechanism of action for the treatment of diseases such as blood stasis and thrombosis have not been reported.</p><p><strong>METHODS:</strong> In this study, <em>Whitmania Pigra Whitman</em> (WPW), <em>Hirudo nipponica Whitman</em> (HNW) and <em>Whitmania acranutata Whitman</em> (WAW) were hydrolyzed by biomimetic enzymatic hydrolysis to obtain the active peptides of WPW (APP), the active peptides of HNW (APH) and the active peptides of WAW (APA), respectively. Then their structures were characterized by sykam amino acid analyzer, fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FT-IR), circular dichroism (CD) spectrometer and LC-MS. Next, the anti-thrombotic activities of APP, APH and APA were determined by carrageenan-induced tail vein thrombosis model in mice, and the anti-thrombotic mechanisms of high-dose APP group (HAPP), high-dose APH group (HAPH) and high-dose APA group (HAPA) were explored based on UHPLC-Q-Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometry.</p><p><strong>RESULTS:</strong> The results showed that the amino acid composition of APP, APH and APA was consistent, and the proportion of each amino acid was few different. The results of FT-IR and CD showed that there were no significant differences in the proportion of secondary structures (such as \u03b2-sheet and random coil) and infrared absorption peaks between APP, APH and APA. Mass spectrometry data showed that there were 43 common peptides in APP, APH and APA, indicating that the three have common material basis. APP, APH and APA could significantly inhibit platelet aggregation, reduce black-tail length, whole blood viscosity (WBV), plasma viscosity (PV), and Fibrinogen (FIB), and prolong coagulation time, including activated partial thrombin time (APTT), prothrombin time (PT) and thrombin time (TT). In addition, 24 metabolites were identified as potential biomarkers associated with thrombosis development. Among these, 19, 23, and 20 metabolites were significantly normalized after administration of HAPP, HAPH, and HAPA in the mice, respectively. Furthermore, the intervention mechanism of HAPP, HAPH and HAPA on tail vein thrombosis mainly involved in linoleic acid metabolism, primary bile acid biosynthesis and ether lipid metabolism.</p><p><strong>CONCLUSION:</strong> Our findings suggest that APP, APH and APA can exert their anti-blood stasis and anti-thrombotic activities by interfering with disordered metabolic pathways in vivo, and there is no significant difference in their efficacies.</p>",

The mice were treated via intragastric administration for 10 days and the mice in the Con and Mod were administered the same volumes of normal saline. After 10 days, mice from all the other groups except the Con were intraperitoneally injected with 0.5% carrageenan (type I) solution after the last gavage to establish the thrombus model<strong>[1]</strong>. After 48 h of modeling, the mice were anesthetized with 10% chloral hydrate and blood samples were obtained from the abdominal aorta.

In a single analytical run, the peaks were monitored in both the positive and negative ion modes. The ion source parameters were as follows: (1) ion spray voltages were set at 3.5 kV in the positive ion mode and 3.0 kV in the negative ion mode; (2) Nitrogen (purity&nbsp;\u2265&nbsp;99.99%) was used as the sheath gas and the auxiliary gas at a flow rate of 30 and 10 arbitrary units, respectively; (3) capillary temperature was set at 320 \u00b0C and vaporizer temperature was set at 400 \u00b0C. The orbitrap mass analyzer was used to acquire a high-resolution mass spectrum at full scan in a mass range of 70-1050 m/z at a resolution of 70,000<strong>[1]</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Shi Z, Ge X, Zheng S, Zeng P, Su Z, Li X, Zhang J.

At the same time, some data were verified by manual screening in the process of data processing to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the results. Then, principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal to partial least squares-discriminate analysis (OPLS-DA) was performed for the processed datasets using the SIMCA-P 14.0 software (Umetrics, Sweden). S-plots were used to screen differential metabolites in the tail vein thrombosis model after treatment with HAPP, HAPH and HAPA in combination with other judgment methods, such as variable importance in projection (VIP) (generated in the OPLS-DA mode) and p-value (formed from relative intensity). Finally, we extracted further information for the differential metabolites, including molecular formulas, molecular weights and codes, using the HMDB dataset (http://www.hmdb.ca/), KEGG dataset (https://www.kegg.jp/) and VMH dataset (http://www.vmh.life).</p>",
