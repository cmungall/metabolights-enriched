                "description": "Preprocessing data in a reproducible and robust way is one of the current challenges in untargeted metabolomics workflows. Data curation in liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) involves the removal of unwanted features (retention time; m/z pairs) to retain only high-quality data for subsequent analysis and interpretation. The present work introduces a package for the Python programming language for pre-processing LC-MS data for quality control procedures in untargeted metabolomics workflows. It is a versatile strategy that can be customized or fit for purpose according to the specific metabolomics application. It allows performing quality control procedures to ensure accuracy and reliability in LC-MS measurements, and it allows preprocessing metabolomics data to obtain cleaned matrices for subsequent statistical analysis. The capabilities of the package are showcased with pipelines for an LC-MS system suitability check, system conditioning, signal drift evaluation, and data curation. These applications were implemented to preprocess data corresponding to a new suite of plasma candidate plasma reference materials developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST; hypertriglyceridemic, diabetic, and African-American plasma pools) to be used in untargeted metabolomics studies. in addition to NIST SRM 1950 \u2013 Metabolites in Frozen Human Plasma. The package offers a rapid and reproducible workflow that can be used in an automated or semi-automated fashion, and it is an open and free tool available to all users.",

All NIST plasma samples were collected after informed consent under approved IRB protocols reviewed by the NIST Human Subjects Protection Office. Details on the preparation of SRM 1950 have been published. Bioreclamation, Inc. (Hicksville, NY) collected whole blood from 100 donors (1:1 male to female ratio) between 40 and 50 years of age after an overnight fast and a 72 h abstention from medication. Lithium heparin was used as the anticoagulant. The collected blood was centrifuged at 8000 \u00d7 g for 25 min at 4 \u00b0C to obtain plasma. Each donor\u2019s plasma was thawed once. Subsequently, all donor plasma was blended together and aliquoted into individual vials to produce the SRM. The diabetic plasma material (RM 8231-1) was created by Solomon Park Research Laboratories, Inc. It was created from a pool of 6 female donors and 5 male donors between 34 and 68 years of age after an overnight fast, each meeting the specified ranges for glucose (&gt;126 mg/dL) and triglycerides (&lt;150 mg/dL). Solomon Park Research Laboratories, Inc. (Kirkland, WA) also created the hypertriglyceridemic plasma material (RM 8231-2). The donor pool consisted of 11 male donors between 31 and 72 years of age after an overnight fast, each meeting the NIST-specified ranges for glucose (&lt;100 mg/dL) and triglycerides (&gt;300 mg/dL). The diabetic and hypertriglyceridemic plasma were obtained by centrifuging the respective collected blood at 251 rad/s for 10 min, followed by additional centrifugation at 397 rad/s. Lithium heparin was used as the anticoagulant for both, and plasma from each donor was thawed once and blended to make the respective donor pools before aliquoting into individual vials. BioreclamationIVT (Westbury, NY) collected whole blood from 16 donors (1:1 male to female ratio) between 20 and 25 years of age after an overnight fast using K2 ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) as the anticoagulant for the African-American plasma (RM 8231-3). The 16 units of blood were subsequently thawed and pooled by Solomon Park Research Laboratories similar to the diabetic and hypertriglyceridemic plasma materials. Samples were shipped on dry ice to CONICET and stored at -80 \u00b0C until use.</p>",

The typical resolving power and mass accuracy of the Xevo G2S QTOF mass spectrometer were 27102 FWHM and 2.7 ppm at m/z 556.2771, respectively. The mass spectrometer ion source was operated with a probe capillary voltage of 2.5 kV and a sampling cone voltage of 30 V. The source and desolvation gas temperatures were set to 120 and 300 \u00b0C, respectively. The nitrogen gas desolvation flow rate was 600 L h\u22121, and the cone desolvation flow rate was 10 L h\u22121. The mass spectrometer was calibrated before the batch analysis across the range of m/z 50\u22121200 using a 0.5 mM sodium formate solution prepared in isopropanol/water (90:10 v/v). Data were drift corrected during acquisition using a leucine enkephalin (<em>m/z</em> 556.2771) reference spray infused at 5 \u03bcL min\u22121, every 60 s. The scan time was set to 0.5 s and data were acquired in MSE continuum mode in the range of m/z 50\u22121200.</p>",

Spectral features (retention time (Rt), m/z pairs) were extracted from UPLC-QTOF-MS data using Progenesis QI version 2.1 (Nonlinear Dynamics, Waters Corp., Milford, MA, USA). The procedure included retention time alignment, peak picking, deisotoping, integration, and grouping together adducts derived from the same compound.</p><p><br></p><p>Raw data conversion:\tRaw MS data in Waters .RAW format where converted to mzML format in centroid mode using ProteoWizard\u2019s msconvert software (version 3.0) with the following parameters: min distance = 0.01, snr = 1. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Python package:\tThe package was implemented in python 3.6. and uses the Pandas library to work with a data matrix in tabular form. Raw MS data is read using the pyopenms library and routines for analyzing data were implemented using the Numpy, Scipy and Scikit-Learn libraries. Examples of web applications were built using the Bokeh library. The pyopenms package was used to read raw MS data in the mzML format. Peak picking functions were implemented using a CWT-based algorithm with parameters optimized for chromatographic or spectral data. Additional functions were implemented for chromatogram-building, for accumulating consecutive MS scans, detecting features using the CentWave algorithm, and for feature detection. MSData, Chromatogram, Roi and MSSpectrum were created using an object-oriented programming approach to abstract the aforementioned functionality and work with raw data.  </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Curation tools:\tMethods for filtering features in the data matrix are encapsulated in the Data Container, Processor and Pipeline objects. The Data Container uses Pandas DataFrames to store the data matrix and the descriptors associated with features and samples. The sample mapping attribute of the Data Container object associates sample types to sample classes and it is used to set a default behaviour for the different filters applied to the data matrix. The Pipeline object stores a list of Processor objects to build customized data curation strategies. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Statistical analysis:\tPrincipal component analysis (PCA) models are built using the Scikit-Learn implementation. It is used in the pipeline to track data quality, identify potential outliers in the data set, identify sample clusters and evaluate time-related systematic variance or signal drift. The LOESS smoother used in Batch Correction is implemented in the statsmodels package.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",
