                "description": "Introduction: The high market value of saffron (Crocus sativus L.) has made it an attractive candidate for adulteration. Safflower (Carthamus tinctorius L.) and tartrazine are among the most common herbal and synthetic foreign materials that may be added to pure saffron for the purpose of adulteration. In spite of encouraging advances achieved in the identification of adulteration in saffron samples, the lack of a simple method with sufficient power for discrimination of pure high grade saffron from meticulously adulterated saffron samples persuaded us to perform this study. Objectives: In this work, we show that 1H NMR spectroscopy together with chemometric multivariate data analysis methods can be used for the detection of adulteration in saffron. Methods: Authentic Iranian saffron samples (n?=?20) and adulterated samples that were prepared by adding either different quantities of natural plant materials such as safflower, or synthetic dyes such as tartrazine or naphthol yellow to pure saffron (n?=?22) composed the training set. This training set was used to build multivariate Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) models. The predictive power of the PLS-DA model was validated by testing the model against an external dataset (n?=?13). Results: PCA and PLS-DA models could both discriminate between the authentic and adulterated samples, and the external validation showed 100% sensitivity and specificity for predicting the authenticity of suspicious samples. Peaks specific to authentic and adulterated samples were also characterized. Proximity of samples with unknown adulteration status to the samples adulterated with known compounds in the PCA provided insight regarding the identity of the adulterant in the suspicious samples. Furthermore, the authentic samples could be distinguished based on their cultivation site. Conclusion: The present study demonstrates that the application of 1H NMR spectroscopy coupled with multivariate data analysis is a suitable approach for detection of adulteration in saffron specimens. Outstanding sensitivity and specificity of the PLS-DA model in discriminating the authentic from adulterated samples in external validation confirmed the high predictive power of the model. The advantage of the present method is its power for detecting a wide spectrum of adulterants, ranging from synthetic dyes to herbal materials, in a single assay.",

A separate set of samples was also provided by the Iranian Food and Drug Control Laboratories (FDCL) (n=13). The authenticity of these samples was confirmed by microscopic investigations and information gathered from the food control inspectors. These samples were used as a validation set, and the investigators were blinded to the classification of the samples until the completion of the multivariate analysis.",

Univariate scaling was applied to overcome the dominating effect of higher intensity metabolite features. Thus scaling gives equal importance to all the components. Logarithmic transformation was also done before analysis to reduce the effect of data skewness.</br>\n</p>\nPCA was performed to check the unsupervised segregation of the metabolome. OPLS-DA allowed us to discriminate between the different variables concerning the samples in context. Model significance was assessed using a cross-validated ANOVA with p \u2264 0.05 considered significant. Variables were selected according to the VIP (variable influence on projection) as previously described [1], which are reflective of the correlation of the metabolites towards different response.  VIP > 1 was considered significant.[2]\n</p>\nSignificant metabolites were identified and qualified either by using Chenomx NMR Suite 3.1 Characteristic NMR features of Saffron, Safflower and synthetic dyes software (version 7.5, Edmonton, Alberta, 2013), or were assigned based on literature data [3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10].
