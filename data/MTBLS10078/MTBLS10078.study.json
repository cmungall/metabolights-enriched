                "description": "To investigate how early mono- and dual species biofilms of oral Actinomyces naeslundii and Streptococcus gordonii clinical isolates metabolized glucose in the presence of the complex salivary mucin MUC5B, this study employed NMR-based metabolomics with interpretation of network integration. Untargeted NMR data analysis for metabolite detection and annotation and in silico studies of biochemical relationships between metabolites and cellular processes was performed to study functional differences in the early biofilm metabolomes. Significant differences in metabolite abundance elicited by the presence of MUC5B were detected. The main metabolites that distinguished the biofilms grown with 25% MUC5B with 20 mM glucose (MUC5B+G) from those grown with physiologic buffer with 20 mM glucose (PBS+G) were the unannotated metabolites 68 and 73. In the conditions were they were each present, pyruvate, ethanol and metabolite 134 were significantly more abundant in the presence of MUC5B, while metabolites 84, 97 and sarcosine were significantly less abundant. The pathway enrichment analysis of the metabolites that were differently expressed in early A. naeslundii, S. gordonii and dual species biofilms grown with PBS+G or MUC5B+G showed that pyruvate metabolism was significantly over-represented. Studying the metabolic interactions between commensal members of oral biofilms and modulatory effects of host factors such as glycoproteins in saliva during metabolism of substrates that are potential drivers of dysbiosis, such as glucose, is essential to understand the roles of oral microbial ecosystems in oral health and disease.",

                        "description": "<p>Whole saliva (non-stimulated) from 9 healthy adults was collected on ice and pooled. For MUC5B enrichment, isopycnic density gradient centrifugation was carried out as previously described (Davies et al., 2012). Briefly, the pooled saliva was diluted 1:2 in 0.2 M NaCl and centrifuged to remove debris at 4400 x g, 4 \u00b0C for 30 min (Beckman Coulter Avanti J-E centrifuge, JA 20 rotor). After centrifugation, CsCl was added to set the starting density to 1.45 g/mL, and ultracentrifugation at 36.000 rpm, 15 \u00b0C for 96 h was performed (Beckman Coulter Optima LE-80K Ultracentrifuge, 50.2 Ti rotor). A total of 24 fractions \u00e0 1.7 mL were then collected and pooled separately. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays using antibodies for the MUC5B polypeptide backbone central domain (6F10-E4, Novus Biological) were utilized to detect enriched fractions. These fractions were then pooled to produce a MUC5B-enriched solution. Thereafter, the solution was dialyzed in 100 kDa molecular weight cut-off tubing (Spectra/PorTM Dialysis Membrane Biotech CE tubing) against sterile 10 mM phosphate buffer with 0.07 mM NaCl pH 7.5 (PBS) and stored at -80 \u00b0C until use. Protein concentration was 0.3 mg/mL, determined by freeze drying and weighing after dialysis against water for removal of salts.</p><p><br></p><p><em>A. naeslundii</em> CW and S. gordonii CW from blood agar was inoculated to 25% Todd-Hewitt Yeast Extract (1/4 THYE, Becton Dickinson) and cultured overnight at 37 \u00b0C in 5% CO2. The following day, the bacterial suspensions were washed by centrifugation (50 mL tubes, 5 \u00b0C, 3000 rpm, 10 min, Beckman GS-6R centrifuge) and resuspended in sterile PBS to an optical density (600 nm) of 0.5 which corresponds to similar cell counts between the two species, 1 x 10^8 CFU/mL for A. naeslundii CW and 1.5 x 10^8 CFU/mL for S. gordonii CW). MUC5B-conditioning solution was prepared by diluting MUC5B-solution in 1:5 in PBS and adding 0.1% w/v CaCl2 (final concentration). Twelve-well plates and Ibidi VI 0.1 \u03bc-slides (Ibidi GmbH, Munich, Germany) were pre-coated with the MUC5B-conditioning solution and incubated overnight in room temperature (RT). To initiate biofilm formation, uncoated and MUC5B-coated wells of twelve-well plates were inoculated with the bacterial suspensions, separately for monospecies biofilms or 1:1 v/v of each strain for dual species, to produce a final volume of 2 mL per biofilm and incubated at 37 \u00b0C in 5% CO2 for 3 h to allow the cells to attach. After the attachment phase, buffer supernatant and non-adherent cells were extracted by gentle rinsing with PBS and replaced with 25% MUC5B in PBS with 20 mM glucose (MUC5B+G) or PBS with 20 mM glucose (PBS+G) and incubated for another 2 h as described in previous steps.</p>",

The readx1 package was used to import the corresponding metadata. The data was processed with the speaq package speaq (Beirnaert, 2023). The getWaveletPeaks function with baselineThresh = 0, SNR.Th = 10 and include_nearbyPeaks = TRUE was used to select peaks. The PeakGrouper function with grouping.window.width = 200 and min.samp.grp = 10 was used for grouping. The SilhouetR function was run and groups with a value &lt; 0.5 were listed to be regrouped in a repeat run. The PeakFilling function was run filling in missing values with max.index.shift = 200.
