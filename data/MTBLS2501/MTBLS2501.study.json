                "description": "Coenzyme A (CoA) is an essential molecule acting in metabolism, post-translational modification, and regulation of gene expression. While all organisms synthesize CoA, many, including humans, are unable to produce its precursor, pantothenate. Intriguingly, like most plants, fungi and bacteria, parasites of the coccidian subgroup of Apicomplexa, including the human pathogen Toxoplasma gondii, possess all the enzymes required for de novo synthesis of pantothenate. Here, the importance of CoA and pantothenate biosynthesis for the acute and chronic stages of T. gondii infection is dissected through genetic, biochemical and metabolomic approaches, revealing that CoA synthesis is essential for T. gondii tachyzoites, due to the parasite's inability to salvage CoA or intermediates of the pathway. In contrast, pantothenate synthesis is only partially active in T. gondii tachyzoites, making the parasite reliant on its uptake. However, pantothenate synthesis is crucial for the establishment of chronic infection, offering a promising target for intervention against the persistent stage of T. gondii.",

Catalytic domain of PBAL (PBALcd) was selected based on sequence homology and comparison with published crystal structures (PDB: 2X3F), PCR amplified with primers 10166/10167 and cloned NsiI/KpnI in pOV1380. PANC was PCR amplified from E. coli with primers 10076/10077 and cloned NsiI/KpnI into the pET-modified vector. PBAL was expressed in Rosetta DE3 pLysS cells. From a preculture, 1.5 l of cells were grown until reaching OD600 of 0.6, maintained on ice for 1 h and induced by addition of 0.5 mM IPTG. Protein expression was done for 15 h at 20 \u00b0C in a shaking incubator. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3000 g for 12 min at 4 \u00b0C. The pellet was resuspended in 60 ml of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol), lysed by shear forces by passing the sample twice through the Microfluidizer at 15\u2019000 psi. Soluble material was separated from membranes and cell debris by centrifugation at 35\u2019000 g for 35 min at 4 \u00b0C. Supernatant was syringe-filtered at 5 \u03bcm and applied to a 5 ml STREP-tactin XT Superflow (iba) column. Column was washed first with 40 ml of lysis buffer supplemented with 250 mM NaCl, then with 40 ml of lysis buffer. Bound protein was eluted by applying 15 ml of lysis buffer containing 50 mM Biotin. Collected protein was concentrated and applied to a Superdex 200, 10/300 size-exclusion chromatography column equilibrated in PBS. Fractions containing MBP-PBALcd were pooled and concentrated to 500 \u00b5l using AMICON 30 MWCO. Protein concentration was estimated by measuring absorbance at 250 nm using a NanoDrop (ThermoFisher Scientific).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1] </strong>Donald RG, Carter D, Ullman B, Roos DS.

The polar and apolar phases were separated through centrifugation (21,000 g, 6 min, 4 \u00b0C). The polar phase was taken off and sequentially dried (50 \u03bcl) in a glass vial insert suitable for mass spectrometry vials using a centrifugal evaporator. For GC-MS analysis, samples were methoximated by resuspending the dried extract in 20 \u03bcl pyridine (Sigma 270970) containing methoxyamine-hydrochloride (20 mg/ml; room temperature, over-night, Sigma 226904) and trimethylsilylated shortly before analysis through addition of 20 \u03bcl N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide with 1 % trimethylchlorosilane (BSTFA-TMCS, Cerilliant, Sigma B-023).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>LCMS metabolite extraction (for reverse phase)</strong></p><p>Parasites (108 cells) were harvested as described above. Metabolites were extracted from cell pellets by adding 200 \u03bcl acetonitrile/ultrapure water (4:1) and vortexing vigorously. Insoluble material was pelleted through centrifugation (21,000 g, 6 min, 4 \u00b0C). For reversed-phase UHPLC-MS experiments the metabolite extract was sequentially dried as described above and resuspended in 50 \u03bcl ultrapure water. For HILIC HPLC-MS analyses, the metabolite extract was injected directly. For metabolite quantification experiments, 10 \u03bcM 13C3/15N-Pan was included in the extraction solvent as internal standard. In the labelling analysis, no internal standard was used.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>PBAL Activity Assay</strong></p><p>PBAL enzymatic activity was assessed by incubating the purified enzymes in a PBS buffer containing final concentrations of 3 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5% BSA, 10 mM MgCl2, 15 mM KCl, 100 \u00b5M ATP, with or without 5 mM \u03b2-Ala and 5 mM pantoate (pantoic acid sodium salt, Sigma 16682). Buffer&nbsp;composition was based on Miyatake et al.64. Reactions were performed in 15 \u00b5l with 500 nM MBP, 500 nM MBP-PS, or 5 \u00b5M MBP-PBALcd for 1 hour at 27 \u00b0C, or 5-fold serial dilutions (5, 1, 0.2, and 0.04 \u00b5M) of MBP and MBP-PBALcd for 30 minutes at 27 \u00b0C. The reaction was stopped by addition of 65 \u03bcl acetonitrile (final 80%) and centrifuged at 20,000 g at 4 \u00b0C to remove salts and proteins. The supernatant was transferred to an insert and vial suitable for mass spectrometry analysis.&nbsp;</p>",

The MRM transitions of the precursor ion (Q1) and product ion (Q3), as well as the collision energy (CE) are summarized in the <strong>table </strong>(<strong>Q1 and Q3 </strong>were operated at unit resolution - see paper associated with this study)</p><p><br></p><p>For the analyses performed with the QTRAP 6500, the following UHPLC-MS conditions were used: 8&nbsp;\u03bcl of sample (6 \u00b0C) were injected and eluted with the same gradient and column as described above. The mass spectrometer was operated with the same settings as previously mentioned except the curtain plate (CUR) and collision cell exit (CXP) potentials set to 30&nbsp;V and 8&nbsp;V respectively. The declustering potential (DP) was of 90&nbsp;V. The set of MRM transitions was the same with the addition of 2 transitions to monitor dephospho-CoA.</p><p>Blanks (ultrapure water) were injected after every sample to avoid carry-over.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>PBAL Activity Assay</strong></p><p>The mass spectrometer was operated in negative polarity with a HESI II ion source. Electrospray voltage was set to -2500 V; the sheath gas, auxiliary gas and sweep gas were set respectively to 35, 10 and 1 (arbitrary units, nitrogen). The auxiliary gas heater and transfer capillary temperatures were of 200&nbsp;\u00b0C and 250\u00b0C. The looped MS experiments were a full MS experiment (m/z 70-1050) followed by 5 PRM experiments targeting: \u00df-Ala, Pan and pantoate. All experiments were acquired in profile mode at 35k resolution with an AGC of 1e6 and a fill time of 100ms (1&nbsp;\u00b5scan). The PRM experiments were performed at a normalized collision energy of 45 with a precursor isolation window of 0.7u. </p>",

Previously, a detailed GC-MS study of the 3-TMS-Pan derivative investigated its fragmentation during electron ionization demonstrating that the ion m/z 420 corresponds to [M-CH3]+, while ions m/z 291 and m/z 201 derive from complex rearrangements but contain the full backbone of the \u03b2-Ala fraction of Pan 65. Labelling efficiency in Val and \u03b2-Ala derivatives was determined by quantifying the ions m/z 218 and 290 and their isotopologues. The Val ion m/z 218 is composed of two distinct fragments, which contain 3 and 5-labelled atoms of 13C5/15N-Val. The M+3 ion is likely derived from loss of the side chain [M-C3H7]+, the atomic composition of the M+5 fragment is unclear. The \u03b2-Ala ion m/z 290 corresponds to [M-CH3]+. Labelling in Pan was determined by quantifying the isotopologue distribution for the ion m/z 420 (following 13C5/15N-Val labelling) and m/z 201 (following 13C3/15N-\u03b2-Ala labelling). Parental ions and their isotopologues were quantified using <strong>Xcalibur </strong>(ThermoFisher Scientific), <strong>OpenChrom </strong>and <strong>Excel </strong>(Microsoft) software following correction for natural abundance 66.Relative concentration of Pan, Val and \u03b2-Ala was determined by quantifying abundance of the parental ions m/z 201, 218 and 290, respectively, in unlabelled samples relative to the ion m/z 318 of the internal standard (scyllo-inositol).&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>LCMS</strong></p><p>The retention time and mass spectrum of each metabolite was determined using authentic standards.&nbsp;</p>",
