                "description": "The primary aim of the study is to investigate the temporal changes in plasma lipidome before and after reperfusion in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and their association with myocardial injury. We found that 56% of the identified lipid species were significantly altered (corrected p< 0.05) in the first 24\u00a0h following reperfusion in patients with STEMI. Three lipid species, namely, acylcarnitine 18:2, TG 51:0, and LPC 17:1 were associated with a change in troponin concentration (delta troponin) and in-hospital cardiovascular events. Of these, acylcarnitine 18:2, and LPC 17:1 and their respective whole class levels, were significantly higher (p\u00a0< 0.05) in the STEMI population than the age/sex-matched control subjects. Overall, our analyses showed a large shift in plasma lipidome in patients that undergo myocardial reperfusion. The differences found for acylcarnitines and LPC species and their association with both cardiac markers and cardiac outcomes need further validation.",

The diagnosis of <strong>STEMI </strong>was based on presentation with chest pain, confirmation of ST-elevation on 12-lead ECG, and documentation of occluded coronary artery with coronary angiography. The samples were collected from <strong>STEMI </strong>patients (n=80) by venipuncture at 3 time points. The <strong>time points </strong>include the time of presentation at cardiac catheterization laboratory, but before reperfusion (<strong>pre-PCI</strong>), 2 h post successful&nbsp;reperfusion (<strong>2 h post-PCI</strong>), and 24 h post successful reperfusion (<strong>24 h post-PCI</strong>). To better understand the late response to reperfusion, in a sub-section of the STEMI cohort (n=30), <strong>blood </strong>samples were prospectively collected at 2 additional time points, including 48 h after reperfusion (<strong>48 h post-PCI</strong>) and<strong> 30 days post successful reperfusion</strong>. For the age/sex-matched comparison population (n=50), blood from patients referred for diagnostic coronary angiography without any evidence of coronary disease was collected after angiography. <strong>Plasma </strong>was collected after centrifugation (2,500g, 5 min, 4 \u00b0C) and was immediately stored at - 80 \u00b0C until required. The average time between blood collection to <strong>plasma </strong>separation and aliquoting was less than 20 min.

                        "description": "<p>Lipid extraction was done using chloroform and methanol<strong>[1][2]</strong>. Briefly, plasma samples were thawed, and 10 \u00b5l of plasma was dispensed to a 1.5 ml polypropylene tube (Eppendorf). To the tube, 30 \u00b5l of lipid internal standards (ISTD) in chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v) was added alongside 200 \u00b5l of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v). Table S1 contains the complete list of lipid abbreviations. ISTDs were either odd-chain or deuterated and are not present endogenously (see <strong>Table S2</strong> in the paper associated with this study). The mixture was vortexed on a rotary mixer for 10 min and sonicated in a water bath at room temperature (RT) for 30 min. The mixture was subsequently allowed to settle for 20 min and then centrifuged (20,000 g, 20 min, RT). The upper lipid-containing phase was transferred into a clean polypropylene tube and dried under a stream of nitrogen gas at room temperature. Lipids were reconstituted in 50 \u00b5l water-saturated 1-butanol and sonicated for 10 min. Finally, 50 \u00b5l of 10 mM ammonium formate in methanol was added to the final lipid extract. The extract was centrifuged (10,000 g, 10 min, RT), and 80 \u00b5l of the supernatant was transferred into the micro insert in sample vials for lipid analysis.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Quality Control </strong></p><p>The study followed the guidelines outlined by the lipidomics consortium for analytical quality assurance<strong>[3][4]</strong>. The plasma samples were randomized before analysis. The sample run order was given in <strong>Table S4 </strong>in the paper associated with this study. 6 injections of blank extracts, in the 33 beginning, were used to identify the common contaminations. This study used 2 types of quality control (QC) samples to ensure analytical reproducibility and quality. A plasma quality control (PQC) sample was prepared by pooling equal aliquots (20 \u03bcl) from all samples. To assure the stability of the analytical platform, 10 PQC samples were run at the beginning of each batch. In addition, PQC samples were intermittently injected throughout each batch to monitor and compensate for inter-batch analytical variability. Also, lipid extracts without matrix (plasma), referred to as technical quality control (TQC) samples, were analyzed at even intervals during the analytical batch. They were used to monitor the technical variation in LC/MS over time. Additionally, 4 replicate injections of a global shared reference sample (NIST SRM 1950 plasma<strong>[3]</strong>) were included in each analytical batch to enable future comparison with different datasets.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1] </strong>Weir JM, Wong G, Barlow CK, Greeve MA, Kowalczyk A, Almasy L, Comuzzie AG, Mahaney MC, Jowett JB, Shaw J, Curran JE, Blangero J, Meikle PJ.

The separation was achieved on a Zorbax C18, 1.8 \u03bcm, 50 \u00d7 2.1 mm column (Agilent Technologies, Mississauga, ON). The flow rate was set to 300 \u00b5l/min using a linear gradient of mobile phase A and mobile phase B. Mobile phase A and B consisted of tetrahydrofuran, methanol, and water in the ratio 20:20:60 (v/v/v) and 75:20:5 (v/v/v), respectively. Both A and B contained 10 mM ammonium formate. The elution program was as follows: start with 0% solvent B; increase to 100% B at 8.00 min; maintained at 100% B for 2.5 min; and back to 0% B over 0.5 min. The column was finally re-equilibrated to the starting conditions (0% mobile phase B) for 3 min before the next sample injection. Diacylglycerol (DG) and triacylglycerol (TG) species were separated in an isocratic fashion (100 \u00b5l/min) by employing 85% mobile phase B over 8 min. The analytical column and autosampler were maintained at 50 \u00b0C and 25 \u00b0C, respectively, during the analysis. The injection volume was 5 \u00b5l.</p>",

                        "description": "<p>Lipids eluted from the HPLC system were introduced into the AbSciex 4000 QTRAP triple quadrupole linear hybrid mass spectrometer. The mass spectrometer was operated in scheduled Multiple Reaction Monitoring (MRM) mode. In total, 322 unique lipids spanning 25 different lipid classes/subclasses were screened for targeted semi-quantitation (<strong>Tables S3 </strong>in the paper associated with this study). All lipid species other than fatty acids were scanned in positive electrospray ionization mode [ESI+] mode. The individual lipids in each lipid class were identified by lipid class-specific precursor ions or neutral losses (<strong>Table S2 </strong>in the paper associated with this study). Lipids were then quantified by comparing the deisotoped lipid peak areas against those of the class-specific ISTDs added before lipid extraction. The linearity plot of lipid internal standards (ISTDs) in plasma is shown in <strong>Figure S1 </strong>in the paper associated with this study. Lipids were represented by the total carbon number of the fatty acids. The collision energy and declustering potential for each lipid class were fixed individually using flow injection analysis (<strong>Table S3 </strong>in the paper associated with this study). In the ESI+ mode, the instrument settings were optimised as follows: curtain gas (psi), 26; collision gas (nitrogen), medium; ion spray voltage (V), 5500; temperature (\u00b0C), 500.0; ion source gas 1 (psi), 40.0; ion and source gas 2 (psi), 30.0. The MRM detection window was fixed between 45s and 90s depending upon the chromatographic peak width of the lipid class. Isobaric species within the same class, such as PC(O) and PC(P), exhibited clear separation in this method (<strong>Figure S2A </strong>in the paper associated with this study). Also, molecular species within the same lipid class, which differ only in the number of double bonds, were well separated chromatographically (<strong>Figures S2B, S2C </strong>in the paper associated with this study). MRM transitions were established to detect phosphocholine (PC) containing oxidized phospholipids (OxPL) molecules in ESI+ mode using a product ion of 184.3 m/z, matching the cleaved phosphocholine moiety. Six commercially available OxPL standards (PONPC, POVPC, PGPC, PAzPC, KOdiAPC, and KDdiAPC) were injected, and accurate peak assignments were made based upon retention times and mass transitions (<strong>Figure S2D </strong> in the paper associated with this study). Additionally, M+1/M+2 isotopes were scanned for high-intensity lipid species to prevent detection saturation. The detection of neutral lipids, including CE, DG, and TG species in ESI+ mode, was reported using ammonium salts generated in the presence of ammonium formate contained in the mobile phase.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Fatty acids</strong>: Acidic compounds, namely free fatty acids (FA), were detected in the negative ESI mode (ESI-) using a \u201cpseudo-molecular\u201d multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) as previously described<strong>[1]</strong>. In the ESI- mode, ion source parameters including collision energy and declustering potential were optimized by flow injection analysis using commercially bought FA standards. Accordingly, the turbo ion spray voltage was set to \u22124500 V and the source temperature to 500 \u00b0C. Nitrogen was used as collision gas, and its pressure was set to \u201cmedium\u201d. The nebulizer gas was set to 40 psi, the auxiliary gas (GS2) to 30 psi, and the curtain gas to 26 psi. Thirteen commercially available FA standards were purchased, and accurate peak assignments were made based upon retention times and mass transitions. 2 MRM transitions corresponding to the monoisotopic [M-H]- mass of the FA analyte were monitored for each FA. Though these MRM transitions have the same fragment and product ions, they differ in their collision cell parameters.&nbsp;The first MRM transition with a low collision energy was used for quantification, while the second MRM transition with increased collision energy provided an unambiguous FA identification. In short, the second MRM for each FA served as a second qualification parameter.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1] </strong>Hellmuth C, Weber M, Koletzko B, Peissner W.

There were 20 PQC samples within an analytical batch, 6 TQC samples, 4 SRM samples, and 12 blank extracts. The mass spectrometer\u2019s source was cleaned after two successive batches. To compensate for time-dependent drifts and batch variations, we used a PQC based normalization method known as systematic error removal using random forest (SERRF) as previously described<strong>[1]</strong>. The ratio of study samples to PQC samples was kept at 10:1. After batch correction, lipids were considered reproducible only if their coefficient of variation (CoV) among PQC samples was &lt;20% and their highest mean was not in the blank extracts. Outliers with CoV &lt;20% were removed (n=31), and only 291 lipid species were found&nbsp;&nbsp;eligible for subsequent downstream analysis. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to evaluate the data consistency for all samples across all batches (<strong>Figure S4 </strong>in the paper associated with this study). The tight clustering of identical samples (PQC, SRM) in the PCA plot validates the data quality after SERRF normalization.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS</strong></p><p>Statistical analysis was done using the <strong>SPSS v24</strong> (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA) software. Baseline participants\u2019 characteristics were presented as mean \u00b1 SD for continuous variables with normal distribution, median (25th, 75th percentiles) for continuous variables with non-normal distribution, and count (percentage) for categorical variables. The normality assumption of data was checked using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Based on the data distribution, the Chi-square test was used to assess differences in data across groups for categorical variables, and the Mann-Whitney U test or Student\u2019s t-test was used for continuous variables as applicable. All tests were 2-sided, and p values &lt;0.05 were considered statistically significant. The lipid data were log-transformed before statistical analysis. A repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a Greenhouse-Geisser correction was used to find the differentially regulated lipid species across time points. For pairwise comparisons, only corrected p &lt;\u20090.05 were considered statistically significant. The \u201ccorrected p\u201d denotes the false discovery rate (FDR) correction using the Bonferroni technique. The built-in \u2018pheatmap\u2019 package in <strong>R </strong>statistical software <strong>v3.5.2 </strong>(<a href='https://www.r-project.org' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>https://www.r-project.org</a>) was used to compute and draw the clustered heatmap. The general linear regression model in <strong>SPSS </strong>employing the \u2018Enter\u2019 method was used to examine the associations between delta troponin (\u2206 cTnT) and lipid species, adjusting for the other covariates.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Fan S, Kind T, Cajka T, Hazen SL, Tang WHW, Kaddurah-Daouk R, Irvin MR, Arnett DK, Barupal DK, Fiehn O.
