                "description": "<p>Cisgenesis, the genetic modification of a plant with genes from a sexually compatible plant, was used to confer fire blight resistance to the cultivar 'Gala Galaxy' by amendment of the resistance gene FB_MR5, resulting in the line C44.4146. To verify whether cisgenesis changed other tree-, flower-, or fruit-related traits, a 5-year field trial was conducted with trees of C44.4.146 and multiple control cultivars, including members of the 'Gala' sports group. None of the 44 investigated tree-, flower-, or fruit-related traits significantly differed between C44.4.146 and at least one of the control cultivars in all observation years. However, fruits of C44.4.146 and its wild-type 'Gala Galaxy' from tissue culture were paler in color than fruits of 'Gala Galaxy' that had not undergone tissue culture. The abundance of no metabolite in the fruit flesh and peel of C44.4.146 was consistently significantly different from the control genotypes in both observation years. Finally, the disease resistance of C44.4.146 was confirmed also when the fire blight pathogen was inoculated through the flowers. We conclude that the use of cisgenesis to confer fire blight resistance to 'Gala Galaxy' in C44.4.146 did not have unintended effects and that the in vitro establishment of 'Gala Galaxy' had a greater effect on C44.4.146 properties than its cisgenic generation.</p>",
