                "description": "<p>Endometrial diseases are common gynecological diseases that disorder women of childbearing age and perimenopausal women, including endometrial polyps (EP),&nbsp;endometrial cancer (EC), and endometrial hyperplasia (EH). Clinically, biopsy or imaging methods are usually used to screen and diagnose endometrial diseases, but due to their invasiveness and heterogeneity, a noninvasive, convenient, objective and accurate biomarker is needed for the differential diagnosis of EP and EC or EH. In the present study, serum samples from 396 patients with endometrial disease and 225 healthy volunteers were analyzed by UPLC-Q-TOF/MS non-targeted lipidomics. A combination of multivariate (Orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis) and univariate (Student t-test) analyses were used to identify and qualify 6, 8, and 7 potential biomarkers in serum from patients with EP, EC, and EH, respectively.&nbsp;With the aid of logistic regression algorithm and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, A biomarker panel including four specific EP biomarkers, 6-Keto-PGF1\u03b1, PA(37:4), LysoPC(20:1) and PS (36:0), had good classification and diagnostic ability in distinguishing EP from EC or EH. The biomarker panel can be used as a rapid diagnostic method to assist imaging examination to effectively differentially diagnose endometrial diseases, and provide a reference for clinicians in the identification and diagnosis of endometrial diseases.&nbsp;</p>",
