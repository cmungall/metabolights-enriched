                "description": "<p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> Diet is foods and drinks regularly consumed, and its regulation is complicated. It is necessary to obtain a practical understanding of which foods and drinks contribute to health and well-being and which are insalubrious. Clear evidence shows that a high intake of fruity beverage (FB) is associated with a higher risk of metabolic syndromes; unlike FB, the health outcome of fruit juice (FJ) intake is still controversial. Here, we aim to reveal the health outcomes of diet intervention (FJ or FB) with system profiling via the interaction of gut microbiota and metabolomics.</p><p><strong>RESULTS:</strong> Firstly, the glucose, sucrose, fructose and other bioactive metabolites of FJ and FB were analyzed, and FJ possessed higher sucrose and flavonoids, while FB showed higher glucose and fructose. Secondly, C0 was set as the control group on Day 0, and a 4-week diet invention was performed to control, FJ-intake and FB-intake groups with normal saline, FJ and FB, respectively. Then, disparate trends in the metabolic syndrome of FJ-intake and FB-intake groups were revealed through the diet-microbiome-metabolic pathway axis. FJ improved alpha diversity and decreased the F/B ratio of gut microbiota as well as prevented insulin resistance with the reduced food intake in the FJ-intake group. However, FB possessed unchanged microbial diversity and enhanced F/B ratio, causing insulin resistance with renal triglyceride accumulation, increased kidney mass index as well as steadily improved weight change in FB-intake group.</p><p><strong>CONCLUSIONS:</strong> The distinct processing degrees could explain the different FB and FJ intake responses in rats. FB with excess free fructose belongs to ultra-processed foods, while FJ with higher flavonoids belongs to minimally processed foods. We genuinely believe that FJ with a lower processing degree, although naturally contains the similar total amount of 3 main free sugars as FB, could be a healthier drink choice.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Lipidomics assay</strong>&nbsp;is reported in the current study&nbsp;<a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS4108 ' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS4108</strong></a>.</p><p><strong>Metabolomics assay</strong>&nbsp;is reported in&nbsp;<a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS3943' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS3943</strong></a>.</p>",

All experimental procedures described here were conducted following the National Institutes of Health Guidelines on the Care and Use of Laboratory Animal of Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Beijing Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co., Ltd. The approve code is SCXK-2016\u20130006. The permission code is P2021032.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Animal experiment</strong></p><p>First, 6-8 week-old SD (Rattus norvegicus) rats (male; SPF; the mean weight of 209 g) were purchased from Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co. Ltd (Beijing, China). The animal feeds were purchased from Keao Xieli Feed Co., Ltd (Beijing, China), and the primary nutrients of animal feed are shown in <strong>Table S4</strong> in the paper associated with this study. The rats were kept under controlled light conditions (12 h light-dark cycle) with free access to feed and water throughout the entire intervention.</p><p><br></p><p>The design of drink intervention study is shown in <strong>Figure S5</strong>. The rats were acclimatized for 7 days, and the weight, fasting blood glucose (FBG), total cholesterols (TC), total triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were recorded on the last day of acclimatization. When the rats were adapted to the experiment condition during the first week, body weight, FBG, TC, TG, HDL-C and LDL-C were measured to divide these rats into 4 groups, denoted as <strong>C0</strong>, <strong>control</strong> (C-4W), <strong>FJ-intake</strong> (fruit juice not from concentrate; NFC-FJ-4W) and <strong>FB-intake</strong> (sugar-sweetened fruity beverages; SS-FB-4W), respectively. After grouping, there are no significant differences in these indexes among groups.</p><p><br></p><p>For C0, cecum and serum samples were directly collected after 7 days of acclimatization and stored at -80 \u00b0C until analysis. Then, rats were dissected to obtain kidney, brain, liver, fat, colon, intestine and cecum. The organ mass was recorded and the organs were stored at -80 \u00b0C until analysis.</p><p><br></p><p>The control and 2 intervention groups (control, FJ-intake and FB-intake) proceeded with formal intervention for 28 days. Under the regular diet, the rats were gavaged with normal saline for control, FJ and FB, FJ-intake and FB-intake, respectively (twice per day). Each rat was given the equivalent of one adult (60 kg) drinking 300 mL of drinks a day. The specific volume of gavage was calculated as 31.5 times the volume of each rat's last measured body weight (for example, if the last measured weight of a rat is 0.2 kg, its gavage volume is 6.3 mL per day). During the 28-day diet, the weight, FBG, TC, TG, HDL-C and LDL-C were recorded once per week. On the last day, samples from the 3 groups were collected and stored under the same condition as C0. The organ index was calculated based on the ratio of organ mass to body weight. In total 120 samples of the cecum and serum samples (60 samples each) from all the rats were obtained.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Metabolomics &amp; Lipidomics</strong></p><p>The ultrahigh-pressure liquid chromatography coupled with a quadrupole time-of-flight mass (UHPLCQTOF MS) was performed. The samples were subjected to a reversed-phase chromatography using an LC system (SCIEX, USA). Mass spectrometric analysis was performed with a QTOF MS with a DuoSpray ion source (TripleTOF 6600, SCIEX, USA). Quality control (QC) samples were made by pooling equal aliquots of each sample together in an analytical run. The QC sample was injected and analyzed at regular intervals of every 6 samples in UHPLC-QTOF MS acquisition. These QC sample data were used to monitor the reproducibility and stability of the analytes in samples during the analysis.
