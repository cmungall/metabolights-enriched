                "description": "<p>The protection of associated microbiota for their animal hosts against pathogen infection has been studied widely over the last 100 years. However, how those microbes protect the animal host is limitedly investigated. In former studies, body surface microbes of one insect, <em>Delia antiqua</em>, protect the insect larvae from infection with the entomopathogen <em>Beauveria bassiana</em>. By comparing the metabolites produced by microbes that protect the insect and microbes that cannot protect the insect, how the microbes protect the insect is answered. It turns out that body surface bacteria produce a metabolite cocktail that inhibit colonization of <em>B. bassiana</em>, and consequently protect the insect. This work reveals novel molecules that with antifungal activity, which may aid in discovery and expansion of new prophylactic and therapeutic natural chemicals for treating infectious diseases.</p>",

Briefly, the TripleTOF 5600 plus MS was used to detect metabolites eluted from the column in both positive and negative ion modes with the curtain gas set to 30 psi, ion source gas1 set to 60 psi, ion source gas2 set to 60 psi, and an interface heater temperature set to 650 \u00b0C. The ionspray floating voltage was set to 5000 V for positive ion mode and -4500 V for negative ion mode. The mass spectrometry data were acquired in IDA mode, and the TOF mass range was from 60 to 1200 Da. Ion survey scans were completed in 150 ms, and 12 product ions were collected if they exceeded a threshold of 100 counts/s and with a 1+ charge-state. The total cycle time was set to 0.56 s. 4 bins were summed during each scan at a pulser frequency of 11 kHz through the monitoring of the 40 GHz multichannel TDC detector with 4-anode/channel detection. Dynamic exclusion was set for 4 s. During mass spectrometry data acquisition, the mass accuracy was calibrated every 10 samples. Furthermore, to maintain the stability of the LC-MS system during the whole analysis, all samples from the 9 groups were analyzed in a random sequence, and a QC sample was analyzed every 10 samples.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Wang w, Gentu G, Zhou T, Chang C, Yin Q, Jia Y. 2019.

The intensities of each peak were calculated, and a three-dimensional matrix including arbitrarily assigned peak indices (retention time-m/z pairs), sample names (observations) and ion intensity information (variables) was generated. Online databases such as Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and the Human Metabolome Database (HMDB) were used to annotate the metabolites by comparing the molecular mass data (m/z) of samples with those from databases. Metabolites were annotated if the mass difference between the observed metabolite and the one from the database was less than 10 ppm. Furthermore, the molecular formula of metabolites was further identified and validated by the isotopic distribution measurements. In addition, an in-house fragment spectrum library of metabolites was used to validate the metabolite identification.</p><p><br></p><p>Principal components analysis (PCA) was performed for outlier detection and batch effects evaluation with the preprocessed dataset.
