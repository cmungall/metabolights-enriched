                "description": "Soybean (Glycine max (L.)) originated in China more than 5000 years ago, and the country is currently the third largest producer of soybeans in the world (Hymowitz et al., 2015). Based on a wild soybean Chromosome Segment Substitution Line (CSSL) population were constructed by crossing with the cultivar Suinong14 and ZYD00006 (the donor parent, a wild soybean variety) (Xin et al. 2016). A high-oil, low-protein (LPHO) and a high-protein, low-oil (HPLO) lines were screened out. In this study, a global interstitial microorganisms map were constructed, including Rhizosphere microorganisms, Phyllosphere microorganisms, Stem-interstitial microorganisms and interstitial microorganisms at the seeds developmental stage of early maturity stage (EM), mid-seed maturity stage (MM), late maturing stage (LM) and dry seed stage (DS). Whether the interstitial microorganisms may affect the growth of soybeans and the protein and oil content, as well as whether metabolites related to protein and oil content affect the surface and interior of soybeans in terms of beneficial microbial enrichment. To address these questions, we performed transcriptome sequencing, metabolomics, and microbial diversity analyses and examined significantly different microbial enrichment in LPHO/HPLO lines to screen out beneficial microbes associated with influencing soybean growth and affecting the protein and oil content. This finding will provide new ideas for further research on microorganisms affecting the protein and oil content of soybean seeds.",

The information in this 3D matrix included: sample information, metabolite name and mass spectral response intensity. Internal standard peaks, as well as any known false positive peaks (including noise, column bleed and derivatized reagent peaks), were removed from the data matrix, deredundant and peak pooled. At the same time, the metabolites were identified by searching database, and the main databases were the HMDB (http://www.hmdb.ca/), Metlin (https://metlin.scripps.edu/) and Majorbio Database. The data were analyzed through the free online platform of majorbio choud platform (cloud.majorbio.com). Metabolic features detected at least 80% in any set of samples were retained. After filtering, minimum metabolite values were imputed for specific samples in which the metabolite levels fell below the lower limit of quantitation, and each metabolic features were normalized by sum. To reduce the errors caused by sample preparation and instrument instability, the response intensity of the sample mass spectrum peaks was normalized by the sum normalization method, and then the normalized data matrix was obtained. Meanwhile, variables with relative standard deviation (RSD) &gt; 30% of QC samples were removed, and log10 processing was performed to obtain the final data matrix for subsequent analysis.</p>",

The metabolites with VIP &gt; 1, p &lt; 0.05 were determined as significantly different metabolites based on the Variable importance in the projeciton (VIP) obtained by the OPLS-DA model and the p-value generated by student\u2019s t test. Differential metabolites among 2 groups were mapped into their biochemical pathways through metabolic enrichment and pathway analysis based on KEGG database (http://www. genome.jp/kegg/). These metabolites could be classified according to the pathways they involved or the functions they performed. Enrichment analysis was used to analyze a group of metabolites in a function node whether appears or not. The principle was that the annotation analysis of a single metabolite develops into an annotation analysis of a group of metabolites. Python packages 'scipy.stats' (https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy) was used to perform enrichment analysis to obtain the most relevant biological pathways for experimental treatments.</p>",
