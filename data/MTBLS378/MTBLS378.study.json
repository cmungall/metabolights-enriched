                "description": "High-mass-resolution imaging mass spectrometry promises to localize hundreds of metabolites directly from tissues, cell cultures, and agar plates with cellular resolution, but is hampered by the lack of bioinformatics for automated metabolite identification. We developed the first bioinformatics framework for False Discovery Rate (FDR)-controlled metabolite annotation for high-mass-resolution imaging mass spectrometry (https://github.com/alexandrovteam/pySM) introducing a Metabolite-Signal Match (MSM) score and a target-decoy FDR-estimate for spatial metabolomics. LC-MS(/MS) datasets acquired from wild type adult mouse brain were used for the development of spatial metabolomics annotation bioinformatics. This study together with MTBLS317 and MTBLS378 provide the accompanying data for FDR-controlled metabolite annotation for high-resolution imaging mass spectrometry.",

                        "description": "LC-MS/MS validation of lipid annotations was performed differently for annotations when lipid standards are available and for other annotations. When lipid standards were available, LC-MS/MS information in particular the LC retention time (RT), MS and MS/MS (MS2) was used to compare the data from a standard with the data from a sample (both acquired using exactly the same LC-MS method and precursor selection range).\n</p>\nFirst, extracted ion chromatograms (XICs) were evaluated for all possible adducts to confirm the presence of the ion of the sum formula obtained from imaging data. As for the tolerance value for XICs: for data with standards we used the 5 ppm; for data with no standards we selected the best fitting tolerance value from 2, 3, and 5 ppm. We considered possible adducts for each metabolite (+H, +Na, +NH4 for the \u2018Positive\u2019 method; -H, +FA-H for the \u2018Negative\u2019 methods, FA stands for the formic acid) and selected the best matching adduct as follows. The precursor delta_m/z was calculated for the sample both in MS1 and MS/MS data. The matching MS/MS spectrum was searched within the elution profile and manually interpreted for fragments corresponding to head-group and fatty acid side chains. Only precursor and fragments with accuracy <6 ppm were considered for structural interpretation to identify possible lipid species. The lipid class was confirmed by the presence of head-group fragment or its neutral loss (e.g. MS/MS fragment with m/z 184.0735 corresponds to the phosphocholine head-group). Since lipids from the classes of phosphatidylcholines (PC) and sphingomyelins (SM) have the same head-group (m/z 184.0735), given a sum formula, we searched in HMDB and SwissLipids to rule out a possibility of the sum formula to correspond to a lipid from another class other than annotated by our framework. Further to confirm the fatty acid side chains, the \u2018Negative\u2019 LC-MS methods were used (e.g. fatty acid fragments for phosphocholines were obtained after fragmentation of formate ion precursors using the \u2018Negative\u2019 LC-MS method). The collision energy was selected as best representing the precursor and the expected fragments. When standards were available, the RT, precursor m/z and MS/MS fragments corresponding to head-groups and fatty acid chains from the sample were matched with spectra from the corresponding standard. When standards were not available the fragments were manually interpreted.\n</p>\nFinally, structural annotation of the matching peaks in the MS/MS spectra was performed with the help of the HighChem MassFrontier software (Thermo Scientific). The MS, MS/MS and RT (for standards) data is presented in Supplementary Notes 1, 2 and summarized in Table S5 of the associated paper.",
