                "description": "<p><strong>Background:</strong> Cell line specific, genome-scale metabolic models enable rigorous and systematic in silico investigation of cellular metabolism. Such models have recently become available for Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) too. However, a key ingredient, namely an experimentally validated biomass function that summarizes the cellular composition, was so far missing in all genome-scale metabolic models of CHO cell lines. Here, we close this gap by providing extensive experimental data on the biomass composition of 13 parental and producer CHO cell lines under various conditions.</p><p><strong>Results:</strong> We report protein, lipid, DNA, RNA and carbohydrate content, cell dry mass, and protein and lipid composition. Furthermore, we present meticulous data on exchange rates between cells and environment and provide detailed experimental protocols on how to determine all of the above. The biomass composition is converted into cell line and condition specific biomass functions for usage in cell line specific, genome-scale metabolic models of CHO. Finally, flux-balance analysis (FBA) is used to demonstrate consistency between in silico predictions and experimental analysis.</p><p><strong>Conclusions:</strong> Our study reveals a strong variability of the total protein content and cell dry mass across cell lines. Yet, the relative amino acid composition is independent of the cell lines and conditions and thus needs not be explicitly measured for each new cell line. In contrast, the lipid composition is strongly influenced by the growth media and needs to be determined for each case. These cell line specific variations in the biomass composition have a small impact on growth rate predictions with FBA, as inaccuracies in the predictions are typically dominated by inaccuracies in the exchange rate spectra. Cell specific biomass variations become only important if the experimental errors in the exchange rate spectra drop below twenty percent.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Links:</strong></p><p>All data and code for data processing are available at <a href='http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/g3wz7spyc9.1' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>Data Mendeley</a>.</p><p>Cell line specific metabolic models were deposited in <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/(Chelliah et al, 2014)' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>BioModels</a>, identifiers are listed in the study sample table.</p>",

Cultures were regularly checked for Mycoplasma contamination with MycoAlert-Mycoplasma Detection Kit (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland). The cell concentration, viability and cell diameter were measured with Vi-CELL XR (Beckman Coulter, CA, USA). The device was calibrated with ViaCheck-Concentration Control (Bangs Laboratories, Inc., IN, USA). The cell volume was calculated from the the cell diameter, assuming the cells have a spherical shape. All experiments were performed at passage 3-4 after thawing. To determine the duration of the exponential phase, batch cultures were run in triplicates at a working volume 100 mL in 250 mL flasks and three samples were taken per day in 6 h intervals for cell counting. Subsequently, batch cultures were run in 500 mL non-baffled Erlenmeyer shake flasks at a working volume of 200 mL. Three replicates were inoculated at one time point and another three 6 h later. During the exponential phase, samples were taken 3x per day in 6 h intervals for cell counting and extracellular metabolites, which covered 4 time points per day because of the time shift (except for batches K1par-8mMCD and K1par-0mMCD, which were done only in triplicates). Another three replicates were run for quantification of dry mass and biomass components. Cultures were monitored by cell counting and the biomass samples were taken at one time point in the mid-exponential phase. Afterwards, these cultures were finished because of the big volume reduction. 10^7 cells were taken for lipid quantification and approximately 1 mg for protein amino acid analysis (exact cell dry weights for each sample are specified in the Sample sheet). Cells were centrifuged at 200 x g for 8 min, washed with PBS and centrifuged again.

NanoESI chips with spraying nozzles of 5&nbsp;\u00b5m nominal internal diameter were used and the whole NanoMate was controlled by the Chipsoft 8.3.1 software (both Advion BioSciences).

Each sample was measured for 17 min and polarity switching was triggered after 8&nbsp;min (1 min afterwards for equilibration) via contact closure signal by the mass spectrometer. For each polarity, only MS1 spectra were acquired at the beginning for 30 s before 200 data independent acquisition (DIA) scans alternated with a MS1 scan for quantification. In MS1, the resolution was set to 240,000, the automatic gain control (AGC) target to 1e6 and the maximum injection time (IT) to 150&nbsp;ms. For the DIA scans, a resolution of 60000 was applied and the AGC target and the max IT was set to 2e^5 and 130&nbsp;ms, respectively.

                        "description": "<p><strong>Hydrolysis</strong></p><p>For subsequent protein amino acid analysis by GC-EI-MS/MS and LC-MS/MS cell pellets of all samples were hydrolyzed both with HCl combined with prior oxidation and with methanesulfonic acid (MSA). The CDW of the cell pellets used for hydrolysis is given in the Samples table (Cell dry weight (hydrolysis)). The samples were hydrolyzed in three Batches: B1, B2, B3. The number of the Batch in which samples were hydrolyzed and finally also analyzed is also given in the Samples tables (Batch number (hydrolysis)). The hydrolysate which was used for quantification of a specific amino acid (HCl or MSA) is stated in the protocol Metabolite Identification. During hydrolysis, glutamine is converted to glutamate and asparagine to aspartate, therefore these pairs are measured as a sum. Tryptophan is degraded in both hydrolysis methods and was hence not quantified. A detailed description of the hydrolysis methods is published previously<strong>[1]</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Derivatization</strong></p><p>For GC-MS/MS analysis the protein amino acids were just in time - online derivatized with N-(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)-N-methyltrifluoroacetamide with 1% tert-butyldimethylchlorosilane on an automated sample preparation system (MPS2, Gerstel). A detailed description of derivatization is published previously<strong>[1]</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Nagrath D, editor.
