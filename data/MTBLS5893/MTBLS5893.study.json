                "description": "<p>Harmful algal blooms (HABs) of the toxic haptophyte <em>Prymnesium parvum</em> are a recurrent problem in many inland and estuarine waters around the world. Strains of <em>P. parvum</em> vary in the toxins they produce and in other physiological traits associated with HABs, but the genetic basis for this variation is unknown. To investigate genome diversity in this morphospecies, we generated genome assemblies for 15 phylogenetically and geographically diverse strains of <em>P. parvum</em> including Hi-C guided, near-chromosome level assemblies for 2 strains. Comparative analysis revealed considerable DNA content variation between strains, ranging from 115 to 845 Mbp. Strains included haploids, diploids and polyploids, but not all differences in DNA content were due to variation in genome copy number. Haploid genome size between strains of different chemotypes differed by as much as 243 Mbp. Syntenic and phylogenetic analyses indicate that UTEX 2797, a common laboratory strain from Texas, is a hybrid that retains 2 phylogenetically distinct haplotypes. Investigation of gene families variably present across strains identified several functional categories associated with metabolic and genome size variation in <em>P. parvum</em> including genes for the biosynthesis of toxic metabolites and proliferation of transposable elements. Together, our results indicate that <em>P. parvum</em> is comprised of multiple cryptic species. These genomes provide a robust phylogenetic and genomic framework for investigations into the eco-physiological consequences of the intra- and inter-specific genetic variation present in <em>P. parvum</em> and demonstrate the need for similar resources for other HAB-forming morphospecies.</p>",

This media is dubbed L1-25. Strain&nbsp;P. parvum&nbsp;UTEX 2797 was obtained from the Culture Collection of Algae at the University of Texas at Austin (UTEX). Strains&nbsp;P. parvum&nbsp;12A1 and&nbsp;P. parvum 12B1 were kindly provided by Dr. William W. Driscoll<strong>[2]</strong>,&nbsp;and are available in from the UTEX Culture Collection of Algae. Strains were gradually transitioned to L1-25 from full-salinity L1 by a stepwise acclimatization of L1 in 65%, 50%, 25% salinity, over 2 weeks.&nbsp;P. parvum&nbsp;UTEX 2797 substrain 24p2B6 was isolated by the authors via limiting dilution of UTEX 2797 down to single cells in L1-25 in 384 well polypropylene (PP) plates.&nbsp;P. parvum&nbsp;strains UTEX 2797 24p2B6, 12A1, and 12B1 were grown at 20-22 \u00b0C under a 14:10 L:D cycle with ~40 \u00b5mol/photons/m^2/s light intensity (BR30 Full Spectrum LEDs, GE). For small scale experiments (doubling time) and general culture maintenance, cultures&nbsp;were grown in 50 mL L1-25 media in 125 mL Erlenmeyer flasks, sealed with a permeable paper.&nbsp;For large scale experiment (prymnesin extraction), an 0.55-1.4 L of L1-25 media within 2.8 L glass fernbach flasks without external aeration or shaking. A volumetric-rate calibrated flow cytometer (Guava Muse Cell Analyzer, Luminex) and cell detection via endogenous chlorophyll fluorescence (532 nm ex., 680 +/- 15 nm em.) was used for routine monitoring of cell concentration. Exponential phase culture from strains&nbsp;UTEX2797 24p2B6, 12A1, 12B1, CCMP 3036, CCMP 2941 and RCC 3703 (&gt;=100e^3 cells/mL, &lt;= 600e^3 cells/mL; late log phase)&nbsp;was harvested via filtration onto 47 mm glass fiber filters (GF/B, Whatman) using laboratory vacuum. The resulting filters were stored in 50 mL PP centrifuge tubes at -80 \u00b0C until extraction.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Svenssen DK, Binzer SB, Medi\u0107 N, Hansen PJ, Larsen TO, Varga E.

We rationalized that ethyl acetate pre-extraction may be a more reproducible alternative to cold acetone pre-extraction. Therefore, we first added 25 mL of ethyl acetate (EtOAc) to the 50 mL PP tubes with the collected biomass filters. The filter with EtOAc was shaken at 37 \u00b0C (220 RPM) for 20 min, and the resulting yellow-green extract was decanted and discarded. The remaining filter was washed with EtOAc 2-3 more times via the same method, until the resulting extract was without coloration. The final EtOAc extract was decanted and discarded, and the remaining droplets removed by briefly tapping the tubes upside-down on paper.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, 25 mL of methanol (MeOH) was added, and the tube was shaken at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min. Some brown coloration remained on the filter, despite the MeOH extraction, and could not be removed with further incubation or sonication. After centrifugation at 4000 x g for 10 min at 20 \u00b0C, the MeOH extract was decanted into a 25 mL pear-shaped flask (P/N 9477-06, Ace Glass) and rotary evaporated to dryness at 30 \u00b0C under reduced pressure (50 mbar, 150 RPM).&nbsp;&nbsp;The resulting residue was redissolved in 500 \u00b5L MeOH, yielding a light-yellow solution. Some insoluble residue was left within the flask.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Svenssen DK, Binzer SB, Medi\u0107 N, Hansen PJ, Larsen TO, Varga E.

In either case the instrument was quick tuned and mass calibrated just before use. The instrument was set to positive ionization mode. The source parameters were 300 \u00b0C gas temp, 11 L/min drying gas, nebulizer at 45 psig, source voltage at 4000 V, fragmentor at 100 V, Skimmer at 65 V, OCT 1 Rf Vpp at 750 V. N2 gas was supplied by a Parker NitroFlowLab N2&nbsp;generator at ~&gt;90% purity. The reference mass infusion and locking was disabled, due to an overlap with the PRYM aglycone [M+2H]2+&nbsp;isotopic peaks with the vendor supplied lock mass. The LC flow was diverted to waste from 0 to 6 min and MS acquisition was not performed. At 6 min, the LC flow was switched to the MS source and the instrument began acquiring MS1&nbsp;data from 125 to 3200&nbsp;m/z, at a rate of 4 spectra/s, in the auto MS2&nbsp;mode with a 250 ms dwell time per subsequent MS2&nbsp;scan. Between 1-3 of the most abundant precursors per MS1&nbsp;cycle were chosen for fragmentation, with dynamic exclusion of precursors after their selection. A fixed collision energy of 20 was used. All data was acquired in profile mode. At 43 min, the LC flow was switched back to waste &amp; MS acquisition stopped.&nbsp;</p>",

Coeluting [M+H]+, [M+2H]2+, and presumed aglycone in-source fragments, each showing the characteristic MS1&nbsp;pattern, were detected. These ionization phenomena are consistent with past reports<strong>[2]</strong>. We cannot rule out alternative prymnesins isobaric to the previously reported PRYM-1 and PRYM-2 (e.g., different sugars), therefore we propose these identifications as metabolite identification class D<strong>[3]</strong>, but overall are highly confident in their assignment as A-type prymnesins<strong>[4]</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Loos M, Gerber C, Corona F, Hollender J, Singer H.
