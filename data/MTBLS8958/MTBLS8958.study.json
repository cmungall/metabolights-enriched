                "description": "<p>This study aims to investigate the potential regulatory network responsible for the meat quality using multi-omics to help developing better varieties. Slaughter performance and meat quality of Shuxing No.1 rabbit outperformed Yila rabbit. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially abundance proteins (DAPs) were involved in meat quality-related pathways, such as PI3K-Akt and MAPK signaling pathway. Only SMTNL1 and PM20D2 shared between DEGs and DAPs. Olfactory-sensitive undecanal, a differentially abundant metabolite (DAM) in volatilomics (vDAMs), correlated with all of the remaining 11 vDAMs and most of 12 vDAMs were associated with amino acid metabolism. Integration revealed that 829 DEGs/DAPs were associated with 15 DAMs in four KEGG pathways, such as melatonin (a DAM in widely targeted metabolomics) was significantly positively correlated with ALDH and negatively correlated with RAB3D and CAT in tryptophan metabolism pathway. This study sheds light on the potential mechanisms that contribute to the improved meat quality and flavor.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>SPME-GC-MS assay</strong> is reported in the current study <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS8958' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS8958</strong></a>.</p><p><strong>UPLC-MS/MS assays</strong> are reported in <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS8957' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS8957</strong></a>.</p>",
