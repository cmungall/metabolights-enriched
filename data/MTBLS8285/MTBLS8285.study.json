                "description": "<p>Thoroughbred (TB) racehorses are subjected to rigorous conditioning programs involving exercise sessions of various types, distances and intensities. These programs aim to optimize both their physical and mental capabilities, which are essential to achieve maximal performance. Conventional investigations of exercise-induced metabolic responses typically focus on a limited set of targeted hematological and biochemical parameters. This field study was conducted to comprehensively assess the metabolic responses triggered by exercise sessions routinely used in TB conditioning. To accomplish this, we employed an untargeted metabolomics approach. Blood samples were collected from 10 racehorses at rest and after completing a routine exercise session. The population was subsequently divided into two groups based on the intensity of the exercise performed: a high-intensity group (n = 6, gallop at \u00b1 13.38 m/s, 1400 m) and a moderate-intensity group (n = 4, soft canter at \u00b1 7.63 m/s, 2500 m). The exercise intensity was evaluated through monitoring of speed, heart rate, and targeted hematological and biochemical parameters (e.g., lactatemia, hematocrit, etc). Resting and 30 min post-exercise plasma samples were analyzed using an untargeted metabolomics approach based on ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry. Unsupervised principal component analysis revealed changes in the metabolome from pre- to post-exercise samples with greater alterations following high-intensity exercise. 54 metabolites, mainly related to amino acid, fatty acid, nucleic acid and vitamin metabolism, were altered following high-intensity exercise versus 23 metabolites, mainly related to fatty acid and amino acid metabolism, following moderate-intensity exercise. Untargeted metabolomics complemented the routine biochemical analyses, allowing a more comprehensive exploration of the exercise-induced response to exercises used in routine conditioning. As previously reported by traditional biochemistry, exercise-induced changes in energy metabolism in TB racehorses have been confirmed. Through metabolomics, the involvement of lipid and amino acid metabolism during routine exercise and recovery has been highlighted, aspects that had previously been largely overlooked in Thoroughbred racehorses.</p>",

A total of 10 trained and ready to race TB flat racehorses in Chantilly (France) were included in the study.&nbsp;The recruited horses consisted of 6 mares and 4 geldings with an average age of 2.9 \u00b1 0.9 years and an average body condition score of 4.5 \u00b1 0.5 on the 9-point scale<strong>[1]</strong>. The horses had an average number of starts of 10.8 \u00b1 9.7. Population characteristics are displayed in <strong>Table S1</strong> in the paper associated with this study.</p><p><br></p><p>Horses followed an individualized conditioning protocol (6 days per week) designed by the trainer. Horses were housed in identical environmental conditions and received a similar diet. They were considered fit and ready to race by both, the trainer and the stable veterinarian. No abnormality was detected on the clinical examination performed on the day of the experiment. Horses had not raced within the previous 7 days. Horse 1 has been diagnosed with bilateral dorsal metacarpal disease within a few days after the study.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Exercise session monitoring and blood sample collection</strong></p><p>The experiment took place during a training session in December. The weather was overcast, with a temperature ranging between 5-8 \u00b0C, and humidity levels at 85%. Exercise sessions, consistent with each horse\u2019s regular program (i.e. usual riders, surfaces, distances, speeds, etc) were monitored using a heart rate (Polar, Finland) and global positioning system monitor (Waook Equi-Test, France). Exercise was not standardised and horses ran on various track surfaces. Two groups were constituted retrospectively according to the exercise intensity performed. Exercise intensity was classify based on the monitored heart rate, speed, distance run and post-exercise lactatemia as high-intensity exercise corresponding to a 'gallop' (Group 1, G1/Gint; n=6) and moderate-intensity exercise corresponding to a 'soft canter' according to the terminology of the discipline (Group 2, G2/Gmod; n=4).</p><p><br></p><p>Venous blood samples were collected in the morning at rest prior feeding (T0; approximately 6:00 AM), 5 min (T1), 30 min (T2) and 120 min (T3) after exercise via jugular venepuncture using a 20G needle and tube holder (BD Vacutainer, UK). No alcohol was used prior to blood collection. Vacuum blood collection tubes (BD Vacutainer, UK) included plain tubes for biochemistry analysis, lithium heparin tubes for untargeted metabolomics, ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) tubes for haematological analysis and sodium fluoride/potassium oxalate tubes for lactate measurement. The blood samples were centrifuged at room temperature. The plasma was centrifuged immediately after blood collection at 1000 x g, while the serum was centrifuged 1 h after collection at 3000 x g. The resulting serum and plasma were immediately frozen at -80 \u00b0C until analysis.</p><p><br></p><p>Untargeted metabolomics was performed in the laboratory LAB\u00c9O (Caen, France) using UPLC (1290 Infinity, Agilent Technologies, USA) coupled with mass spectrometry (6540 UHD Accurate-Mass Q-TOF, Agilent Technologies, USA). The untargeted metabolomics workflow used follows the protocol outlined in the study by Wouters and collaborators<strong>[2] </strong>who previously investigated equine plasma.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Henneke DR, Potter GD, Kreider JL, Yeates BF.

Raw data were converted to mzXML format using msConvert (version 3.0.18205, ProteoWizzard). The preprocessing was done on the Galaxy web interface using Workflow4metabolomics (version 22.05)<strong>[1][2]</strong>. The peak intensity matrix was generated after filtration, peak detection and grouping, and retention time correction using the XCMS R package (R version 4.1.2)<strong>[3]</strong>. Features eluted within the first 40 s (i.e. leftovers) and ions with a ratio lower than 1.5 between sample and blank were filtered out. Reproducibility of the analysis and reduction of noise were insured by these steps.</p><p><br></p><p>Extraction blanks were removed. Batch correction was performed using a locally quadratic (loess) regression model on the sample value to correct intensities for signal drift and batch-effect<strong>[4]</strong>. After QC samples were removed for analysis.</p><p><br></p><p>Missing values accounted for 18.48% and 24.4% of values for positive and negative ionisation modes, respectively. Missing values were imputed using the k-nearest neighbors 10 algorithm (knn-10)<strong>[5][6]</strong> to ensure robust statistical analysis. Normality of the data was improved after a log-10 transformed. The median intensity of biological triplicates was kept for each feature to reduce the analytical bias.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Unsupervised analysis</strong></p><p>The multilevel principal component analysis (PCA)<strong>[7]</strong> was performed using R Studio (version 4.1.2) on the median intensity of biological triplicates for each detected feature, utilizing samples from all horses (Gint and Gmod) taken before (pre) and after (post) exercise. Multilevel argument was used to take into account the repeated measurement on each horse, before and after exercise.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Feature selection</strong></p><p>Feature selection was performed separately for Gint and Gmod horses, using respective samples collected at rest and after exercise to assess metabolome modifications resulting from high-intensity exercise and moderate-intensity exercise.</p><p><br></p><p>The feature selection process was performed independently for both groups using the MetaboAnalyst (version 5.0)<strong>[8][9]</strong> web interface. The process included univariate (i.e. student paired t-test and fold change) and multivariate statistical analysis (i.e. Orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis [OPLS-DA], variable importance in prediction score [VIP]). The p-value corrected for multiple testing using the false discovery rate method (pFDR)<strong>[10]</strong>. In order to select features the most modified by exercise, features were selected based on one of the following criteria: a student paired t-test pFDR &lt; 0.05, a fold change (FC) \u2265 3 (up-regulated) or \u2264 1/3 (downregulated) or a VIP score &gt; 1.5.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Giacomoni F, Le Corguill\u00e9 G, Monsoor M, Landi M, Pericard P, P\u00e9t\u00e9ra M, Duperier C, Tremblay-Franco M, Martin JF, Jacob D, Goulitquer S, Th\u00e9venot EA, Caron C.
