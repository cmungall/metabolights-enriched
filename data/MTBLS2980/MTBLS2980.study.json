                "description": "During seed germination, desiccation tolerance is lost in the radicle with progressing radicle protrusion and seedling establishment. This process is accompanied by comprehensive changes of the metabolome and proteome. Germination of Arabidopsis seeds was investigated over 72 h with special focus on the heat-stable proteome including late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins together with changes of primary metabolites. Six metabolites in dry seeds known to be important for seed longevity decreased during germination and seedling establishment, while all other metabolites increased simultaneously with activation of growth and development. Thermo-stable proteins were associated with a multitude of biological processes. In the heat-stable proteome a relatively similar proportion of fully ordered and fully intrinsically disordered proteins (IDP) was discovered. Highly disordered proteins were found to be associated with functional categories development, protein, RNA and stress. As expected, the majority of LEA proteins decreased during germination and seedling establishment. However, four germination-specific dehydrins were identified, not present in dry seeds. A network analysis of proteins, metabolites and amino acids generated during the course of germination revealed a highly connected LEA protein network.",

After a week, plants were moved to a phytotron with a 8 h light period at a light intensity of 200 \u03bcmol/m^2/s, 20 \u00b0C, 60% RH and 16 \u00b0C during the 16 h night at 75% RH for another wk before pricking. After pricking plants were kept at these conditions for 2 additional wk to gain more leaf biomass before being transferred to long-day conditions in a greenhouse (16 h light at 21 \u00b0C, 8 h night at 19 \u00b0C and 50% RH during day and night) until seed harvest. Plants were bagged after siliques matured to minimize seed loss. After bagging, plants were left to dry for 2 wk in the greenhouse. Seeds were collected in the bags and stored in the dark at 15 \u00b0C/15% RH for 3 wk before they were used for experiments.</p><p><br></p><p>Samples for metabolomics, proteomics and transcript analysis were taken from dry seeds (DS), germinating seeds and young seedlings (24, 36, 48, 60 and 72 HAI). Seeds (except for DS) (75 mg of DS per replicate, 3-5 replicates per time point) were sterilized with 70% ethanol for 2 min, followed by 9% bleach solution containing 0.02% Triton X-100 for 17 min and 5 washings with sterile water. Seeds were then sown on blue germinating paper (grade 190, 300 g/m^2, Sartorius, G\u00f6ttingen, Germany) on agar plates containing half-strength MS medium without sucrose. Seeds on plates were stratified at 4 \u00b0C in the dark for 24 h before transfer to a growth chamber (22 \u00b0C, 16 h light period). Germinating seeds and seedlings were collected 24, 36, 48, 60 and 72 HAI by flash freezing with liquid nitrogen in a mortar. After homogenizing dry seed samples using mixer mill MM200 (Retsch, Haan, Germany) and germinating seeds and seedlings with mortar and pestle, fresh weight (FW) of the samples was determined before extractions for further analysis. Dry weight (DW) of samples was determined from 60 mg FW of plant material after drying overnight at 4 \u00b0C in a freeze dryer.</p>",

Prior to performing <strong>Principal Component Analysis</strong> (PCA) and Student\u2019s t-test, data imputation was performed if a metabolite was detected in three out of five and a protein or transcript was detected in two out of three replicates per time point. The imputation was performed using half the minimum value of either <strong>DW-normalized </strong>mass-spectral intensities (for metabolites), <strong>LFQ</strong> intensity (for heat-stable proteins) or <strong>DW-normalized-absolute copy number</strong> (for LEA transcripts). Analytes with more than 40% missing value at a time point were not considered for further evaluation. All data was log2-transformed and median-normalized for statistical analyses.</p><p><br></p><p>PCA was performed using the \u201c<strong>pcaMethods</strong>\u201d <strong>package version 1.74.0[7]</strong>. For PCA, missing values were replaced with 0 and mean values were Pareto-scaled and mean-centered using the probabilistic method. Abundance of analytes from DS to 72 HAI were shown in heat maps which illustrated the <strong>log2-median transformed mean</strong> of each analyte at each observed time point. Only the missing values in the heat map showing the abundance of all heat-stable proteins were replaced with 0 to allow clustering using Euclidean clustering on the heat map, otherwise the missing values remained. Clustering for other heat maps was performed based on the <strong>K-means</strong> clustering approach by excluding metabolites, proteins or transcripts with missing values from <strong>K-means</strong> clustering. Clusters were further characterized based on classes of metabolites, protein bins as assigned by <strong>MapMan[8]</strong>, and <strong>Pfam</strong> groups of LEA proteins<strong>[9]</strong>. <strong>Student\u2019s t-test</strong> was performed to test for significant differences between abundance at DS and subsequent time points. <strong>Pearson correlation</strong> tests were performed between the abundance of LEA proteins and their corresponding transcripts for those with protein and transcript detection from at least 4 of the 6 investigated time points. All <strong>p-values</strong> were adjusted using the <strong>Benjamini-Hochberg procedure[10]</strong> for false discovery rate correction. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Luedemann A, Strassburg K, Erban A, Kopka J.
