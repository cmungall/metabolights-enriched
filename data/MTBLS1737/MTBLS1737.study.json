                "description": "We conducted comprehensive (untargeted) metabolic profiling of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted in culture by bacterial taxa Francisella tularensis (F. tularensis) subspecies novicida and Bacillus anthracis (B. anthracis) Sterne, surrogates for potential bacterial bioterrorism agents, as well as selective measurements of VOCs from their fully virulent counterparts, F. tularensis subspecies tularensis strain SCHU S4 and B. anthracis Ames. F. tularensis and B. anthracis were grown in liquid broth for time periods that covered logarithmic growth, stationary, and decline phases. VOCs emitted over the course of the growth phases were collected from the headspace above the cultures using solid phase microextraction (SPME) and were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). We developed criteria for distinguishing VOCs originating from bacteria versus background VOCs (originating from growth media only controls or sampling devices). Analyses of collected VOCs revealed methyl ketones, alcohols, esters, carboxylic acids, and nitrogen- and sulfur-containing compounds that were present in the bacterial cultures and absent (or present at only low abundance) in control samples indicating that these compounds originated from the bacteria. Distinct VOC profiles where observed for F. tularensis when compared with B. anthracis while the observed profiles of each of the two F. tularensis and B. anthracis strains exhibited some similarities. Furthermore, the relative abundance of VOCs was influenced by bacterial growth phase. These data illustrate the potential for VOC profiles to distinguish pathogens at the genus and species-level and to discriminate bacterial growth phases. The determination of VOC profiles lays the groundwork for non-invasive probes of bacterial metabolism and offers prospects for detection of microbe-specific VOC biomarkers from two potential biowarfare agents.",

Ft novicida cultures were sampled at the following timepoints: 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 48, and 52 hr post-inoculation. Ba Sterne cultures were sampled at the following timepoints: 0, 4, 8, 12, 20, and 24 hr post-inoculation. At the time of sample collection, Erlenmeyer flasks were removed from the incubator-shaker and transferred to a biosafety cabinet. Headspace VOCs were immediately collected for 30 min on a field-portable 2 cm solid-phase microextraction (SPME) fiber with a 65 \u00b5m polydimethylsiloxane/divinylbenzene (PDMS/DVB) coating (Supelco, Bellefonte, PA) with no agitation of the flask. At each timepoint, one unexposed SPME fiber (fiber remaining retracted behind the septum in the SPME housing) was placed within the biosafety cabinet where the SPME sampling of cultures was taking place. These fibers served as 'travel blanks' to account for potential background volatiles leaking onto retracted fibers over time during storage or transportation to the GC-MS analysis laboratory. These 'travel blanks' were analyzed concurrently with fibers exposed to cultures. After collection, all SPME fibers were stored in refrigerators at 2-4 \u00b0C until analysis. Data acquisition on the GC-MS occurred within 3 weeks of collection.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Sampling VOCs from Bacterial Headspace (RG3 strains) and Transfer of SPME Samples to BSL-2 Facility:</strong></p><p>The VOC profiles of RG3 Ft SCHUS4 and Ba Ames as well as corresponding media controls were sampled at the following timepoints: 0, 6, and 24 hr post-inoculation. Timepoints were chosen to capture the exponential and stationary growth phase in each species. At the time of sample collection, Erlenmeyer flasks were removed from the incubator-shaker and transferred to a biosafety cabinet within the BSL-3 facility. Flasks were allowed to sit in the BSC for 30 min prior to sampling in order to allow any aerosols to settle. Headspace VOCs were collected for 30 min on SPME fibers with no agitation of the flask. After collection, SPME fiber devices were decontaminated by bleach wiping the entirety of their external housing for 1 min apiece, and residual bleach was removed via wiping. The process of bleach wiping to prevent accidental transfer of pathogens out of the BSL-3 facilities was tested and validated. The overall protocol was approved by the Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) at LLNL (see Supplemental Protocol in the paper associated with this study). SPME fibers were transferred from the BSL-3 to BSL-2 facilities and stored in refrigerators at 2-4 \u00b0C until analysis, as previously described. In analyzing the samples collected in the BSL-3 we did not find any indication that bleach wiping may have altered the compounds detected e.g. by introducing chlorinated compounds.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1] </strong>Reese KL, Fisher CL, Lane PD, Jaryenneh JD, Moorman MW, Jones AD, Frank M, Lane TW.

These programs enabled sophisticated organization of individual MS files into complex datasets for chemometric analyses.</p><p><br></p><p>Chromatographic deconvolution and visualization were performed using MassHunter Qualitative using a Retention Time window size factor of 90.0, signal-to-noise ratio threshold of 2.00, and absolute ion height filter of 1000 counts<strong>[1]</strong>. An arbitrary small value of 1 was assigned across all samples to the signal value for compounds that were not detected. Detected peaks were transferred into MPP and inter-aligned using a retention time tolerance of 0.15 minutes, mass spectral match factor of 0.6 (of maximum 1.0), and a delta m/z tolerance of 0.2 Da.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Reese KL, Fisher CL, Lane PD, Jaryenneh JD, Moorman MW, Jones AD, Frank M, Lane TW.
