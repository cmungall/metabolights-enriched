                "description": "Mass spectrometry-based untargeted lipidomics has revealed the lipidome atlas of living organisms at the molecular species level. Despite the double bond (C=C) position being a crucial factor for enzyme preference, cellular membrane milieu, and biological activity, the C=C defined structures have not yet been characterized. Here, we present a novel approach for C=C position-resolved untargeted lipidomics using a combination of oxygen attachment dissociation and computational mass spectrometry to increase the rate of annotation. We validated the accuracy of our platform as per the authentic standards of 21 lipid subclasses and the biogenic standards of 51 molecules containing polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) from the cultured cells fed with various fatty acid-enriched media. By analyzing human and mice-derived biological samples, we characterized 675 unique lipid structures with the C=C position-resolved level encompassing 22 lipid subclasses defined by LIPID MAPS. Our platform also illuminated the unique profiles of tissue-specific lipids containing n-3 and/or n-6 very long-chain PUFAs (carbon M 28 and double bonds a 4) in the eye, testis, and brain of the mouse.",

After the solvent was homogenized again under the same conditions, an appropriate amount of MeOH (30 mg tissue weight per 200 \u00b5L) was transferred to a 2-mL glass tube. After the solvent was removed up to 95% of the total volume of each sample, an appropriate amount of internal standards and CHCl3 (Table S10) were added to the solvent and vortexed for 10 s. After the solvent was incubated for 1 h on ice, 20 \u00b5L of Milli-Q water was added, and the mixture was vortexed for 10 s.

All analyses were performed in <strong>data-dependent acquisition</strong> (<strong>DDA</strong>) mode which can cover major adduct ions, e.g., [M+H]+, [M+NH4]+ and [M+Na]+ in positive ion mode with a mass range of 70-1250 m/z. The parameters were: MS1 accumulation time, 250 ms; CID-MS/MS accumulation time, 100 ms; OAD-MS/MS accumulation time, 500 ms; CID-MS/MS collision energy, 25 eV with an energy spread of 7 eV; OAD-MS/MS collision energy, 6 eV with an energy spread of 0 eV; nebulizer gas flow, 2 L/min; interface temperature, 300 \u00b0C; and interface voltage, +4.0 kV (positive) / -3.0 kV (negative). The other DDA parameters were dependent on the product ion scan number, 10; intensity threshold for CID-MS/MS, 1000 au; intensity threshold for OAD-MS/MS, 10,000 au; and exclusion time of precursor ion, 0 s. Mass calibration was automatically performed using a calibration delivery system (CDS) with a sub-interface. The experimental setup for OAD-MS/MS is described in detail elsewhere<strong>[1]</strong>. Briefly, O/OH was generated via the microwave discharge of water vapor. The generated O/OH was introduced into the collision cell (q2) of LCMS-9030. The quadrupole rods in q2 were heated to 150 \u00b0C to prevent surface oxidation of the electrodes due to O/OH.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Takahashi H, Shimabukuro Y, Asakawa D, Korenaga A, Yamada M, Iwamoto S, Wada M, Tanaka K.

The <strong>mzML</strong> data were preprocessed using the <strong>MS-DIAL</strong> software program (bootstrap version 4.38 and 4.80) for peak picking, MS/MS assignment, annotation in CID-MS/MS and peak alignment. The following parameters were set: (data collection) RT begin, 0 min; RT end, 18 min; mass range begin, 0 Da; mass range end, 2000 Da; MS1 tolerance, 0.01 Da; MS2 tolerance, 0.025 Da; (peak detection) minimum peak height, 300 amplitude; mass slice width, 0.1 Da; smoothing method, linear weighted moving average; smoothing level, 3 scan; minimum peak width, 5 scan; exclusion list, none; (deconvolution parameters) sigma window value, 0.5; MS/MS abundance cut off, 0 amplitude; (identification) RT tolerance, 2 min; MS1 accurate mass tolerance, 0.01 Da; MS2 mass tolerance, 0.05 Da; identification score cut-off, 70%; (text file and post identification) RT tolerance, 0.15 min; mass tolerance, 0.01 Da; identification score cut-off, 70%; (alignment) RT tolerance, 0.05 min; MS1 tolerance, 0.015 Da. The .<strong>mzML</strong> data of OAD-MS/MS were imported into <strong>MS-DIAL</strong>, where the <strong>MS-DIAL</strong> alignment results (.txt) were utilized as a text library to assign molecular species information to the OAD-MS/MS spectra of the same sample. The OAD-MS/MS spectra with molecular species information were exported in text format (.txt) from the <strong>MS-DIAL</strong> program, and the result was imported to the <strong>MS-RIDD</strong> software program, where the mass accuracy was set to 15 ppm and minimum intensity threshold for OAD diagnostic ions were set to 0.01, as %, and 0.005% for ?4 the sphingoid base, respectively. In this study, 14 fragment ions associated with a single double bond and related dehydrated ions were utilized as reference ions (Table S3). The detailed annotation algorithm is summarized in Figure S7. All annotation results from <strong>MS-RIDD </strong>were confirmed and collected by human verification.</p><p><br></p><p>The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of annotation (LOA) were evaluated as follows. The LOA value was defined as the minimum concentration in which the essential fragment ions to determine the double bond position are detected in the MS/MS spectrum. On the other hand, the minimum concentration where the chromatographic peak was detected by the peak picking algorithm of <strong>MS-DIAL</strong> was defined as the LOD value in this study because the cut-off value of signal to noise ratio in the peak picking algorithm is set as 3. Although the evaluation method of LOD does not follow the usual definition of limit of detection, we believe that the result gives a practical concentration whose peak is handled in our <strong>MS-DIAL</strong>/<strong>MS-RIDD</strong> software programs.</p><p><br></p><p>The source code of <strong>MS-RIDD</strong> was written in <strong>Python</strong> (version 3.7.3) using <strong>Pandas</strong> (version 0.24.2) for data curation, <strong>Matplotlib</strong> (version 3.0.3) for data visualization, <strong>Numpy</strong> (version 1.16.2) for statistical analysis, and <strong>openpyxl</strong> (version 2.6.1) and <strong>python-pptx</strong> (version 0.6.18) for exporting the results. Hierarchical clustering analysis was performed using <strong>Scipy</strong> (version 1.5.3). The data visualization for CID-/OAD-MS/MS spectra, extracted ion chromatograms, pairwise plots of retention time and m/z, heatmaps and bar charts were carried out using <strong>Matplotlib</strong> (version 3.0.3). The compound structure was drawn using <strong>MarvinSketch</strong> (version 20.20) from <strong>ChemAxon</strong>.
