                "description": "Left displaced abomasum (LDA) leads to substantial changes in the metabolism of dairy cows. Surgical correction of LDA can rapidly improve the health of cows; however, changes in metabolism following surgery are rarely described. To investigate the changes of plasma metabolome in cows with LDA before and after surgical correction, blood samples were collected from 10 healthy postpartum cows and 10 cows with LDA on the day of diagnosis, then again from the LDA cows 14 d after surgery. Serum nonesterified fatty acid, \u03b2-hydroxybutyric acid, cortisol and histamine concentration, and antioxidant enzyme (superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase) activities were evaluated, and the metabolic profile in plasma was analyzed using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The results demonstrated that cows with LDA experienced severe negative energy balance and oxidative stress, which can be improved by surgical correction. The metabolic profile was analyzed using multidimensional and univariate statistical analyses, and different metabolites were identified. In total, 102 metabolites differed between cows with LDA and healthy cows. After surgical correction, 65 metabolites changed in cows with LDA, compared with these cows during the LDA event. Following surgical correction, AA levels tended to increase, and lipid levels tended to decrease in cows with LDA. Pathway analysis indicated marked changes in linoleic acid metabolism, Arg biosynthesis, and Gly, Ser, and Thr metabolism in cows at the onset of LDA and following surgical correction. Surgical treatment reversed the changes in AA and lipid metabolism in cows with LDA.",

The experiment was performed at a dairy farm in Ziyang, Sichuan Province, China (with total herd stock of 2000 cows, including 1200 lactating cows) from December 2019 to March 2020 (averaged monthly incidence of LDA: 1.3%). We selected 10 clinically healthy postpartum dairy cows and 10 LDA cows with similar parity, age and DIM for use in the experiment. Cows with no fetid or mucopurulent uterine discharge, no clinical signs, no significant fluctuation in milk yield within a week, normal rumen fill (score \u22653) and BHB concentrations &lt;1.2 mmol/L were classified as healthy<strong>[1][2]</strong>. The diagnosis and surgical correction (left flank with ventral abomasum-omentopexy) of cows on the day of LDA diagnosis were performed as described previously<strong>[3]</strong>. All LDA cows underwent successful surgical treatment. The cows were housed in freestall barns and provided free access to freshwater. Cows were milked daily at 0630, 1200 and 1930 h. A TMR diet was given 3 times daily. The ingredients and chemical composition of the TMR diet are shown in <strong>Table S2</strong> in the paper associated with this study. The LDA diagnosis and sample collection were carried out before feeding.</p><p><br></p><p>Blood samples were collected via the caudal vein on the day of LDA diagnosis (LDA-0) and day of surgery from both the LDA cows and healthy cows. Then 2 weeks after LDA surgery (LDA-14), blood samples were recollected from the LDA cows. At each blood sampling moment, both a plasma and a serum sample were collected. Serum was collected by centrifugation at 1500 x g for 10 min at room temperature, and plasma was obtained using sodium citrate as an anticoagulant, followed by centrifugation at 1500 x g for 10 min at room temperature. All samples were stored at -80 \u00b0C. The UHPLC-TOF-MS was performed by Shanghai Applied Protein Technology Co. Ltd. The sample pretreatment, conditions and equipment parameters used for metabolic profiling were consistent with those in our previous report<strong>[4]</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Oetzel GR.

Ion peak data of which &gt; 50% of the data were missing within a group were deleted. The data were pre-processed by pareto-scaling, after which pattern recognition was performed using <strong>SIMCA-P</strong> software (version 14.1, Umetrics, Umea, Sweden). Analysis of the differences between groups (healthy vs LDA-0 groups; LDA-0 vs LDA-14 groups) was performed using principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA). The PCA results revealed differences between samples within groups and between groups. We used OPLS-DA to identify differences between groups, and model parameters R2Y (interpretation of variation in Y) and Q2 (based on the predictive ability of 200 interaction validation and permutation tests) were used to evaluate model quality. The R2Y and Q2 values of &gt;0.4 indicated that the model was stable and reliable<strong>[2][3]</strong>. Univariate analysis was also performed using fold change analysis and Student's t-test. Enrichment pathway analysis and pathway impact analysis of metabolites that differed among groups were performed using <strong>MetaboAnalyst</strong> 4.0 (<a href='https://www.metaboanalyst.ca/' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>https://www.metaboanalyst.ca/</a>).

Briefly, identification of differential metabolites was carried out by searching an in-house standard MS/MS library and the online database <strong>METLIN</strong> using MS/MS spectra or exact mass data. The in-house library contains MS/MS spectra of approximately 800 compounds, which were obtained from standards. The MS/MS spectra matching score was calculated using the dot-product algorithm and the score cutoff was set as 0.8. The MS/MS spectra that could not be matched to any of those in the in-house library were searched in online databases.
