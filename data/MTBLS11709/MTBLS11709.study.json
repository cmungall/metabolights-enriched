                "description": "Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and the formation of Lewy bodies that are composed of aggregated \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-Syn). However, the factors that regulate \u03b1-Syn pathology and nigrostriatal dopaminergic degeneration remain poorly understood. Previous studies demonstrate cholesterol 24-hydroxylase (CYP46A1) increases the risk for PD. Moreover, 24-hydroxycholesterol (24-OHC), a brain-specific oxysterol that is catalyzed by CYP46A1, is elevated in the cerebrospinal fluid of PD patients. Herein, we show that the levels of CYP46A1 and 24-OHC are elevated in PD patients and increase with age in a mouse model. Overexpression of CYP46A1 intensifies \u03b1-Syn pathology, whereas genetic removal of CYP46A1 attenuates \u03b1-Syn neurotoxicity and nigrostriatal dopaminergic degeneration in the brain. Moreover, supplementation with exogenous 24-OHC exacerbates the mitochondrial dysfunction induced by \u03b1-Syn fibrils. Intracerebral injection of 24-OHC enhances the spread of \u03b1-Syn pathology and dopaminergic neurodegeneration via elevated X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) and lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG3) levels. Thus, elevated CYP46A1 and 24-OHC promote neurotoxicity and the spread of \u03b1-Syn via the XBP1\u2012LAG3 axis. Strategies aimed at inhibiting the CYP46A1-24-OHC axis and LAG3 could hold promise as disease-modifying therapies for PD.",

At 6 months of age, the mice were anesthetized using isoflurane (or specify other anesthesia if applicable) and cardiac perfusion was performed with ice-cold PBS (30 mL per mouse, at a controlled flow rate of 10 mL/min). Immediately after perfusion, the brain tissue was dissected on ice, and the striatum was carefully isolated using a stereotaxic atlas to ensure accuracy. The striatal tissues were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80\u00b0C until further analysis.

The chromatographic separation was achieved using an ACQUITY UPLC BEH C18 column (2.1 \u00d7 100 mm, 1.7 \u03bcm). The mobile phase consisted of two components: A (acetonitrile:water, 6:4, v/v, with 10 mM ammonium formate) and B (isopropyl alcohol:acetonitrile, 9:1, v/v, with 10 mM ammonium formate). The column temperature was maintained at 50 \u00b0C, and the flow rate was set at 0.3 mL/min. The injection volume was 1 \u03bcL, with the automatic injector temperature set to 4 \u00b0C. The gradient elution program started with 70% A and 30% B, held for 1 minute, then decreased to 0% A and 100% B at 10.5 minutes, held for 2 minutes, and finally returned to 70% A and 30% B by 12.51 minutes, holding until 16 minutes.</p>",

In positive ion mode (ESI+), the heater temperature was set to 300 \u00b0C, sheath gas flow rate to 45 arb, aux gas flow rate to 15 arb, and sweep gas flow rate to 1 arb. The spray voltage was 3.0 kV, and the capillary temperature was maintained at 350 \u00b0C, with an S-Lens RF Level of 30%. In negative ion mode (ESI-), the heater temperature remained at 300 \u00b0C, while the spray voltage was increased to 3.2 kV and the S-Lens RF Level was set to 60%. The scan mode included full scan (m/z 200\u20131200) and data-dependent MS2 (TopN = 10) with a resolution of 70,000 for MS1 and 17,500 for MS2.
