                "description": "The effects of the antimicrobial triclosan (TCS) and its transformation product methyl-triclosan (MTCS) on the earthworm Eisenia fetida were investigated using GC-MS metabolomics. TCS is ubiquitous in sewage sludge, but a large proportion is transformed into MTCS during wastewater treatment and in soil when sewage sludge is applied to land. Our objective was to determine if earthworms exposed to ng/g to \u03bcg/g concentrations of TCS or MTCS exhibit toxic effects, and to identify the toxic mode of action of each compound. Ten individual earthworm replicates in 10 g worm bedding were exposed to 0, 0.25, 1, 4, 16, or 64 \u03bcg/g of either TCS or MTCS (120 experimental units) for 14 days. No mortalities were observed. All MTCS exposed worms had an instantaneous growth rate (IGR) over two times higher than the control during the study, but there was no effect of increasing concentration. Succinic acid was elevated relative to the control at concentrations \u2265 0.25 \u03bcg/g and glucose was elevated at 1 \u03bcg/g. There was separation from the control at all concentrations except 4 \u03bcg/g using Principal Components Analysis. Glucose, palmitic acid, and IGR contributed most strongly to the separation. Discriminant analysis with succinic acid, glucose, and IGR as variables showed a clear separation at all concentrations from the control along Canonical 1. Disruption of energy metabolism was hypothesized as a possible mode of action for MTCS.",

Commercially available Magic\u00ae worm bedding (Magic Products Inc., Amherst\nJunction, WI) was used for the experiments. Earthworms were fed weekly on a diet of milled corn to supplement the compost, and the bin was misted with non-chlorinated well water at regular intervals. Adult earthworms between 0.4 to 0.6 g wet weight and with a visible clitellum were sampled from the bulk population immediately prior to the experiment.\n</p>\nA 2x6 factorial design with 10 replicates was established for the study. A single E. fetida earthworm was placed in a 100 ml vial with 10 g d.w. Magic\u00ae Worm Bedding (Magic Products Inc., Amherst Junction, WI) spiked with 0, 0.25, 1, 4, 16, or 64 \u03bcg/g d.w. of either TCS or MTCS. The spiking rate of 0.25 \u03bcg/g represents an initial soil concentration resulting from a high rate of biosolids application (40 Mg/ha), incorporated into the top 20 cm of soil with a bulk density of 1500 kg/m^3, and concentrations in biosolids of 20 \u03bcg/g d.w (typical TCS range is 1-20 \u03bcg/g). The 1, 4, and 16 \u03bcg/g treatments reflect the typical range of TCS concentrations in biosolids. Prior to introduction of the earthworms, compounds dissolved in 1 ml of acetone were spiked into 10 g of worm bedding on aluminum dishes, stirred to mix thoroughly, and evaporated to dryness in a fume hood. The spiked worm bedding was transferred to the vial, moistened with 20 ml of distilled water, and equilibrated for 24 hr. Earthworms were collected from the maintained population, gently rinsed with distilled water and dried to remove extraneous organic matter, weighed, and randomly assigned to an experimental vessel. The earthworms were removed after 14 days, gently rinsed to remove organic matter, weighed, and subsequently immersed in liquid N2 to quench further metabolic activity and preserve the samples.",

Detected peaks were aligned across all samples and examined to ensure there were no missing values and that all peaks were properly aligned. If there were problems in detection or alignment, the peak detection or alignment parameters were adjusted as necessary to correct the issue. Complete and properly aligned peak lists were exported to *.csv format for further processing and analysis.\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Wenig P and Odermatt J.

All metabolites were therefore classified as Level 1 identified compounds according the Metabolomics Standards Initiative guidelines[1].
