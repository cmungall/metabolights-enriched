                "description": "<p>The relationship among the gut microbiome, global fecal metabolites and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has not been systematically evaluated. In this study, we performed 16S rDNA sequencing and&nbsp;liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry&nbsp;(LC-MS/MS)-based nontargeted metabolomic profiling on feces of 26 untreated&nbsp;RA patients&nbsp;and 26 healthy controls. Twenty-six genera and forty-one MS2-identified metabolites were significantly altered in the RA patients. Klebsiella, Escherichia, Eisenbergiella and Flavobacterium were more abundant in the RA patients, while Fusicatenibacter, Megamonas and Enterococcus were more abundant in the healthy controls. Function prediction analysis demonstrated that the biosynthesis pathways of amino acids,&nbsp;such as L-arginine and aromatic amino acids,&nbsp;were depleted in the RA group. In the metabolome results, fecal metabolites including&nbsp;glycerophospholipids (PC(18:3(9Z,12Z,15Z)/16:1(9Z)), lysoPE(19:1), lysoPE(18:0), lysoPC(18:0/0:0)), sphingolipids (Cer(d18:0/16:0), Cer(d18:0/12:0), Cer(d18:0/14:0)),&nbsp;kynurenic acid, xanthurenic acid and 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid were remarkably altered between the RA patients and healthy controls. Dysregulation of pathways, such as tryptophan metabolism, alpha-linolenic acid metabolism and glycerophospholipid metabolism, may contribute to the development of RA.&nbsp;Additionally, we revealed that the gut microbiome and metabolites were interrelated in the RA patients, while&nbsp;Escherichia was the core genus.&nbsp;By depicting the overall landscape of the intestinal microbiome and metabolome in RA patients, our study could provide possible novel research directions regarding RA pathogenesis and targeted therapy.</p>",

For positive ion mode, the Ionspray voltage floating were set at 5000 V. For negative ion mode, the Ionspray voltage floating were set at \u20104500 V. The mass spectrometry data were acquired in Information Dependent Acquisition mode (IDA) aka Data-Dependent acquisition (DDA) mode. The TOF mass range was from 60 to 1200 Da. The survey scans were acquired in 150 ms and as many as 12 product ion scans were collected if exceeding a threshold of 100 counts/s and with a +1 charge state. The total cycle time was fixed to 0.56 s. Altogether 4 time bins were summed for each scan at a pulser frequency value of 11 kHz through monitoring of the 40 GHz multichannel TDC detector with 4 anode/channel detection. Dynamic exclusion was set for 4 s. During the acquisition, the mass accuracy was calibrated every 20 samples. Furthermore, in order to evaluate the stability of the LC-MS during the whole acquisition, a quality control sample (pool of all samples) was acquired after every 10 samples.</p>",
