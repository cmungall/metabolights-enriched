                "description": "Today's high-resolution mass spectrometers (HRMS) allow bioanalysts to perform untargeted/global determinations that can reveal unexpected compounds or concentrations in a patient&rsquo;s sample. This could be performed for preliminary diagnosis attempts when usual diagnostic processes and targeted determinations fail. We have evaluated an untargeted diagnostic screening (UDS) procedure. UDS is a metabolome analysis that compares one sample (e.g., a patient) with control samples (a healthy population). Using liquid chromatography (LC)-HRMS full-scan analysis of human serum extracts and unsupervised data treatment, we have compared individual samples that were spiked with one xenobiotic or a higher level of one endogenous compound with control samples. After the use of different filters that drastically reduced the number of metabolites detected, the spiked compound was eventually revealed in each test sample and ranked. The proposed UDS procedure appears feasible and reliable to reveal unexpected xenobiotics (toxicology) or higher concentrations of endogenous metabolites. HRMS-based untargeted approaches could be useful as preliminary diagnostic screening when canonical processes do not reveal disease etiology nor establish a clear diagnosis and could reduce misdiagnosis. On the other hand, the risk of overdiagnosis of this approach should be reduced with mandatory biomedical interpretation of the patient&rsquo;s UDS results and with confirmatory targeted and quantitative determinations.",

The chromatographic system consisted of an LC pump (Rheos-Allegro, Flux, Basel, Switzerland), an autosampler (CTC Analytics AG, Zwingen, Switzerland) maintaining injection vials at 10 \u00b0C, and a Q-Exactive Focus HRMS (Thermo, Waltham, MA, USA) controlled by Xcalibur (Thermo, Waltham, MA, USA). Extracts were injected onto BEH C18 guard and analytical columns (Waters, Milford, MA, USA), 10 and 30 mm x 2.1 mm (L x i.d.) with 1.7 \u00b5m part. size. The mobile phase was composed of MS grade (A) water and (B) acetonitrile, both with 0.1% FA and delivered at 0.6 ml/min. The stepwise gradient was delivered as follows: 0\u20130.5 min, 95% of phase A; 0.5\u201310 min, 95\u20135% of phase A; 10\u201312 min, 5\u20132% of phase A; and 12\u201315 min, 95% of phase A for a 15 min total run time.<br><br>The metabolome of 1 test sample (containing the spiked molecule and considered as the patient's sample) was compared with healthy metabolomes of the control group. Test samples were injected in triplicate (N = 3) and compared with 2 types of control samples: (1) a pool sample (Pool) prepared from 25 different individuals and injected in triplicate (N = 3) or (2) 95 unpooled samples (N95) prepared from 95 different individuals and injected once each (N = 95; 95 single injections) (see Fig. 2 in the paper associated with this study). Control samples were injected between each test sample. Memory effect was verified with blank samples and remained below ~2%.<br>",

Extracted-ion chromatograms, XIC, were constructed using Xcalibur and used a mass-extraction window set at \u00b110 ppm, centered on the theoretical m/z (m/ztheor) or, for unknown ions, on measured m/z (m/zmeas). Metabolite LC-HRMS peak areas found with Progenesis or Xcalibur were compared. Raw files were imported from Xcalibur to Progenesis software with a filter strength set at 1.0 (default value). Then, features were automatically (1) aligned, (2). picked with 'default' Progenesis detection settings and peak widths set at \u22650.04 min, (3) Normalized, and (4) grouped (deconvolution) based on the following adducts: +[H2O+H+]+, +[H+]+, +[2H+]2+, +[NH4+]+, +[Na+]+, and +[K+]+ or \u2212[H+]\u2212, \u2212[H2O-H+]\u2212, \u2212[2H+]2\u2212 for positive or negative mode. Positive or negative data were treated separately. Raw peak areas were normalized by the sum of all feature peak areas following one classical Progenesis procedure. For each sample, peak alignment and area normalization were verified by looking at their associated Progenesis values. Progenesis software compared a test sample (triplicate injections) with Pool or N95 control samples (triplicate or simplicate injections, respectively). Thus, the Progenesis study design compared 3 versus 3 or 3 versus 95 samples (see see Fig. 2 from the paper associated with this study). See Fig. S1 from the paper associated with this study, for a comprehensive data processing representation.<br>",

Only specific adducts (see Section 2.3 Data Representation and Data Treatment in the paper associated with this study) with a mass accuracy of \u2264\u00b15 ppm were allowed to return possible compounds. Therefore, only known-unknown metabolites from a 'small size' database, HMDB, were considered (&lt;0.5 x 10^6 entries like Metlin or KEGG databases[2][3]). Big databases (&gt;50 x 10^6 entries), such as ChemSpider, PubChem, CAS registry, etc.[4-6], were not considered here because most compounds registered in these big databases have an extremely low probability to be found in human plasma[7]. Identification confidence of the putatively identified known-unknown metabolites was evaluated based on a recent publication that proposes the use of an identification (ID) confidence scale and ID score[7]. These ID scores are based on a relative retention time or not, and the collection of ID points from various criteria such as mass accuracy, relative isotopic abundance, fragment ions, fine isotopic distribution, etc.[7].<br><br>Ref:<br>[1] Wishart DS, Jewison T, Guo AC, Wilson M, Knox C, Liu Y, Djoumbou Y, Mandal R, Aziat F, Dong E, Bouatra S, Sinelnikov I, Arndt D, Xia J, Liu P, Yallou F, Bjorndahl T, Perez-Pineiro R, Eisner R, Allen F, Neveu V, Greiner R, Scalbert A.
