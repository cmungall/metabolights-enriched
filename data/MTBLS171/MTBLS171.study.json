                "description": "GC-MS is a commonly used metabolomic platform for the analysis of urine. A key step in the preparation of samples for GC-MS is derivatisation, in particular, methoximation and trimethylsilylation. This paper presents an assessment of automated derivatisation protocols for GC-MS-based untargeted metabolomic analysis of rat urine. Automated batch and in-time (a sample ready for injection every 70 minutes) derivatisation protocols were tested using BSTFA and MSTFA. Principal component analysis determined differences based upon protocol tested (PC-1; 19%) and silylation reagent (PC-2; 17%) used. Of 249 compounds, 40 compounds were significantly different (P<0.05) based upon reagent and 154 compounds were significantly different (P<0.05) based upon protocol. A key outcome of this study was the demonstrated effects of derivatisation including reagent and protocol (i.e. reaction duration, temperature and mixing speed) on individual urinary metabolites. It is hoped that the current work will provide a reference on which to base future GC-MS-based untargeted and targeted metabolomic analyses of urine.",

Samples were incubated for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C and then centrifuged for 10 min at 1,500 \u00d7 g. Chilled (approx. -20 \u00b0C) methanol containing uniformly labelled 13C,15N-valine and 13C-sorbitol as internal standards (200 \u00b5l; 29.25 \u00b5g/ml) was added to the sample. Samples were agitated for 10 min at 1,200 rpm and subsequently centrifuged for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C and 13,400 \u00d7 g. Aliquots (50 \u00b5l) of the sample were transferred to 200 \u00b5l glass inserts (for 2 ml GC vials) and dried in an Eppendorf Concentrator Plus rotary vacuum concentrator (Eppendorf South Pacific Pty. Ltd., North Ryde, NSW, Australia). The dried extract was stored at -80 \u00b0C for approximately 2 weeks (15 days) until derivatization and analysis.\n</p>\nFor the control protocol, metabolites were treated with 20 \u00b5l of methoxyamine-HCl (20 mg/ml in pyridine) and agitated for 90 min at 1,200 rpm and 30 \u00b0C in an Eppendorf Thermomixer Comfort. Following this, 40 \u00b5l of BSTFA or MSTFA was added and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min at 300 rpm in the thermomixer.  5 \u00b5l of an alkane mix (C10, C12, C15, C19, C22, C28; 0.156 mg/ml; C32, C36; 0.313 mg/ml) in hexane was added to the final sample for the calculation of a Kovat\u2019s Retention Index for each compound. For automated protocols (batch and in-time), reagents (methoxyamine-HCl, BSTFA or MSTFA, n-alkanes) were added using a CTC CombiPAL autosampler (CTC Analytics, Zwingen, Switzerland) with an agitator and equipped with a gas tight, cone tip 25 \u00b5l syringe (SGE, Ringwood, Victoria, Australia). Automated procedures were kept the same as the control with the exception that 500 rpm (maximum setting) was used for both automated procedures and a temperature of 37 \u00b0C for both methoximation and trimethylsilylation was used for the automated in-time protocol as there was only one agitator. The automated batch protocol prepared a batch of samples and the automated in-time procedure used a staggered approach resulting in a sample being ready for immediate injection every 70 min.\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Abbiss H, Maker GL, Gummer J, Sharman MJ, Phillips JK, Boyce M, Trengove RD.

The Ruby scripting program was used to align common chromatographic peaks as described in Gummer et al.[1]. Following this, manual alignment of data was required to align peaks of the same compound which had deconvoluted differently in different samples. Peaks which occurred in <10% of the samples were removed from subsequent analyses. Unless otherwise stated, peak area (x) was log transformed using the equation x=log10(x+1) for further analysis. Principal component analysis was conducted using The Unscrambler X v10.1 (CAMO, Oslo, Norway). All metabolites were assessed for statistical significance using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS v22). Where data were normally distributed (determined by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) and variance was homogenous (determined by Levene\u2019s test), two-way ANOVA was used to determine the effects of reagent and protocol on 1) number of deconvoluted peaks; and 2) total ion chromatogram (TIC) area. A one-way ANOVA was used to determine the effects of 1) reagent and 2) protocol on metabolite peak area. Where data were non-normal and/or variance was heterogeneous the Mann-Whitney U-test or Kruskal-Wallis test were used. Main effects were analysed using Bonferroni post hoc correction for multiple comparisons. Spearman\u2019s correlation coefficient was employed to determine significant correlations between the internal standard and total ion chromatogram area where appropriate. A 0.05 criterion of statistical significance and 95% confidence interval were employed for all tests.\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Gummer JP, Trengove RD, Oliver RP, Solomon PS.

Putative identifications were made by comparing mass spectra with a user-generated library of metabolite standards (Metabolomics Australia, Murdoch University Node) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 2011 MS Search v2.0 library. Where compounds were identified using only the NIST library, identifications were made with confidence scores >70% and probability scores >20% (>70% of IDs were made with probability scores >50%). Identifications were made for all compounds where possible and assigned an identification level as per Sumner et al.[1] and score as per Sumner et al.[2]. A revised score has been proposed to include a score for a match to an authentic standard (+1.5) and compound class match (+0.5).\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Sumner LW, Amberg A, Barrett D, Beale MH, Beger R, Daykin CA, Fan TW, Fiehn O, Goodacre R, Griffin JL, Hankemeier T, Hardy N, Harnly J, Higashi R, Kopka J, Lane AN, Lindon JC, Marriott P, Nicholls AW, Reily MD, Thaden JJ, Viant MR.
