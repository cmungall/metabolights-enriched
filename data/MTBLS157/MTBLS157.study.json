                "description": "Microbial alteration and remineralization of organic matter in the ocean play essential roles in the carbon cycle. The impact of individual compounds as either growth substrates or infochemicals is still poorly constrained in models, particularly for organisms with relatively versatile genomes. Here, we use metabolomics techniques to characterize the response of a heterotrophic marine bacterium, Ruegeria pomeroyi DSS-3, to growth on the abundant algal metabolite dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP). DMSP is a valuable source of reduced carbon and sulfur as well as a chemo-attractant. It is present at higher concentrations during phytoplankton blooms. When cultivated on DMSP, R. pomeroyi synthesized a quorum sensing molecule, N-(3-oxotetradecanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone, which was not synthesized at the same levels during growth on propionate, another carbon substrate. More broadly, we observed differential production of intra- and extracellular metabolites with implications for nitrogen assimilation and microbial cross-feeding. This multi-faceted response suggests that R. pomeroyi uses a two-component regulatory system dependent on the presence of DMSP and high cell densities to activate a suite of metabolic changes that may shape how it accesses nutrients and impacts the surrounding microbial consortium.",

                        "description": "Ruegeria pomeroyi DSS-3 [DSM 15171] was purchased from ATCC (Catalog number 700808). The bacteria were grown in 250 ml Erlenmeyer flasks with glass wool in the neck in the dark at 23 \u02daC. At each time point two duplicate flasks were sacrificed for both treatments. Media blanks ('cell-free controls') for each substrate were extracted at 0, 40, and 72 hours. The defined media (total volume = 120 ml) was made with 0.2 \u03bcm-filtered seawater collected near high tide from Vineyard Sound (Massachusetts) in September 2013. Nutrients and carbon substrates were added to the media in the concentrations in the following concentrations:\nSodium propionate(1 mM = 3 mM C), dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP, 0.6 mM = 3 mM C), NH4Cl (6 g/25 ml), NaH2PO4 (36.2 mM), f/2 Vitamins Solution (2.34 ml added for 2.34 l of media), FeCl2-EDTA (0.1 M), ZnCl2 (0.001 M), MnCl2 (0.001 M), CoCl2 (0.1 mM).\n</p>\nThe experimental samples were inoculated with exponentially-growing R. pomeroyi that had been pre-conditioned in the target media (two transfers). Cultures were sacrificed at 0, 32, 38(p)/43(d), 48, 60, and 72 hours. The third time point was offset between the propionate and DMSP treatments so that the same cell abundance was sampled in each treatment. These time points captured exponential and stationary growth phases in both experiments. Each culture was filtered through a 0.2 \u00b5m filter (Omnipore, EMD Millipore) using a glass vacuum filtration rig.",

Subsequently, three quarters of each filter was weighed and cut into small pieces with methanol rinsed scissors on combusted aluminum foil. The pieces of the filter were placed in an 8 ml combusted amber glass vial and 1 ml of -20 \u00b0C 40:40:20 acetonitrile:methanol:water + 0.1 M formic acid was added to each vial. 25 \u00b5l of 1 \u00b5g/ml deuterated standard mix (d3-glutamic acid, d4-4-hydroxybenzoic acid, and d5-taurocholate) were added to act as extraction recovery standards. The vials were vortexed to shake apart filter pieces and fully expose them to the ice-cold solvent. They were sonicated for 10 minutes and the extract was transferred to micro-centrifuge tubes using Pasteur pipettes. The filter pieces were rinsed with 200 \u00b5l of extraction solvent and the rinse was added to the eppendorf tubes as well. The extracts were centrifuged at 20,000 \u00d7 g for 5 minutes. The supernatant was transferred to new 8 ml amber glass vials leaving behind any scraps of filter or pieces of cellular detritus. The extracts were neutralized with 26 \u00b5l of 6 M ammonium hydroxide and dried down in a vacufuge. The samples were reconstituted in 495 \u00b5l 95:5 water:acetonitrile and 5 \u00b5l of 5 \u00b5g/ml deuterated biotin (injection standard). The solution (100 \u00b5l) was placed in a glass insert in an autosampler vial for targeted metabolomic analysis. From this same solution 250 \u00b5l was removed and placed in a new vial, dried down, and brought up 500 \u00b5l 0.01 M HCl. The solution was pulled through a 50 mg Varian PPL cartridge that was pre-rinsed with 1 ml methanol. The cartridge was rinsed with 2 ml 0.01 M HCl, dried for five minutes by pulling air through the cartridge, and then the sample was eluted from the cartridge with 1 ml methanol. The samples were dried down in a vacufuge and reconstituted in 250 \u00b5l of 95:5 water:acetonitrile for untargeted analysis.\n</p>\nExtracellular Metabolite Extraction\nThe media filtrate was acidified to pH 2-3 with 12 M HCl. It was then pulled through a methanol-rinsed 50 mg Varian PPL (styrene divinyl benzene polymer) cartridge. The cartridge was rinsed with 2 ml 0.01 M HCl, and the metabolites were eluted with 1 ml methanol (adapted from [2]). It was dried down in a vacufuge and reconstituted to a total volume of 1 ml as the targeted intracellular samples were above.\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Rabinowitz JD, Kimball E.

Peak picking and alignment were carried out separately for the intracellular and extracellular samples. The files were converted from Thermo RAW files to mzML files using MSConvert [5]. In negative ion mode the peak threshold was set to an absolute intensity of 1000 in MSConvert before processing in XCMS. XCMS settings included: method = centWave, ppm = 2 (negative ion mode), 3 (positive ion mode), signal-to-noise = 10. The retention time correction setting and group.density were also used. Fragmentation mass spectra had a signal-to-noise threshold of 1. For the intracellular samples, pooled samples were used as an additional quality control. The average of each feature in the pooled samples or the experimental samples had to be greater than 1000. The coefficient of variance (100*standard deviation of feature/mean of feature) for each feature in the experimental samples and the pooled samples was calculated and only features that had a higher coefficient of variance in the experimental samples than in the pooled samples were retained for consideration [6].\n</p>\nThe list of features defined by a retention time and mass-to-charge ratio was further refined by removing any features found in the samples whose average was less than five times higher than the average of all the media blanks. In addition, features had to be present in both biological replicates at two different sampling points. This accounted for compounds that might be found in the seawater but were also being produced by the bacteria. To compare overall differences in metabolite composition in the samples, non-metric multidimensional scaling using Bray-Curtis distances was used.\n</p>\nThe targeted data was processed using Xcalibur (Thermo Scientific software). Standard curves were assessed individually and low quality peaks removed. The media controls were subtracted from the intracellular samples and used as a starting point reference for the extracellular samples.\n</p>\nRef: </br>\n[1] Smith CA, Want EJ, O'Maille G, Abagyan R, Siuzdak G.
