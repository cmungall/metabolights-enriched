                "description": "<p>Benthic organisms sustain coral reefs through their growth and metabolism, but less is known about how their released metabolites influence reef seawater microorganisms. To investigate metabolite composition of benthic exudates and their ecological significance for reef microbial communities, we harvested exudates from six species of Caribbean benthic organisms including stony corals, octocorals, and an invasive encrusting algae, and subjected these exudates to untargeted and targeted metabolomics approaches using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Incubations with reef seawater microorganisms were conducted to monitor changes in microbial community composition using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and abundance in relation to exudate source and three specific metabolites. Exudates tended to be enriched in amino acids, nucleosides, and vitamins, indicating that benthic organisms contribute labile organic matter to reefs. The phytohormone indole-3-acetic acid was detected in octocoral exudates, suggesting that this metabolite facilitates microbial interactions within and outside of benthic organisms. Exudate compositions were species-specific and significantly enriched in the indole class of metabolites. Microbial abundances and specific microbial taxa responded differently in relation to exudates from stony corals and octocorals, demonstrating the link between benthic organismal composition, metabolite exudates, and microbial growth. Conversely, microbial communities did not respond to additions of the individual metabolites, suggesting that reef microorganisms likely provide diverse metabolite pools that support microbial growth. This work identifies, quantifies, and compares metabolites released from common Caribbean benthic organisms and indicates that recent shifts in benthic composition from stony to octocorals alter exudate composition and likely impact microbial community composition and function on coral reefs.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>UPLC-MS Metabolite uptake incubation assay</strong> is reported in the current study <strong>MTBLS3286</strong></p><p><strong>UPLC-MS Metabolite collection incubation assays</strong> are reported in <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/editor/study/MTBLS2855' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS2855</strong></a></p>",

These experiments were designed to assess if reef seawater microbial communities assimilate specific exometabolites released by benthic organisms and if the microbial communities respond distinctly to different metabolites. Experiments were conducted with 3 metabolites in separate incubations occurring on different days: <strong>riboflavin</strong>, <strong>pantothenic acid</strong>, and <strong>caffeine</strong>. B vitamins, <strong>riboflavin</strong> and <strong>pantothenic acid</strong>, were chosen because they were released by at least 4 of 6 species within the organism incubation experiments. <strong>Caffeine</strong> was selected because it was released in high quantities by <em>Ramicrusta textilis</em>. Samples were collected at 3 time points: 0, 6, and 24 hr. Incubations were conducted in the dark and processed in low-light conditions to minimize photodegradation of the metabolites, especially <strong>riboflavin</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p>Purified metabolite standards were diluted with MQ water to 5 nM (<strong>riboflavin</strong>, <strong>D-pantothenic acid</strong>) and 10 nM (<strong>caffeine</strong>) 1 mth prior to the incubations, frozen, and shipped to the United States Virgin Islands (USVI). Metabolite dilutions were prepared in combusted amber vials and kept in the dark to minimize photochemical degradation.</p><p><br></p><p>To set up the incubations, 5.5 L of seawater was collected approximately 1 m above the reef at <strong>Tektite reef</strong> (9 m depth) using Niskin bottles deployed by divers. Half of the seawater was filtered using a 0.1 \u03bcm, 47 mm Omnipore filter to create <strong>filtered seawater (FSW)</strong>, while the rest of the seawater was filtered using a 1 \u03bcm, 47 mm Omnipore filter to remove larger phytoplankton and protistan grazers, but retain picoplankton. The filtrate treatments were poured into 36 acid-washed and autoclaved 125 ml polycarbonate bottles. Due to the small volumes and to minimize the chance of sample contamination, the incubations were designed so that bottles could be sampled by sacrifice at each time point (<strong>T0</strong>, <strong>T6</strong>, and <strong>T24</strong>). Each incubation had 4 different experimental conditions: 3 different controls and 1 experimental treatment. The 3 controls included only <strong>FSW (F)</strong>, <strong>FSW</strong> with the addition of a <strong>metabolite spike</strong> (<strong>F + Mtb</strong>), and 1 \u03bcm <strong>FSW</strong> containing <strong>microbes</strong> (<strong>M</strong>). The experimental condition was 1 \u03bcm <strong>FSW</strong> containing <strong>microbes (M)</strong> with the addition of the <strong>metabolite (M + Mtb)</strong>. <strong>Metabolite spikes</strong> (20 pM for <strong>riboflavin</strong> and <strong>pantothenic acid</strong> and 70 pM for <strong>caffeine</strong>) were added to the (<strong>F + Mtb</strong>) and (<strong>M + Mtb</strong>) treatments by removing 500 \u03bcl (<strong>riboflavin</strong> and <strong>pantothenic acid</strong> incubations) or 875 \u03bcl (<strong>caffeine</strong> incubation) of seawater from each incubation bottle, replacing the lost volume with the appropriate <strong>metabolite spike</strong>, and inverting the bottles to mix. After the <strong>metabolite spikes</strong> were added, 24 of 36 incubation bottles were placed in a flow-through seawater table covered with a tarp and equipped with a HOBO data logger to monitor relative light levels and water temperature, while the remaining 12 bottles, accounting for triplicate bottles of each of the 4 experimental conditions, were immediately processed for the initial time point (<strong>T0</strong>).</p>",

The column was eluted at 0.5 ml/min with a combination of solvents: A) 0.1% formic acid in water and B) 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile. The chromatographic gradient was as follows: 1% B (1 min), 15% B (1-3 min), 50% B (3-6 min), 95% B (6-9 min), 95% B (10 min). The column was washed and re-equilibrated with 1% B (2 min) between injections. Settings for source gases were 55 (sheath) and 20 (auxiliary) and these settings are presented in arbitrary units.
