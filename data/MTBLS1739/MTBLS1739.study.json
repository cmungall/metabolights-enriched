                "description": "<p>Aspergillus fumigatus is a notorious opportunistic pathogen that causes Invasive Aspergillosis (IA) infections with high mortality in immunosuppressed individuals. Long-term antifungal drug azole abuse in clinical treatment and agriculture renders it ineffectual or drug resistant. Drug resistance can relate to the cellular metabolites and corresponding gene transcription. In this study, through untargeted metabolomics and transcriptomics following itraconazole (ITC) treatment we identified two plasma membrane-localized polyamine transporters Aftpo3 and Afdur3, which were important for polyamine homeostasis and ITC susceptibility in A.&nbsp;fumigatus. In the absence of Aftpo3 or Afdur3, the levels of cytoplasm polyamines had a moderate increase, accompanied by resistance to ITC. In comparison, overexpression of Aftpo3 or Afdur3 induced drastic increase of polyamines, which were linked with the sensitivity to ITC. Accordingly, our study demonstrated that concentration-dependence of polyamines affected susceptibility of A. fumigatus to ITC, by scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) at a moderate concentration or generating ROS at a high concentration rather than drug transport.</p>",

Precusor tolerance was set 5 ppm, fragment tolerance was set 10 ppm, and retention time (RT) tolerance was set 0.02 min. Internal standard detection parameters were deselected for peak RT alignment, isotopic peaks were excluded for analysis, and noise elimination level was set at 10.00, minimum intensity was set to 15 % of base peak intensity. The Excel file was obtained with three dimension data sets including m/z, peak RT and peak intensities, and RT\u2013m/z pairs were used as the identifier for each ion. The resulting matrix was further reduced by removing any peaks with missing value (ion intensity = 0) in more than 60 % samples. The internal standard was used for data QC (reproducibility). The positive and negative data were combined to get a combine data which was imported into SIMCA software package (version 14.0, Umetrics, Ume\u00e5, Sweden). Principle component analysis (PCA) and (orthogonal) partial least-squares-discriminant analysis (O)PLS-DA were carried out to visualize the metabolic alterations among experimental groups, after mean centering (Ctr) and Pareto variance (Par) scaling, respectively. The Hotelling\u2019s T2 region, shown as an ellipse in score plots of the models, defines the 95% confidence interval of the modeled variation. Variable importance in the projection (VIP) ranks the overall contribution of each variable to the OPLS-DA model, and those variables with VIP &gt; 1 are considered relevant for group discrimination. In this study, the default 7-round cross-validation was applied with 1/seventh of the samples being excluded from the mathematical model in each round, in order to guard against overfitting.&nbsp;</p>",
