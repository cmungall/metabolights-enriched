                "description": "Liver steatosis can be induced by fasting or high-fat diet. We investigated by lipidomic analysis whether such metabolic states are reflected in the lipidome of hepatocyte lipid droplets (LDs) from mice fed normal chow diet (FED), fasted (FAS), or fed a high-fat diet (HFD). LC-MS/MS at levels of lipid species profiles and of lipid molecular species uncovered a FAS phenotype of LD enriched in triacylglycerol (TG) molecular species with very long-chain (VLC)-PUFA residues and an HFD phenotype with less unsaturated TG species in addition to characteristic lipid marker species. Nutritional stress did not result in dramatic structural alterations in diacylglycerol (DG) and phospholipid (PL) classes. Moreover, molecular species of bulk TG and of DG indicated concomitant de novo TG synthesis and lipase-catalyzed degradation to be active in LDs. DG species with VLC-PUFA residues would be preferred precursors for phosphatidylcholine (PC) species, the others for TG molecular species. In addition, molecular species of PL classes fitted the hepatocyte Kennedy and phosphatidylethanolamine methyltransferase pathways. We demonstrate that lipidomic analysis of LDs enables phenotyping of nutritional stress. TG species are best suited for such phenotyping, whereas structural analysis of TG, DG, and PL molecular species provides metabolic insights.",

                        "description": "Wild-type male C57BL/6 mice (Jackson Laboratory; Bar Harbor, ME) aged 12 weeks were used in this study. Mice were maintained on a regular light (14 h)/dark(10 h) cycle and fed a standard laboratory chow diet (FED group) or high-fat diet (HFD group) containing 4.5 or 34 wt% fat in the diet, respectively. The third group of mice was fed a chow diet, but were fasted 14 h prior to euthanasia (FAS group). Starting with 6-week-old animals, the intervention trial was carried out two times under identical conditions. In each of the three groups, three animals were kept for 6 weeks in one cage per group with ad libitum access to food and water. During the intervention period, mice weights were monitored regularly. At the end of the 6 weeks feeding period, animals were euthanized at 8 AM under anesthesia with Narkodorm (60 \u00b5l/100 g weight) and the abdomen was surgically opened. Primary hepatocytes from livers were isolated as described previouly [1] with modifications. Prior to liver perfusion, buffers and collagenase type II solution (20 mg collagenase type II in 100 ml Krebs-Henseleit buffer without SO4(2-) but containing 0.1 mM CaCl2, 2% BSA) were brought to 37 \u00b0C. Each liver was perfused via the hepatic portal vein with Krebs-Henseleit buffer without Ca2+ and SO4(2-) (115 mM NaCl, 25 mM NaHCO3, 5.9 mM KCl, 1.18 mM MgCl2, 1.23 mM NaH2PO4, 6 mM glucose) for 10 min, followed by perfusion with collagenase type II solution. Thereafter, liver was carefully removed and transferred into a Petri dish filled with 5 ml collagenase type II solution, cut into small pieces, and pressed through a household sieve that was finally flushed with ice-cold Krebs-Henseleit buffer containing 1.2 mM Na2SO4 and 1.25 mM CaCl2. The cell suspension obtained was filtrated through a cell strainer (70 \u00b5m nylon filter) into a 50 ml Greiner tube. Approximately 20 ml ice-cold DMEM was added to the filtrated cell suspension, which was subsequently centrifuged at 50 x g in a Beckman CS-6R rotor for 3 min at 4 \u00b0C. Supernatant containing nonparenchymal cells was aspirated, and the remaining hepatocyte pellet was washed by resuspension of the cell pellet in 20 ml ice-cold Krebs-Henseleit buffer containing 1.2 mM Na2SO4 and 1.25 mM CaCl2 and centrifuged again under the same conditions as were applied before. Hepatocytes obtained in this manner were stored at 80 \u00b0C until isolation of LDs.\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Riccalton-Banks L, Bhandari R, Fry J, Shakesheff KM.

The cells were lysed by nitrogen cavitation at 800 psi for 10 min using nitrogen bomb, and the resulting homogenate was transferred to a 50 ml Greiner tube and centrifuged at 1,000 x g (Beckman CS-6R rotor) for 5 min at 4 \u00b0C to remove cell debris. The supernatant obtained was transferred to a SW41 ultracentrifuge tube and overlaid with buffer containing 50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM PMSF. The centrifugation was carried out at 100,000 x g in a Beckman ultracentrifuge (SW41 rotor, Beckman Coulter; Brea, CA) for 1 h at 4 \u00b0C; LDs were floated in a white band at the top of the tube. Floating LDs were collected into another SW41 tube, overlaid with the same buffer, and centrifuged at the same speed in the Beckman ultracentrifuge (SW41 rotor) for 1 h at 4 \u00b0C to avoid cytosol contamination. Refloating LDs were collected and used in all further experiments. LDs isolated from hepatocytes were measured individually (6 each for FED, FAS, and HFD group) according to the hyphenated approach described previously [1]. In brief, samples were spiked with 40 nmol TG 17:0/17:0/17:0 and 400 pmol PC 12:0/12:0 as internal standards, and lipids were extracted with methyl tert-butyl ether as described previously [2]. Lipid extracts were resuspended in 200 \u00b5l CHCl3/MeOH 1:1, and a mix of 45 LIPID MAPS internal standards was added.\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Fauland A, K\u00f6feler H, Tr\u00f6tzm\u00fcller M, Knopf A, Hartler J, Eberl A, Chitraju C, Lankmayr E, Spener F.

FA composition of lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs) and sphingomyelins (SMs) was obvious by elemental composition derived from high-resolution MS data and by lipid class-specific fragments (m/z 184). FA composition for phosphatidylinositol (PI) molecular species was elucidated by their carboxylate anions in negative MS/MS spectra. The most abundant FA fragment or neutral loss in an MS/MS spectrum was normalized to 100% (base peak). Fragments indicative for FA with less than 25% intensity of the base peak were termed minor FA fragments and all others were termed major FA fragments. For better manageability, particularly of isobaric species, possible combinations predominantly composed of major fragments were considered major molecular species, and possible combinations predominantly composed of minor fragments were considered minor molecular species. On the one hand quantitative mass spectrometric data for each lipid species are given in \u2030 (or %) relative to total amount of a lipid class and pertain to 1st and 2nd intervention trials, consequently they are means \u00b1 SD of 6 animals. Total lipid class amounts were calculated as sum from individual lipid species; the standard deviation of the lipid class is a result of the individual standard deviations of each species determined by the law of error propagation.",

This type of calculation was chosen, because it illustrates relative changes in the lipid profile between different statistical groups very well. On the other hand mass spectrometric data for each lipid species in nmol (or \u00b5mol) per LD sample are presented as means \u00b1 SD (n = 3). These additional values pertain to the second intervention trial and were calculated by LDA based on sets of internal standards for each lipid class as described previously [1][2]. For better comparability, data were normalized to the amount of acylglycerols measured by the TG Kit referred to previously in this section. Principal component analysis (PCA) based on \u2030 data (n = 6) was performed in R using the function prcomp with default parameters.\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Fauland A, K\u00f6feler H, Tr\u00f6tzm\u00fcller M, Knopf A, Hartler J, Eberl A, Chitraju C, Lankmayr E, Spener F.
