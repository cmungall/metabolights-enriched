                "description": "Small molecules not only represent cellular building blocks and metabolic intermediates, but also regulatory ligands and signaling molecules that interact with proteins. Although these interactions affect cellular metabolism, growth, and development, they have been largely understudied. Herein, we describe a method, dubbed PROtein-Metabolite Interactions using Size separation (PROMIS) that allows simultaneous, global analysis of endogenous protein-small molecule and of protein\u2012protein complexes. To this end, a cell-free native lysate from Arabidopsis thaliana cell cultures was fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography, followed by quantitative metabolomic and proteomic analyses. Proteins and small molecules showing similar elution behavior, across protein containing fractions, constituted putative interactors. Applying PROMIS to an A. thaliana extract, we ascertained known protein\u2012protein (PPIs) and protein-metabolite (PMIs) interactions and reproduced binding between small-molecule protease inhibitors and their respective proteases. More importantly, we present examples of two experimental strategies that exploit the PROMIS dataset to identify novel PMIs. By looking for similar elution behavior of metabolites and enzymes belonging to the same biochemical pathways, we identified putative feedback and feed-forward regulations in pantothenate biosynthesis and the methionine salvage cycle, respectively. By combining PROMIS with an orthogonal affinity purification approach, we identified an interaction between the dipeptide Tyr-Asp and the glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. In summary, we present proof of concept for a powerful experimental tool that enables system-wide analysis of PMIs and PPIs across all biological systems. The dataset obtained here comprises nearly 140 metabolites and 5000 proteins, which can be mined for putative interactors.",

SEC was performed with a HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 200 prep grade column (GE Healthcare Life Science, Little Chalfont, UK) connected to an \u00c4KTA explorer 10 (GE Healthcare Life Science, Little Chalfont, UK) operating at 4 \u00b0C. The flow rate was set to 0.8 ml/min. 57 fractions of 1.5 ml were collected from 40 to 125.5 ml elution volume of which 1 ml was dried in a speed-vac overnight and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C for metabolomic analysis. For the protein free control experiment, 50 mg of protein of the soluble fraction was precipitated with 80% acetone at \u221220\u2009\u00b0C for 5\u2009h. After pelleting denatured proteins by centrifugation at 3452 x g for 20 min at 4 \u00b0C, the supernatant was dried overnight in a speed-vac. Small molecules were resuspended the next day in the original volume of lysis buffer and used for SEC.\n</p>\nMetabolites were extracted from SEC fractions as previously described[1]. Briefly, collected fractions were extracted using Methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE)/Methanol/Water solvent system to separate proteins, lipids, and polar compounds into pellet, organic, and aqueous phase, respectively[2]. After extraction, the aqueous phase was dried in a speed-vac and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until LC/MS analysis.\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Veyel D, Kierszniowska S, Kosmacz M, Sokolowska EM, Michaelis A, Luzarowski M, Szlachetko J, Willmitzer L, Skirycz A.

For metabolites that showed a higher ppm error in standard compound measurements we allowed a corresponding deviation of up to 10 ppm.",

In addition a replicate extract of one experiment was analyzed by MetaSysX GmbH (MetaSysX GmbH, Potsdam, Germany) using identical chromatographic settings and annotations were transferred to in-house measured data by estimating the RT shifts over the chromatogram following the most abundant feature in every 0.05 min window. The higher number of annotations reported here in comparison to those previously described[1] results from the growth of our standard library e.g. as a result of incorporation of 400 dipeptide standards.  Granting the request of MetaSysX, RT information was removed from the Supplement but will be shared upon inquiry.\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Veyel D, Kierszniowska S, Kosmacz M, Sokolowska EM, Michaelis A, Luzarowski M, Szlachetko J, Willmitzer L, Skirycz A.
