                "description": "<p>Aspartate is crucial for nucleotide synthesis, ammonia detoxification and maintaining redox balance via the malate-aspartate-shuttle (MAS). To disentangle these multiple roles of aspartate metabolism, tools are required that measure aspartate concentrations in real time and in live cells. We introduce AspSnFR, a genetically encoded green fluorescent biosensor for intracellular aspartate, engineered through displaying and screening biosensor libraries on mammalian cells. In live cells, AspSnFR is able to precisely and quantitatively measure cytosolic aspartate concentrations and dissect its production from glutamine. Combining high-content imaging of AspSnFR with pharmacological perturbations exposes differences in metabolic vulnerabilities of aspartate levels based on nutrient availability. Further, AspSnFR facilitates tracking of aspartate export from mitochondria through SLC25A12, the MAS\u2019 key transporter. We show that SLC25A12 is a rapidly responding and direct route to couple Ca2+ signaling with mitochondrial aspartate export. This establishes SLC25A12 as a crucial link between cellular signaling, mitochondrial respiration and metabolism.</p>",

These were were generated according to open-access RESOLUTE protocols, accessible at www.zenodo.org under accession codes 7457297 (KO) and 7457295 (KO-OE).</p><p><br></p><p>HCT116-SCL25A12-KOOE-c8p1 cells were subjected to limiting dilution cloning in 384-well cell culture plates. From this process, 45 clones were isolated and expanded. To verify correct mitochondrial localization, each clone was stained for SLC25A12-HA with an anti-HA antibody and assessed for colocalization with Mitotracker Orange. Based on these images, clone L8 of HCT116 SLC25A12 was selected for transfection with cyto-AspSnFR encoded in a pcDNA3.1/Neo vector. In adherence to the manufacturer\u2019s guidelines, cells were seeded to achieve a 60% confluency on the day of transfection. The transfection mixture was prepared by combining 97 \u03bcL of OptiMem, 2.7 \u03bcL of X-tremeGENE9 transfection reagent, and 1 \u03bcg of plasmid DNA. The following day, cells were harvested and relocated to T75 cell culture flasks. Subsequently, either 0.4 or 0.8 mg/mL Geneticin was added to the SLC25A12 KOOE-L8 cells. The antibiotic selection was sustained for 3 weeks. Cells were sorted twice via FACS, with a 2-week interval, to isolate those expressing high levels of cyto-AspSnFR. The resulting cell line was named HCT116-SLC25A12-KO-OE-AspSnFR, characterized by its stable high expression of cyto-AspSnFR together with a doxycycline-inducible expression of SLC25A12-HA. This cell line was further expanded for detailed characterization and subsequent experimental use.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Treatment and metabolite extraction</strong></p><p>Cells were seeded in 24-well plates at 75,000 cells/well (HCT116-SLC25A12-KOOE-AspSnFR) in medium -/+ 1 mg/mL doxycycline. The following day, medium was renewed for doxycycline washout. After another day, treatments were performed for 3 h (-/+ 1 mM pyruvate, -/+ 4.5 g/L glucose, -/+ 2 mM GlutaMax or glutamine in 10% dialyzed FCS/DMEM). Then empty medium or medium containing Thapsigargin was added (to a final concentration of 100 nM). Cells were then washed with room-temperature 75 mM ammonium carbonate buffer adjusted to pH 7.4 and immediately quenched by addition of 250 \u00b5L/well HPLC-grade methanol (chilled to -20 \u00b0C), followed by of 60 \u00b5L/well ice-cold HPLC-grade water containing 2.5 \u00b5M internal standards (13C415N-aspartic acid and 13C515N-glutamic acid) for a final MeOH concentration of 80%.</p>",

Concentrations were calculated from peak area ratios of analytes and corresponding internal standards (13C15N-aspartic acid for aspartate acid and asparagine, 13C15N-glutamic acid for glutamic acid and glutamine) matched against regression curves obtained for each analyte from a standards dilution series spanning the concentration range from 1 to 1000 \u03bcM. Calculated concentration values from both analytical replicates were averaged. The BCA protein quantification value was used together with a biochemical measure of protein content to cell volume<strong> </strong>of 6.5 \u03bcL/mg to calculate the total cell volume in the sample. By dividing the relative concentration by the total cell volume, absolute whole-cell concentrations were obtained.</p>",
