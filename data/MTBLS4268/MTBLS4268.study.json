                "description": "<p>Solute carrier (SLC) transporters control fluxes of nutrients and metabolites across membranes and thereby represent a critical interface between the microenvironment and cellular and subcellular metabolism. Because of substantial functional overlap, the interplay and relative contributions of SLCs in response to environmental stresses remain poorly elucidated. To infer functional relationships between SLCs and metabolites, we developed a strategy to identify SLCs able to sustain cell viability and proliferation under growth-limiting concentrations of essential nutrients. One-by-one depletion of 13 amino acids required for cell proliferation enabled gain-of-function genetic screens using a SLC-focused CRISPR/Cas9\u2013based transcriptional activation approach to uncover transporters relieving cells from growth-limiting metabolic bottlenecks. Among the transporters identified, we characterized the cationic amino acid transporter SLC7A3 as a gene that, when up-regulated, overcame low availability of arginine and lysine by increasing their uptake, whereas SLC7A5 was able to sustain cellular fitness upon deprivation of several neutral amino acids. Moreover, we identified metabolic compensation mediated by the glutamate/aspartate transporters SLC1A2 and SLC1A3 under glutamine-limiting conditions. Overall, this gain-of-function approach using human cells uncovered functional transporter-nutrient relationships and revealed that transport activity up-regulation may be sufficient to overcome environmental metabolic restrictions.</p>",

The plate was transferred to ice and 1500 \u00b5L/well of 80:20 ice-cold MeOH:H2O solution was added, cells were scraped and transferred to pre-cooled Eppendorf tubes. Samples were shortly vortexed, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, thawed on ice and centrifuged at 20,800 x g at 4 \u00b0C for 10 min. Supernatant was transferred into a HPLC vial and evaporated using a nitrogen evaporator. Evaporated samples were reconstituted in 50 \u00b5L of 80:20 MeOH:H2O and stored at -80 \u00b0C till analysis. The targeted metabolomics was performed using the Biocrates Absolute IDQ p180 kit. The kit provides (semi)-quantitative analysis of 184 metabolites. Sample preparation was performed according to the User Manual provided by the manufacturer. Briefly, 10 \u00b5L of internal standard was loaded onto the 96-well kit plate, dried under nitrogen and followed by loading 10 \u00b5L of samples, blanks, calibration standards and quality control samples. After an additional drying step, derivatization reagent was added, and samples were incubated for 20 min at room temperature. The 96-well plate was dried and the extraction solvent was added.</p>",
