                "description": "Early diagnosis of acute community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is important in patient triage and treatment decisions. To identify biomarkers that distinguish patients with CAP from non-CAP controls, we conducted an untargeted global metabolome analysis for plasma samples from142 patients with CAP (CAP cases) and 97 without CAP (non-CAP controls). Thirteen lipid metabolites could discriminate between CAP cases and non-CAP controls with area-under-the-receiver-operating-characteristic curve of > 8 (P \u2264 10-9). The levels of glycosphingolipids, sphingomyelins, lysophosphatidylcholines and L-palmitoylcarnitine were higher, while the levels of lysophosphatidylethanolamines were lower in the CAP cases than those in non-CAP controls. All 13 metabolites could distinguish CAP cases from the non-infection, extrapulmonary infection and non-CAP respiratory tract infection subgroups. The levels of trihexosylceramide (d18:1/16:0) were higher, while the levels of lysophosphatidylethanolamines were lower, in the fatal than those of non-fatal CAP cases. Our \ufb01ndings suggest that lipid metabolites are potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for CAP.",

Waters Acquity UPLC BEH C18 column (2.1 x 100 mm, 1.7 \u03bcm, Milford Massachusetts, USA) was used for the chromatographic separation of plasma supernatant with injection volume of 5 \u03bcl. Temperatures of the column and autosampler were maintained at 45 \u00b0C and 10 \u00b0C, respectively. The separation was performed at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min under a gradient program in which mobile phase A was composed of 0.1% formic acid (v/v) in water and mobile phase B was composed of acetonitrile. The gradient program was applied as follows: time (t) = 0 min, 5% B; t = 0.5 min, 5% B; t = 5.5 min, 48% B; t = 16 min, 78% B; t = 31min, 80% B; t = 33min, 99.5% B; t = 37min, 99.5% B; t = 37.1 min, 5% B.

The sheath gas was kept at a flow rate of 10 l/min at a temperature of 380 \u00b0C. The voltages of the fragmentor, skimmer 1, and octopoleRFPeak were 135V, 50V and 500V, respectively. The mass data was collected between m/z 80 and 1,700 at the acquisition rate of 2 scans per second. Two reference masses at m/z 121.0509 (protonated molecular ion of C5H4N4) and m/z 922.0098 (protonated molecular ion of C18H18O6N3P3F24) for positive mode as well as m/z 119.0363 (deprotonated molecular ion of C5H4N4) and m/z 966.0007 (formate adduct of C18H18O6N3P3F24) for negative mode were used as constant mass correction during liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) run. Product ion scanning experiments were conducted using ultra-high purity nitrogen as collision gas with same parameters set in MS acquisition, the collision energy (CE) was set at 10, 20 or 40eV to generate the best quality of MS/MS spectra for the putative identification and structural elucidation of the significant metabolites.",

The LC-MS data was processed using XCMS package (http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/2.8/bioc/html/xcms.html) operating in R script (http://www.r-project.org/). Data was further processed with normalization, scaling, filtering and statistical analysis using MetaboAnalyst 3.0 (www.metaboanalyst.ca). </p>\nThe MS data was log2-transformed, mean-centered, and divided by the standard deviation of each variable scaling for statistical analysis. To identify molecular features (MFs) that can distinguish CAP cases with non-CAP controls, both multivariate and univariate analyses were performed. For multivariate analyses, principal component analysis (PCA) and partial-least squares discrimination analysis (PLS-DA) were performed for unsupervised and supervised analyses, respectively. PLS-DA models were validated based on accuracy, multiple correlation coefficient (R2) and cross-validated R2 (Q2) in cross-validation and permutation test by applying 2,000 iterations, and the significance of the variables was ranked using the variable importance in projection (VIP) score. For univariate analysis, volcano plots were constructed and analyzed using Student\u2019s t-test. Significant MFs with VIP score of >1 in PLSDA and volcano plot analysis of fold-change >1.5 and P values <0.05 were included for univariate receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis using ROCEET (http://www.roccet.ca). The classical ROC curve analysis was performed. Area-under-receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was calculated by Monte Carlo Cross Validation using sub-sampling. Significant MFs with AUC \u22650.8 were identified and box-whisker plots were generated using Analyse-it software (Analyse-it, UK). The data was subsequently processed with hierarchical clustering analysis employing Eluclidean distance measure with average clustering algorithm using MetaboAnalyst 3.0. ",
