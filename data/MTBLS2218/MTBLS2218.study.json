                "description": "Synthetic cathinones belong to the most often seized new psychoactive substances on an international level. This study investigated the toxicometabolomics, particularly the in vitro metabolism of 2-(methylamino)-1-(4-methylphenyl)-1-pentanone (4-MPD) and 2-(ethylamino)-1-(4-methylphenyl)-1-pentanone (4-MEAP) in pooled human liver microsomes (pHLM) using untargeted metabolomics techniques. Incubations were performed with the substrates in concentrations ranging from 0, 12.5, and 25 \u00b5M. Analysis was done by means of high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (HPLC-HRMS/MS) in full scan only and the obtained data was evaluated using XCMS Online and MetaboAnalyst. Significant features were putatively identified using a separate parallel reaction monitoring method. Statistical analysis was performed using Kruskal-Wallis test for prefiltering significant features and subsequent hierarchical clustering, as well as principal component analysis (PCA). Hierarchical clustering or PCA showed a distinct clustering of all concentrations with most of the features z-scores rising with the concentration of the investigated substances. Identification of significant features left many of them unidentified but revealed metabolites of both 4-MPD and 4-MEAP. Both substances formed carboxylic acids, were hydroxylated at the alkyl chain, and formed metabolites after combined hydroxylation and reduction of the cathinone oxo group. 4-MPD additionally formed a dihydroxy metabolite and a hydroxylamine. 4-MEAP was additionally found reduced at the cathinone oxo group, N-dealkylated, and formed an oxo metabolite. These findings are the first to describe the metabolic pathways of 4-MPD and to extend our knowledge about the metabolism of 4-MEAP. Findings, particularly the MS data of the metabolites, are essential for setting up metabolite-based toxicological (urine) screening procedures.",

The UltiMate 3000 RS system consisted of a degasser, a quaternary pump, an autosampler, and an analytical column heater (column temperature 40 \u00b0C). Mass calibration was done prior to analysis according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations using external mass calibration. Additionally, before each experiment, the spray shield and capillary were cleaned. The performance of the column and the mass spectrometer was tested using a mixture previously described<strong>[2]</strong> prior to every experiment. Gradient reversed phase elution was performed on a TF Accucore Phenyl-Hexyl column (100 x 2.1 mm, 2.6 \u00b5m). The mobile phases consisted of 2 mM aqueous ammonium formate containing formic acid (0.1%, v/v) and acetonitrile (1%, v/v, pH 3, eluent A), as well as 2 mM ammonium formate in acetonitrile/methanol (1:1, v/v) containing formic acid (0.1%, v/v) and water (1%, v/v, eluent B). The flow rate was set from 1\u201310 min to 500 \u00b5l/min and from 10\u201313.5 min to 800 \u00b5l/min using the following gradient: 0\u20131.0 min 99% A, 1\u201310 min to 1% A, 10\u201311.5 min hold 1% A, 11.5\u201313.5 min hold 99% A. For normal phase elution, a Macherey-Nagel (D\u00fcren, Germany) HILIC Nucleodur column (125 x 3 mm, 3 \u00b5m) was used. The mobile phases consisted of 200 mM aqueous ammonium acetate (eluent C) and acetonitrile containing formic acid (0.1%, v/v, eluent D). The flow rate was set to 500 \u00b5l/min using the following gradient: 0\u20131 min 2% C, 1\u20135 min 20% C, 5\u20138.5 min 60% C, 8.5\u201310 min hold 60% C, 10\u201312 min hold 2% C.

Subsequently, QC files were used for peak detection parameter optimization as previously described<strong>[2]</strong>. Peak picking parameters that were used in this study are summarized in <strong>Table S1</strong> of the paper associated with this study. Preprocessing and statistical evaluation was conducted using <strong>XCMS Online (version 3.7.1)</strong> and <strong>MetaboAnalyst</strong> (via <a href='https://www.metaboanalyst.ca/' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'>https://www.metaboanalyst.ca/</a>) <strong>(version 4.0)</strong>. The converted MS data sets of Blank, Low, High, and QC were uploaded, and the parameters were adjusted according to the optimized values generated through the algorithm. Afterwards, features with valid extracted ion chromatograms and <strong>p-values lower than or equal to 0.01</strong> after <strong>Kruskal-Wallis</strong> analysis were kept. Chromatograms were assumed valid when the peak detection integrated gaussian-like chromatographic peaks rather than arbitrary baseline fluctuation. Samples were also checked for within group outliers and removed from the study in case of high deviation. The obtained feature table was subsequently uploaded to <strong>MetaboAnalyst</strong> for further statistical evaluation. In <strong>MetaboAnalyst</strong>, missing value estimation was skipped because in no case missing values were present. Data filtering was skipped as well because in every case, less than 5000 features were submitted and therefore a need to compress the data was not given. After log transformation, the data set was submitted to multivariate statistical analysis. Hierarchical clustering was performed using Euclidian distances and complete clustering. Color contrast in the corresponding heatmap was set to <strong>'Heat Color'</strong>, samples were not reorganized, and normalized data was selected to be displayed. Additionally, features were autoscaled for this analysis. Finally, a principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to inspect the samples clustering in the corresponding score plots and the features\u2019 influence on the clustering in the corresponding loading plots. The data set was not scaled prior to PCA. Names of the features were adopted from <strong>XCMS Online</strong> using <strong>'M'</strong> followed by the rounded mass and <strong>\u201cT\u201d</strong> followed by the retention time in seconds (e.g., '<strong>M206T264'</strong> as given in <strong>Table S2</strong> of the paper associated with this study for protonated 4-MPD at m/z 206.1543 and a retention time of 264 s using reversed phase chromatography).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Chambers MC, Maclean B, Burke R, Amodei D, Ruderman DL, Neumann S, Gatto L et al.

Individual spectra were exported after subtracting the baseline left and right of the peak. After conversion to <strong>mzXML</strong> format using <strong>Proteo Wizard</strong>, spectra were imported to <strong>NIST MSSEARCH version 2.3</strong>. A library search for identification was conducted using the following settings: spectrum search type, identity (<strong>MS/MS</strong>); precursor ion m/z, in spectrum; spectrum search options, none; presearch, off; other options, none. <strong>MS/MS</strong> search was conducted using the following settings: precursor tolerance, \u00b1 5 ppm; product ion tolerance, \u00b1 10 ppm; ignoring peaks around precursor, \u00b1 m/z 1. The search was conducted by using the following libraries: <strong>NIST 14 (nist_msms and nist_msms2 sublibraries)</strong> and <strong>Wiley METLIN Mass Spectral Database</strong>. Metabolites of the investigated <strong>NPS</strong> were identified by interpreting their spectra in comparison to those of the parent compounds.</p>",
