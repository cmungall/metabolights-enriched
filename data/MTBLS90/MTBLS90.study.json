The 1,016 participants (50% women) have been extensively phenotyped. In March 2006 a reinvesigation of the cohort at the age of 75 was started. The major measurements performed at age 70 were also repeated at age 75. Here we make publically available all the metabolomics analysis on serum samples from the investigation at age 70. In the final analysis we included samples from 968 individuals.",

Blood samples were drawn between 8 and 10 am after an overnight fast. Plasma taken in EDTA-tubes was centrifuged, aliquoted and frozen within 1 hr. Serum was aliquoted and frozen within 2 hr. These samples were stored at -70 \u00baC in liquid nitrogen.

Data was collected in positive ion mode, scanning from 50-1200 at a rate of 5 scans/s. Scans were collected alternatively in MS mode at collision energy of 6 V and in idMS/MS mode using higher collision energy (15-30 V). IdMS/MS (also called MSE or MSn) allows for unbiased view of MS/MS fragmentation without additional experiments5.\n</p>\nCalibration was performed prior to sample analysis via infusion of sodium formate solution, with mass accuracy within 1 ppm. The capillary voltage was held at 2200 V, the source temp at 150 \u00baC, and the desolvation temperature at 350 \u00baC at a nitrogen desolvation gas flow rate of 800 l/hr. The quadrupole was held at collision energy of 6 V.",

                        "description": "Raw data were processed using XCMS software. Procedures to perform non-targeted metabolomics in large-population studies have been previously described by our group; the code has been made publically available at https://github.com/andgan/metabolomics_pipeline. Metabolic feature detection, alignment, grouping, imputation and normalization were performed separately for each study. Each feature is characterized by a specific mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) and retention time. A single metabolite is normally represented by more than one feature. Indiscriminant (id) MS and idMS/MS spectra were generated for all the significant features. Those with highly similar spectra, strong correlation and similar retention time were deemed to be from the same metabolite. We used the spectra to identify the corresponding metabolite [1].\n</p>\nFour approaches were considered, in agreement with what has been suggested by the Metabolomics Standard Initiative. First, feature intensities were transformed to the log2 base scale to approximate normal distribution. Second, potential sample outliers were identified by plotting the total intensity for each sample. Samples with extremes total intensities might indicate sample degradation or technical errors and these samples were excluded.  Third, an ANOVA-type normalization was used to take into account factors of unwanted variation. Specifically, we fitted a linear regression for association between each feature intensity and several factors of unwanted variability. We then used the residuals from the regression as new feature intensities. The factors of unwanted variability can be identified by studying the association between several technical variables and the first principal components. In TwinGene we adjusted for the square root of the sum of the squared differences between original retention time and corrected retention time, analysis date, storage time and unknown cluster effect. Finally, feature intensities were averaged between technical duplicates to reduce the inherent instrumental variability. Features with poor correlation between duplicates were excluded [2][3].\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Ganna A et.al.
