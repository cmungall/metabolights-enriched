                "description": "<h4>Background: </h4> The study of fat deposition in yaks of different gender plays a positive role in improving the meat quality and breeding of yaks. In this work, the characteristic of fat deposition in male and female yaks, and the regulations of gender difference to fat deposition in yaks were explored. <h4>Result: </h4> Compared with male yaks, the female yaks possessed higher or more body fat rate (BFR) of visceral except liver, fat content in muscle and liver and subcutaneous fat ( p < 0.05); the cholesterol (CH), triglyceride (TG), very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), leptin (LEP) and cortisol (COR) in serum of female yaks were higher ( p < 0.05 ); meanwhile, the fatty acid synthase (FAS), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) and diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (DGAT-1) in livers of female yaks were higher ( p < 0.05). The metabonomics analysis showed 13(S)-HODE, linoleic acid and linolenic acid and myo-inositol in subcutaneous fat of female yaks increased ( p < 0.05 ); meanwhile, the transcriptomic analysis the gene expressions of prenylcysteine oxidase 1 (PCYOX1), acyl-coenzyme a-cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT), protein farnesyltransferase subunit beta (FNTB), apolipoprotein E (ApoE), DGAT2, very long chain fatty acids protein 6 (ELOVL6), NADP-dependent malic enzyme (ME1), SCD, acyl-CoA-binding protein (ACBP) and perilipin-5 (PLIN5), LEP, sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBF1) upregulated in subcutaneous fat of female yaks ( p FDR < 0.05), whereas the gene expressions of CPT1, acetyl-CoA acyltransferase 1(ACAA1) and adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) downregulated ( p FD R < 0.01). <h4>Conclusion: </h4> The fat and cholesterol synthesis increased in liver of female yaks, and the fat transport in blood of female yaks increased too. In subcutaneous fat of female yaks, the high levels of myo-inositol activated the calcium signaling, following the increase of secretion in fat cell. Then, the high levels of LEP and 13(S)-HODE strengthened PPAR signal, and the fat synthesis, cholesterol synthesis, fatty acid biosynthesis of the linoleic and linolenic acid being the precursor increased, whereas lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation decreased by the regulation of downstream genes in PPAR signal. Meanwhile, SREBF1 also played an important part in the regulation of fat metabolism in yaks of different gender.",

In late September, the day before the yaks were sacrificed, all yaks were deprived of feed overnight and they were sacrificed the following morning through electrical stunning. Before being sacrificed, yaks were weighed, and 20 mL blood were collected from the jugular vein of each yak under limosis.

The Hotelling\u2019s T2 region, shown as an ellipse in score plots of the models, defines the 95% confidence interval of the modeled variation. Variable importance in the projection (VIP) ranks the overall contribution of each variable to the OPLS-DA model, and those variables with VIP &gt; 1 are considered relevant for group discrimination. In this study, the default 7-round cross-validation was applied with 1/7th of the samples being excluded from the mathematical model in each round, in order to guard against overfitting. The differential metabolites were selected on the basis of the combination of a statistically significant threshold of variable influence on projection (VIP) values obtained from the OPLS- DA model and p values from a 2-tailed Student\u2019s t test on the normalized peak areas, where metabolites with VIP values larger than 1.0 and p values less than 0.05 were considered as differential metabolites.</p>",
