Following autoclave sterilization, pH was adjusted to 7.7 using sodium hydroxide. 1 ml of the following supplements and solutions were added: 150 mM monopotassium phosphate, 500 mM ammonium chloride pH 7.5, trace element solution, selenite-tungstate solution, vitamin solution, thiamine solution, B12 solution and 0.21 g sodium bicarbonate[1]. Ultra-pure water (MQ) was prepared by purifying deionized water with an Astacus membraPure system (Astacus membraPure, 18.3 m\ud835\udefa x cm 25 \u00b0C).\n</p>\nMetabolite standards were obtained from commercial sources (see Table S4 in the paper associated with this study) and combined into mixtures where each compound had a final concentration of 0.4 mM. Sample aliquots were prepared by drying down 200 \u03bcl of the mixture in a speed-vacuum concentrator (Eppendorf Concentrator Plus(R), 2.5 h, 45 \u00b0C, V-AQ).

Mixture aliquots (n = 5) were also re-suspended in MQ as a no-salt control to highlight the effects of saltwater on metabolite\nderivatization. 40 \u03bcl ribitol (0.2 mM) and 100 \u03bcl cholestane (1 mM) were added to each aliquot as internal standards. MQ and ASW samples were first derivatized following the (i) two-step Methoxamine-trimethylsilylation (TMS) previously described. Successive steps in the proposed protocol were then applied to ASW samples to demonstrate the combined effects on metabolite detection: (ii) exchange of trimethylsilyl-N-methyl trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA) for N,O-Bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA), (iii) removal of residual water from the salt pellet by increasing the speed vacuum drying time and by introducing a toluene drying step to help extract water from the salt pellet, (iv) ultrasonication of the samples after the steps involving addition of toluene, MeOX, BSTFA and following the last derivatization step, and (v) drying the MeOX in pyridine reagent between derivatization reactions representing the full SeaMet workflow.\n</p>\nTo prepare marine samples for GC-MS analysis, 0.5 to 1 ml of a salt-water sample or experimental mixture dissolved in ASW was dried in a speed vacuum concentrator for 8 h (Eppendorf Concentrator Plus(R), 45 \u00b0C, V-AQ). To further remove residual water locked within the salt pellet, 250 \u03bcl of toluene (99.8%, < 0.2% water) was added to each sample and the mixture was ultrasonicated for 10 min at maximum intensity. The toluene was subsequently removed under a gentle flow of N2 gas. Metabolite derivatization was performed by adding 80 \u03bcl of MeOX dissolved in pyridine (20 mg/ml) to the dried pellet. The mixture was ultrasonicated for 10 min at maximum intensity, briefly vortexed to dissolve the pellet into solution, and subsequently incubated for 90 min at 37 \u00b0C using a thermal rotating incubator under constant rotation at 1350 rpm. The pyridine was removed from the sample at room temperature under a gentle flow of N2 gas (approx. 1 h). Following the addition of 100 \u03bcl of N,O-Bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA), the mixture was ultrasonicated for 10 min at maximum intensity, vortexed, and incubated for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C using a thermal rotating incubator under constant rotation at 1350 rpm. The derivatized mixture was ultrasonicated (EMag Emmi-12HC) for 10 min at maximum intensity. Remaining salt in each sample was pelleted through centrifugation at 21.1 x g for 2 min at 4 \u00b0C. 100 \u03bcl was transferred to a GC-MS vial for analysis. The full proposed method has been published previously[1].\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Sogin1 E, Pukus1 E, Dubilier1 N, and Liebeke M.

Using an Agilent 7693 autosampler, 1 \u03bcl was injected in splitless mode through a GC inlet liner (ultra inert, splitless, single taper, glass wool, Agilent) onto a DB-5MS column (30 m x 0.25 mm, film thickness 0.25 \u03bcm; including 10 m DuraGuard column, Agilent). The inlet liner was changed every 50 samples to avoid damage to the GC column and associated shifts in retention times. The injector temperature was set at 290 \u00b0C. Chromatography was achieved with an initial column oven temperature set at 60 \u00b0C followed by a ramp of 20 \u00b0C/min until 325 \u00b0C, then held for 2 mins. Helium carrier gas was used at a constant flow rate of 1 ml/min.",
