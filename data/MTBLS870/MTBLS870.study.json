                "description": "<p>Dietary glycerol supplementation in aquaculture feed is seen as an alternative and inexpensive way to &nbsp;fuel fish metabolism, attenuate metabolic utilization of dietary proteins and, subsequently reduce nitrogen &nbsp;excretion. In this study, we evaluated the impact of dietary glycerol supplementation has on nitrogen excretion of European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax) and its effects on metabolite profile and bacterial community composition of gut digesta. These effects were evaluated in a 60-day trial with fish fed diets supplemented with 0, 2.5 or 5% (w/w) refined glycerol. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and high-throughput 16S rRNA sequencing characterized the effects of glycerol supplementation of digesta metabolite and bacterial community composition of 6h postprandial fish. Our results showed ammonia excretion was not altered by dietary glycerol supplementation and the highest glycerol dosage was associated with significant increases in amino acids and a significant decrease of ergogenic creatine in digesta metabolome. Concomitantly, significant decreases in putative amino acid degradation pathways were detected in the predicted metagenome analysis, suggesting a metabolic shift. Taxon-specific analysis &nbsp;revealed significant increases in abundance of some specific genera (e.g. Burkholderia and Vibrio) and bacterial diversity. Overall, our results indicate glycerol supplementation may decrease amino acid catabolism without adversely affecting fish gut bacterial communities.</p>",

                        "description": "<p>The aquaculture experiment was conducted at BOGA facility in CIIMAR (Matosinhos, Portugal). European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax) were obtained from a commercial fish farm (MARESA, Spain) and transported to CIIMAR (Matosinhos, Portugal). Upon arrival, fish were acclimated in a holding tank for 12 wk. Fish were distributed into 3 tanks of 350 l capacity with a stock density of 8.32 g/l. The tanks were connected to a closed recirculating system, water flow rate per tank was set at 500 l/h. Temperature (22.0 \u00b1 1.0 \u00b0C), salinity (30.0 \u00b1 1.0%), pH (8.2 \u00b1 0.1), oxygen content (\u226595% air saturation), ammonia (\u22640.8 mg/l) and nitrites (\u22640.5 mg/l) were monitored daily, ensuring constant and suitable conditions. The photoperiod was set for 12 h light:12 h dark. Each tank containing 13 fish (initial BW 222.2 \u00b1 5.5 g) was assigned to the following dietary treatments: 1 group was fed the basal diet (Control), another 2 groups were fed the basal diet supplemented with glycerol at 2.5% or at 5%. The feeding trial lasted 60 days, and during that time fish were hand-fed twice daily (09.00 and 16.00 h) 6 times/wk to apparent satiation. No mortalities were detected during the trial. At the end of the trial all fish were sampled.</p><p><br></p><p>3 experimental diets were formulated and produced by Sparos (Olh\u00e3o, Portugal). The diet was formulated to give a contrast in the glycerol content by supplementing a basal diet (Control \u2013 CNTRL) with this compound at 2.5% (GLY 2.5) or at 5% (GLY 5). All the experimental diets were isoproteic (48.5%) and isoenergetic (21 kJ/kg). At the end of the trial, 7 fish per tank were sampled 6 h after the morning feeding. Fish were anesthetized using well aerated water from the rearing system containing MS-222 (3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester, 0.1 g/l), buffered with NaHCO3 (0.2 g/l). Fish were weighed and measured. Blood was extracted from the caudal region in a 1-ml heparinized syringe. Plasma was obtained after 5 min centrifugation at 10,000 rpm and samples obtained were aliquoted and stored -20 \u00baC for later analysis. Fish were euthanized by slicing the cervical spine. Fish were dissected to remove the liver and the gastrointestinal tract (for microbiome analysis). From the terminal part of the gastrointestinal tract feces were extracted by squeezing feces out of fish\u2019s gut into a sterile recipient. A subset of this samples was analyzed for metabolomic analysis (digesta). For microbiome analysis samples were stored in 96% ethanol and at -20 \u00baC until DNA extraction.</p>",
