                "description": "<p>Premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) is a disease featured by early menopause before 40\u2009years of age, accompanied by an elevation of follicle-stimulating hormone. Though POI affects many aspects of women's health, its major causes remain unknown. Many clinical studies have shown that POI patients are generally underweight, indicating a potential correlation between POI and metabolic disorders. To understand the pathogenesis of POI, we performed metabolomics analysis on serum and identified branch-chain amino acid (BCAA) insufficiency-related metabolic disorders in two independent cohorts from two clinics. A low BCAA diet phenotypically reproduced the metabolic, endocrine, ovarian and reproductive changes of POI in young C57BL/6J mice. A mechanism study revealed that the BCAA insufficiency-induced POI is associated with abnormal activation of the ceramide-reactive oxygen species (ROS) axis and consequent impairment of ovarian granulosa cell function. Significantly, the dietary supplement of BCAA prevented the development of ROS-induced POI in female mice. The results of this pathogenic study will lead to the development of specific therapies for POI.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Untargeted lipidomics</strong> is reported in the current study&nbsp;<a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS6249' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS6249</strong></a>.</p><p><strong>Targeted metabolomics</strong> is reported in&nbsp;<a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS6267' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><strong>MTBLS6267</strong></a>.</p>",

POI was defined as oligo/amenorrhea for at least 4 months with an elevated FSH level &gt;25 IU/L on two occasions &gt;4 weeks apart. All the enrolled patients were carefully consulted. Patients with autoimmune diseases or family history of reproductive diseases were excluded from the study. No abnormality was revealed in genetic and immunological test. None of the POI patients were exposed to any kinds of endocrine therapies for POI when they were recruited, except the patients for ROS detection. The blood of the control group was collected during menstruation, while the blood of POI patients was collected randomly. All animal experiments were performed according to procedures approved by the Fudan University OB&amp;GYN Hospital ethical committee. </p><p><br></p><p>Mice were maintained under a 12 h light/12h dark cycle at constant temperature (23 \u00b0C) with free access to food and water.

The mice on special diet were fed with low BCAA diet (Trophic Animal Feed High-tech Co., Ltd) for 4 weeks before mating or sacrifice. Toxin-induced POI mouse model was established by injection of Tripterygium Glycosides (TG) at 50 mg/kg from YUAN DA FEI YUN PHARMACY once per day for 5 weeks. The serum was collected via tail vein. The ovary was collected after the mice were sacrificed. LC-MS/MS analysis was conducted by He Huang (Fudan University, China).</p>",

Next, 200 \u00b5L water, 1 mL methanol and 5 mL MTBE were added to the glass centrifuge tube following a 1 min vortexing. Once incubating the mixture one a rotator for 1 h at room temperature, 1.5 mL more water was added to the mixture and vortexed for another 1 min. The mixture was then centrifuged at 1000 x g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C to separate the two phases; the upper phase containing non-polar lipids and the lower phase containing aqueous metabolites. Two phases were separated collected and dried using a SpeedVac at room temperature.

The identification of untargeted lipidomic results is following certain criteria. Once the .raw files were acquired from LC-MS/MS, we searched the lipid feature using LipidSearch with such parameters: 1) Precursor tolerance 5 ppm and product tolerance 5 ppm; 2) Relative intensity threshold for the parent ion is 0.01% and product ion is 1.0%; 3) The peak extraction for m/z is \u00b15 ppm and \u00b10.5 min for the RT; 4) S/N threshold is 3 for the MS1 and 1 for the MS2 peaks. To ensure the positive lipid identification, we filtered the lipids based on top-ranked features which m-score is higher than 5.0 and C-score is higher than 2.0. The lipid features also selected under FA priority and ID quality including A/B/C scores.</p>",
