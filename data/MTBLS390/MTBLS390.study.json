                "description": "<p>Adipose tissue functions in terms of energy homeostasis as a rheostat for blood triglyceride, regulating its concentration, in response to external stimuli. In addition it acts as a barometer to inform the central nervous system of energy levels which can vary dramatically between meals and according to energy demand. Here a metabolomic approach, combining both Mass Spectrometry and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy, was used to analyse both white and brown adipose tissue in mice with adipocyte-specific deletion of Arntl (also known as Bmal1), a gene encoding a core molecular clock component. The results are consistent with a peripheral circadian clock playing a central role in metabolic regulation of both brown and white adipose tissue in rodents and show that Arntl induced global changes in both tissues which were distinct for the two types. In particular, anterior subcutaneous white adipose tissue (ASWAT) tissue was effected by a reduction in the degree of unsaturation of fatty acids, while brown adipose tissue (BAT) changes were associated with a reduction in chain length. In addition the aqueous fraction of metabolites in BAT were profoundly affected by Arntl disruption, consistent with the dynamic role of this tissue in maintaining body temperature across the day/night cycle and an upregulation in fatty acid oxidation and citric acid cycle activity to generate heat during the day when rats are inactive (increases in 3-hydroxybutyrate and glutamate), and increased synthesis and storage of lipids during the night when rats feed more (increased concentrations of glycerol, choline and glycerophosphocholine).</p><p><br></p><p>The data and protocols of GC-FID assay are reported in current study MTBLS390. </p><p>The data and protocols for UPLC-QTOF-MS assay are reported in study MTBLS380. </p><p>The data and protocols for NMR assay are reported in study MTBLS382.</p>",

Mice were fed on a standard chow diet prior to the study. Mice were kept under an artificial light/dark, day/night, cycle: Lights were turned on at T0 and off at T12. Sampling at T0 and T18 therefore reflects metabolism during the night whilst T6 and T12 reflects metabolism during the day. Mice were euthanized under infrared light for tissue collection under circadian time. Adipose tissues (50-100 mg wet weight) were dissected under light and frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen. Typically tissue was dissected within 1 min post mortem. All procedures were kept constant between controls and Arntl-/- mice. Studies were performed in accordance with the protocol approved by the University of Pennsylvania Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Mouse genotypes were assessed by PCR on genomic DNA from tail tips.\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Georgios K Paschos, Salam Ibrahim, Wen-Liang Song, Takeshige Kunieda, Gregory Grant, Teresa M Reyes, Christopher A Bradfield, Cheryl H Vaughan, Michael Eiden, Mojgan Masoodi, Julian L Griffin, Fenfen Wang, John A Lawson, Garret A Fitzgerald, Obesity in mice with adipocyte-specific deletion of clock component Arntl.

For each tissue sample 600 \u03bcl of methanol:chloroform (2:1 v/v) was added to 20 mg of frozen tissue. After being pulverised in a tissue lyser (Qiagen, UK) for 2 min at a frequency of 17/s, the sample was sonicated for 15 min. Following this, 200 \u03bcl of chloroform and 200 \u03bcl of waterwas added, then centrifuged for 10 min at 13,000 rpm. The separated aqueous and lipid phases were collected. The procedure was repeated twice. The organic fraction was left to dry in the fume hood under nitrogen gas overnight and the aqueous fraction was dried in an evacuated centrifuge.\n</p>\n50 \u03bcl of D-25 tridecanoic acid (200 \u03bcM in chloroform), 650 \u03bcl of chloroform/methanol (1:1 v/v) and 125 \u03bcl BF3/methanol (Sigma- Aldrich) was added to 100 \u03bcl of the lipid extract. The samples were then incubated at 80 \u00baC for 90 min. 500 \u03bcl of H2O and 1 ml of hexane were added, the organic layer separated and dried under a stream of nitrogen as described previously[2]. The sample was reconstituted in 200 \u03bcl of hexane and analyzed on a Focus GC followed by the introduction of the eluent into a FID (Thermo Electron Corporation, Hemel Hempstead, UK).\n</p>\nRef:</br>\n[1] Le Belle, J.E., et al., A comparison of cell and tissue extraction techniques using high-resolution 1H-NMR spectroscopy.
