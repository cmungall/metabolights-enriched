                "description": "<p>N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) may prevent retinal vascular abnormalities observed in oxygen-induced retinopathy, a model of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). In the OmegaROP prospective cohort study, we showed that preterm infants who will develop ROP accumulate the n-6 PUFA arachidonic acid (ARA) at the expense of the n-3 PUFA docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in erythrocytes with advancing gestational age (GA). As mice lacking plasmalogens \u2015that are specific phospholipids considered as reservoirs of n-6 and n-3 PUFAs\u2015 display a ROP-like phenotype, the aim of this study was to determine whether plasmalogens are responsible for the changes observed in subjects from the OmegaROP study. Accordingly, preterm infants aged less than 29 weeks GA were recruited at birth in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit of University Hospital Dijon, France. Blood was sampled very early after birth to avoid any nutritional influence on its lipid composition. The lipid composition of erythrocytes and the structure of phospholipids including plasmalogens were determined by global lipidomics using liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS). LC-HRMS data confirmed our previous observations by showing a negative association between the erythrocyte content in phospholipid esterified to n-6 PUFAs and GA in infants without ROP (rho = -0.485, p = 0.013 and rho = -0.477, p = 0.015 for ethanolamine and choline total phospholipids, respectively). Phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn) species with ARA, namely PtdCho16:0/20:4 (rho = -0.511, p &lt; 0.01) and PtdEtn18:1/20:4 (rho = -0.479, p = 0.015), were the major contributors to the relationship observed. On the contrary, preterm infants developing ROP displayed negative association between PtdEtn species with n-3 PUFAs and GA (rho = -0.380, p = 0.034). They were also characterized by a positive association between GA and the ratio of ethanolamine plasmalogens (PlsEtn) with n-6 PUFA to PlsEtn with n-3 PUFAs (rho = 0.420, p = 0.029), as well as the ratio of PlsEtn with ARA to PlsEtn with DHA (rho = 0.843, p = 0.011). Altogether, these data confirm the potential accumulation of n-6 PUFAs with advancing GA in erythrocytes of infants developing ROP. These changes may be partly due to plasmalogens.</p>",

A 0.5-ml blood sample was collected by venipuncture in a heparinized tube within the first 48 h of life. Red blood cells were immediately separated from plasma by centrifugation at 1860 x g at 4 \u00b0C. The red blood cell pellet was then washed 3x with an isotonic saline solution. Samples were stored at -80 \u00b0C until lipidomic analyses.</p><p><br></p><p>ROP screening was performed with the wide-field RETCAM II camera (Clarity Medical Systems; Pleasanton, CA, United States) using a lid speculum after topical anesthesia by chlorhydrate oxybuprocaine, 1.6 mg/0.4 ml (Thea, Clermont-Ferrand, France). Pupillary dilation was previously performed using one drop of tropicamide, 2 mg/0.4 ml, Thea, Clermont-Ferrand, France). The procedure was completed by a trained nurse and all fundus photographs were analyzed by 2 trained pediatrics-specialized ophthalmologists. Screening began at 4-6 wk of life but never before 31 wk of postconceptional age (PCA). Fundus imaging was repeated every other week until 39 wk PCA if no ROP was detected, and every week or up to twice a week in case of ROP. ROP staging was determined according to the International Classification of ROP<strong>[2]</strong>. Subjects were classified in the group suffering from ROP (ROP group) or in the group of unaffected controls (no-ROP group). Within the ROP group, subjects were classified into type 1 ROP and type 2 ROP. The major risks of developing ROP, namely gestational age (GA), weight at birth, duration of mechanical ventilation, sepsis, use of erythropoietin, red blood cell transfusion and cerebral hemorrhage were documented.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Refs:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Pallot C, Mazzocco J, Meillon C, Semama DS, Chantegret C, Ternoy N, Martin D, Donier A, Gregoire S, Creuzot-Garcher CP, Bron AM, Bretillon L, Acar N.

Due to the lack of available lipid standards representing individual molecular species of EtnGpl and ChoGpl, the abundances of ChoGpl and EtnGpl molecular species was reported as the percentage of the total ChoGpl or EtnGpl ion abundance, respectively (after normalization on the PtdCho14:0/14:0 and PtdEtn14:0/14:0 internal standards).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Statistical analyses:</strong></p><p>Statistical analysis was performed using <strong>GraphPad Prism v6.05</strong> (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, United States), <strong>XLSTAT v2018.02.50494</strong> (Addinsoft, Paris, France), and <strong>R Project v4.0.2</strong> (Revolutions). Quantitative data were expressed as median and interquartile range [<strong>IQR</strong>]. The groups were compared using the nonparametric <strong>Mann-Whitney test</strong> for quantitative variables and the <strong>Chi-2 test</strong> or <strong>Fisher exact test</strong> for qualitative variables. The <strong>Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery adjusted p-value</strong> was applied to correct for multiple testing. Linear regression analyses were used to determine the <strong>R-squared (R2)</strong> correlation coefficient values. <strong>Spearman correlations</strong> were carried out to compare the levels of individual or total levels of phospholipids and ratios as a function of GA. A <strong>p-value</strong> lower than 0.05 was considered as statistically significant and the tests were <strong>2-tailed</strong>.</p>",
